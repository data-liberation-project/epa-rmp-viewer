(PPG) and is operated by LeSaint Logistics.  The Lima Distribution Center is a part of the PPG Automotive Refinish business in the Performance Coatings Strategic Business Unit within PPG.  The facility stores automotive refinish paints, primers, and associated products.  These products are distributed to both internal refinish distribution centers and external distributors throughout North America and worldwide.  The facility stores some aerosol spray cans that contain RMP regulated substances used as aerosol propellants. These materials are regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan standard, 40 CFR 68.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe PPG Refinish - Lima Distribution Center complies with all applicable state and federal regulations including Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation requirements.  The facility's emergency response plan is defined in the LeSaint Safety and Emergency Manual as well as the Lima, Ohio PPG Industries Hazardous Waste Contingency and Emergency Plan.  These manuals provide instruction on how to handle emergencies that may arise in the facility.  The facility's employees are also trained in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, spill response, safe material handling, and fork truck safety.  \n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nEPA RMP requires that worst case release scenarios are analyzed for each process covered under the RMP standard.  The guidelines require that the scenario considers the maximum amount of a material that can be released.  The scenario considers a vapor cloud release due to an explosion of the largest regulated container.   \n\nThe scenario performed considers offsite consequences of the larg"

      "SummaryText": "est quantity of one aerosol container with propellant comprised of equal amounts of propane, butane, isobutane, and ethane.  The largest container used to store aerosols at the facility is less than one pound. For this reason one pound was considered in the worst-case scenario.  The scenario was modeled using the EPA's RMP*Comp software.  The analysis resulted in a release that traveled 31.68 feet (0.006 miles).  Due to the limitations of the RMP*eSubmit software, 0.01 miles were reported (52.8 feet).  Based on the data and the criteria given by the EPA, this scenario does not have an offsite consequence.\n\nSince the facility does not have any public receptors within the endpoint of the Worst Case Scenario, it is considered Program Level 1 and thus does not require an alternative release scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe PPG Refinish - Lima Distribution Center has been identified as Program Level 1, thus the worst case release has no off-site consequences.  The RMP standard does not require the submission of Prevention Program information for Program Level 1 facilities, per 40 CFR 68.12(b).\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no releases at the PPG Refinish - Lima Distribution Center in the past 5 years that resulted in an on-site or off-site impact.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe PPG Refinish - Lima Distribution Center coordinates emergency response procedures with the Fort Shawnee Township Fire Department, St. Rita's Medical Center, and Allen County Sheriff's Department EMA/LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPPG is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations. Changes are made on an ongoing basis, as necessary. For additional information, contact Michael Bellantis at (740)368-7405.\n\n"
