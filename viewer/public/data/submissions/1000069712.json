      "SummaryText": "A VPP and ERT\r\nThe LyondellBasell La Porte facility and our onsite contractor Austin Industries have been an OSHA Voluntary Protection Program recognized A\u00bfSTAR WorksiteA\u00bf since August 2001.  The Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) promotes effective worksite-based safety and health. In the VPP, management, labor, and OSHA establish cooperative relationships at workplaces that have implemented a comprehensive safety and health management system. Approval into VPP is OSHAA\u00bfs official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program, LyondellBasell La Porte has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment. One program that enhances our ability to respond to emergencies is our Emergency Response Program. Members of the Emergency Response Team (ERT) undergo training that includes classroom and on-the-job training as well as regular emergency drills. A highly trained and confident ERT can limit damage during an emergency event, but more importantly prompt emergency response can prevent more serious accidents from occurring. Our teams regularly attend some of the best training programs available, in particular, the programs conducted at Texas A&M University."
