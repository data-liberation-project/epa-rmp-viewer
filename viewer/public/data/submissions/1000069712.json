This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at LyondellBasell La Porte. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\nLyondellBasell La PorteA?s primary activities encompass olefins, and polymer and resins manufacturing.

The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are unit Process Hazard Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, LyondellBasell La Porte maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.

The Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) promotes effective worksite-based safety and health. In the VPP, management, labor, and OSHA establish cooperative relationships at workplaces that have implemented a comprehensive safety and health management system. Approval into VPP is OSHAA?s official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.\n\n\n\nAs a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program, LyondellBasell La Porte has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment. One program that enhances our ability to respond to emergencies is our Emergency Response Program. Members of the Emergency Response Team (ERT) undergo training that includes classroom and on-the-job training as well as regular emergency drills. A highly trained and confident ERT can limit damage during an emergency event, but more importantly prompt emergency response can prevent more serious accidents from occurring. Our teams regularly attend some of the best training programs available, in particular, the programs conducted at Texas A&M University.\n\n\n\n"
