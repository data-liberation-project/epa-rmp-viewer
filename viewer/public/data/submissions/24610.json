This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental  release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the  processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\t\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution.

To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Hydroxide.  In this scenario 2472lbs. of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited by a system of administrative controls.  Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  These mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the spread of product.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\u00a0\nProcess Safety Information\nBrenntag Southeast Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\u00a0\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 11/14/01.\n\u00a0\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Southeast Inc maintains written operating procedures.
