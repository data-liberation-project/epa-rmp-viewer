      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIn June 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized regulations for Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act that required risk management planning to help prevent accidental releases of 139 hazardous and flammable substances.  A Risk Management Plan (RMP) must be completed for facilities that process and/or store chemicals above the established threshold limits.  The RMP details steps for prevention of possible accidents related to unintentional chemical releases.  JLM Chemicals, Inc. (JLM) has a RMP because the facility processes and stores propane and propylene above the established threshold quantities.  This first RMP for JLM was completed in June 1999.  This is the updated RMP (to be completed 5 years later).\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\nJLM approaches accidental release prevention by participating in multiple safety programs that focus on prevention of explosions and fires and releases of regulated chemicals from the Cumene Process.  The initial approach is accomplished through the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  The PSM Program is designed to provide an overall framework of operating practices, procedures, and documentation to allow for the safe operation of the facility.\n\nSecondly, as a member of the Chemical Manufacturer?s Association (CMA), JLM is obligated to actively participate in the Responsible Care Program.  The Responsible Care Program is a commitment by JLM Management to continually improve performance in the environmental, health, and safety areas at the facility.  Some examples of Responsible Care Program commitments include working closely with local emergency responders, such as fire departments to plan and prepare for possible accidents, and conducting continuous employee training and emergency response training.\n\n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nJLM is located in Alsip, Illinois.  The facility consists of a Cumene Process, Phenol Process, and several chem"

      "SummaryText": "ical storage tanks.  Benzene and propylene are reacted to form cumene and cumene hydroperoxide in the Cumene Process.  The cumene is then utilized in the Phenol Process to produce phenol, acetone, and alpha-methyl styrene.  The only process at this facility subject to the RMP requirements is the production of cumene in the Cumene Process.  The chemicals in this process subject to the RMP requirements are propylene and propane.\n\nThe Cumene Process begins with JLM receiving a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) blend of propylene/propane either by pipeline, railroad cars, or tank trucks.  The blend can range from 71% propylene to 93% propylene.  The LPG (as a raw material) is fed directly into the Cumene Process area or to a storage tank (with a maximum capacity of 162,000 lbs.) for later use.  In the Cumene Unit, the propylene is reacted with benzene to produce cumene, an intermediate product used in the production of phenol and acetone.  The propane does not undergo a chemical reaction and is subsequently removed from the process in the depropanizer.  The propane is then either sold as a product or used internally as fuel.  The RMP threshold quantities for propylene and propane are 10,000 lbs. each.  The amounts of propylene and propane onsite at JLM both exceed that threshold, and therefore, an RMP is necessary.   Both chemicals are considered flammable, but not toxic.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\nMany of the programs at JLM that relate to accidental release prevention were reviewed and updated in June 2004.  The following are accidental release prevention programs and safety programs that JLM has implemented to prevent accidental releases of propylene and/or propane:\n1.Process Safety Management (PSM) Program in order to meet the requirements of the OSHA PSM rule.  Elements of the PSM Program were reviewed relative to the RMP Program requirements.\n2.Employee Participation Program\n3.Ongoing compilation and an update of process safety information\n4.Management of"

This is the only process (due to the propylene and propane components) that is subject to the RMP requirements at JLM.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\nJLM has it?s own Emergency Response Program for the facility.  When the alarm is activated, JLM employees that make up the fire brigade will respond.  A fire truck, foam trailer, six monitors, fire hydrants, and fire extinguishers are located on site for fire emergencies.  In addition, JLM has two independent fire pumps for emergencies.  The electric fire pump is fed city water and the diesel fire pump is fed canal water.  JLM has also made arrangements with the local fire departments for emergency response procedures.  The Alsip Fire Department has primary responsibility to respond to emergencies at JLM.  The Blue Island Fire Department and other fire departments in the area are expected to respond to emergencies at the facility if necessary.  Both the Alsip Fire Department and the Blue Island Fire Department can be contacted by phone (regular or dedicated phone line) and by radio.  These communication devices are located in the Control Room at JLM.  The local fire and emergency re"
