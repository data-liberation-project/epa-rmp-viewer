The Westend Facility is owned and operated by Searles Valley Minerals which is a sub-division of Nirma Limited.  Searles Valley Minerals' initial submittal for this facility was made to USEPA and to the San Bernardino County Fire Department on June 21, 1999.  Subsequent updates have been provided per the Five Year Update schedule or more frequently.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning and update requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (also known as the Federal Risk Management Plan Regulations) and the California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Article 3, Section 2745.3 (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan - CalARP RMP Regulations).  The scope of the Federal RMP and CalARP RMP includes all operations conducted at the subject facility that involve the storage, handling and/or use of anhydrous ammonia (i.e., anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Westend Facility above the threshold quantity).\n\nSearles Valley Minerals is strongly committed to the health and safety of its employees, the public and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the comprehensive accidental release prevention program implemented at the Westend Facility covering aspects of operations such as design, installation, operations and maintenance, training, emergency response and other areas.

Searles Valley Minerals extracts, chemically processes and ships minerals and inorganic chemical compounds to customers all over the world.  The company currently produces soda ash, sodium borates, boric acid and natural sulfate.  \n\nDescription of Regulated Substance Use\nSearles Valley Minerals' Westend Facility produces borax and sodium sulfate by processing Brines obtained from Searles Lake.  \nAnhydrous ammonia is used (in the manufacturing of borax and sodium sulfate) as a refrigerant (for cooling) in a closed loop system.  The cooling process (i.e., the use of anhydrous ammonia) is a 24-hour per day, 365-day per year operation that is essential to manufacturing operations conducted at the Westend Facility.\n\nThere are two distinct uses of anhydrous ammonia at the Westend Facility:\n\n1.\tTo chill brine in the borax manufacturing process (thus removing the heat of crystallization);and\n2.\tTo chill brine in the sulfate crystallization process. \n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage, handling and use system at the Westend Facility consists of the following major components:\n\u00bf\tThe main high pressure receiver;\n\u00bf\tTwo liquid recirculating units (LRUs);\n\u00bf\tSeven ammonia compressors;\n\u00bf\tSix evaporative condensers (i.e., cooling towers);\n\u00bf\tTransfer piping and supports; and\n\u00bf\tProcess instrumentation, detection and monitoring devices.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage, handling and use system at the Westend Facility consists of an assortment of process vessels, heat exchangers and compressors connected via an extensive network of piping in a closed loop system.  Anhydrous ammonia is kept under high pressure (and therefore in a liquefied form) in the main High Pressure Receiver (HPR).  The HPR supplies two Liquid Recirculating Units (LRUs 3 and 4) each of which is dedicated to a specific process at the Westend Facility.  The LRUs in turn supply liquid ammonia t"

      "SummaryText": "o their process where the pressure of liquid ammonia is reduced through expansion valves.  This pressure reduction results in a transformation of liquid ammonia to vapor phase and results in cooling.  As the ammonia vapor moves through the process, unwanted heat is transferred from the process to the ammonia vapor indirectly (the desired end result).  This indirect heat transfer results in a warming of the ammonia vapor (thus losing its cooling value).  The ammonia vapor is therefore compressed, cooled indirectly (in condensers/cooling towers), liquefied and returned to the main High Pressure Receiver (making it available again).  LRU No. 3 is dedicated to the Sulfate Crystallization Process while LRU No. 4 is dedicated to the Borax Manufacturing Process.\n\nSite Security\nA chain link fence surrounds the Westend Facility.  Additionally, the Facility is protected via manned 24-hour security.  These site security provisions are intended to prevent unauthorized access to Facility areas including those areas where anhydrous ammonia is stored, handled or used, thus adding a level of safety for the storage of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility.\n\nES 2.0\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n\u00bf\tthe worst case release; and\n\u00bf\tan alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario).\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nIn this scenario, the main Anhydrous Ammonia Liquid Recirculating Unit on site experiences a catastrophic failure du"

It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event.  However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded.  This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely.  In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 68,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia could be released (administrative controls limit the vessel's capacity to 85-percent full).  The release of ammonia would occur outdoors.  Thus, it was assumed that the ammonia released during the catastrophic accident forms a cloud of ammonia vapor which is free to migrate off-site.  No liquid pooling was considered to occur during the release (this assumption is conservative in nature and results in the largest estimated vulnerable zone).  Utilizing the The RMP*Comp Model, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 4.2-miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nAlternative release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur are those which may result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 8,460 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  These scenarios include situations such as accidental releases 0.25 inch diameter orifice leading to an airborne release, representative of a release from process piping .  The resulting cloud of ammonia vapor was assumed to freely migrate off-site.  Utilizing the USEPA's RMP*COMP Software Program, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately .24-miles.\n\nES 3.0\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of the Year 2019 Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update (i.e., from July 8, 2014 through July 8, 2019), the Facility has NOT had any releases of anhydrous ammonia that have"

These programs include design and operating controls such as compliance with specified codes, the Company's health and safety program, numerous standard operating procedures, the equipment inspection and maintenance program (including a mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance program), the management of change program, pre-start-up review, fire protection and hot work permit programs, management of- and safety of- contractors, accident/incident investigation procedures, emergency response plans, the Federal RMP/CalARP RMP/OSHA PSM Program compliance auditing program, the Federal RMP/CalARP RMP/OSHA PSM Program record keeping program and a variety of personnel training programs.  Details of each of these components of the Facility's Accidental Release Prevention Program are provided in the document entitled Federal Risk Management Plan (Federal RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan (CalARP RMP), OSHA Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM) Program, Volume I - Prevention Program.  \n\nThere are a number of detection and monitoring devices and alarms designed to ensure the continued safe operation of the Westend Facility's Processes (i.e., which encompasses the storage, handling and use of anhydrous ammonia).

These Plans include ALL aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation and notification of LERC/LEPD and the Public.\n\nALL emergency response equipment is frequently tested, inspected and serviced to ensure proper functioning.  The emergency evacuation sirens are tested every Friday at noon.  In addition, the emergency response plans are reviewed periodically and updated (as needed) to reflect pertinent changes in processes, operations and/or personnel that may require a modified emergency response.  Emergency response drills and exercises are conducted periodically to ensure rapid response and effectiveness of the emergency response team.  ALL employees and contractors are trained in the requirements of these emergency response plans.\n\nIn the unlikely event that a release does occur, Searles Valley Minerals environmental, health and safety (EHS) staff and HAZWOPER trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Searles Valley Minerals coordinates its emergency response actions and efforts with several State and County Agencies.  These activities provide additional emergency response expertise to both the community and Searles Valley Minerals facilities.\n\nES 6.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA detailed hazard and operability study update is currently under review and any findings will be reviewed and addressed accordingly. A comprehensive hazard and operability study (HAZOP) covering all operations involving anhydrous ammonia was conducted during the initial Risk Management Plan (RMP) to improve safety at the Westend Facility and assess risks of accidental releases. This study has been revalidated during each of the Five-Year Updates, and all recommended actions from these reviews have been fully implemented.\n\n\n\nES"
