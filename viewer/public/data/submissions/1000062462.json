Management has a safety-first attitude and is in compliance with all OSHA PSM Standards.\n\nStadelman Fruit's Cherry Facility on 200 Northstone Parkway in Zillah, Washington packs fresh cherries exclusively during appx. 3 summer months.  It is a state-of-the-art facility that includes a 91,000 square foot packing floor and three Controlled Atmosphere rooms.  Ammonia is used in CA rooms and in hydrocoolers.  All ammonia processes are fed by one machine room.  Ammonia refrigeration keeps cherries cold throughout the process.  A total of 16,000 lbs. of ammonia is used in the refrigeration process.\n\nThis facility closely follows the OSHA PSM Standards and has a well-maintained program that details accident prevention steps while complying with all rules and regulations for a facility its size.  Personnel is involved with training regularly.\n\nThe facility is new and therefore has no accident history.\n\nStadelman Fruit does not have an Emergency Response Plan. An Emergency Action Plan is used and maintained instead.\n\nThere are no upcoming planned changes to the facility. It is new and any updates/changes will be addressed as necessary. As the facility changes and grows, safety will change and grow along with it.\n\n"
