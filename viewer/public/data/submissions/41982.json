This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Toca Gas Plant located in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C. (formally known as Tejas Gas Processing, L.L.C.) and is operated by Enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Toca Gas Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of two processing plants, Toca I and Toca II.  Toca I is a refrigerated lean oil absorption plant while Toca II is a cryogenic plant.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility via pipeline.  Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems.\r\n\r\nThe Toca Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\r\n\r\nListed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Toca Gas Plant are rich/lean oil, raw make, propane, natural gas, heating oil and slop oil.  However, Enterprise has determined that heating oil and slop oil have an NFPA flammability rating of 2 and 3 respectively, which exempts these mixtures from threshold determination.  The Plant is su"

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Toca Gas Plant.  Because the processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), regulations are also subject to the OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the plant\u00bfs PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help insure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\r\n\r\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, \u00bfnear-miss\u00bf reporting system and special training program such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\r\n\r\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate e"

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors as well as bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\r\n\r\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Toca Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and c"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Toca Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.
