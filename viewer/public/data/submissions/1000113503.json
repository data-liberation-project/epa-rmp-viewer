(ONS) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations. ONS management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nMorris Storage and Terminal is owned and operated by ONS. At the facility, ethane/propane mix (EP Mix) is stored in an underground storage cavern until it is transferred, via pipeline, to the customer. Butanes, natural gasoline, and propane are received via pipeline and stored in above ground storage tanks until they are loaded on trucks for distribution to customers. Ethyl mercaptan is used as an odorant for propane and is stored at the facility and injected into truck trailers during propane loading. The Risk Management Program (RMP) substances stored at the facility are normal butane, isobutane, propane, ethyl mercaptan, and two flammable mixtures. The flammable mixtures are EP Mix, containing ethane and propane; and natural gasoline, containing pentane and other non-RMP hydrocarbons. No RMP toxic substances are present at the facility. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe a"

These high standards include:\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n-\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\n \nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMorris Storage and Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n?\tHazardous atmosphere monitors (HAM) have been installed at the facility, which will shutdown power to the loading facility upon a positive reading.\n?\tManual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons have been installed at the facility in order to shut down the entire facility during emergency situations.\n?\tFire eyes have been installed at the terminal in various locations to warn of a fire at the facility.\n?\tA continuous flare is tied into critical equipment to minimize the possibility of releases.\n?\tThe facility is manned 24 hours per day, which improves response time in the event of a release.\n?\tThe Tulsa Control Center can detect high and low pressure on the pipeline and storage vessels as well as levels on storage vessels, and remotely close inlet and outlet valves, if necessary.\n?\tAll drivers are provided with driver loading safet"

The Operations Supervisor is responsible for coordinating emergency actions.
