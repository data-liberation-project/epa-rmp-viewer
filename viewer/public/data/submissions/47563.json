A key element of its protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\nThe Cognis Corporation Charlotte, NC facility accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from Mecklenburg County emergency response organizations.    Although the facility's programs have been highly successful, it continually seeks ways to improve its prevention and response programs.  \n\nThis document, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility, was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP describes the incident at the facility which would have the most catastrophic effects (\"the worst case\") and a scenario of lesser magnitude (\"alternative case\").  Worst case scenario information is provided in this report to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to the lesser magnitude scenario, which is more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using the RMP*Comp model.  RMP*Comp is an offsite consequence model jointly developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which follows the procedures set out in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysi"

      "SummaryText": "Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nSafe operation of a process starts with a detailed identification of the hazards associated with the process.  The Charlotte facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with each process are identified and controlled.  To do this, each process at the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of trained personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nPHA team findings are submitted to the plant manager for resolution.  Implementation of mitigating options in response to PHAs is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team"

The Charlotte facility maintains extensive technical information about the safe operation of its processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety data.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available in the Process Safety Section of the PSM Manual. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) within the batch cards and operating procedures. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

The procedures describe the safety considerations unique to specific operating modes, e.g\n\n- unit startup, \n- normal operations, \n- temporary operations, \n- emergency shutdown, \n- normal shutdown, and \n- initial startup of a new process.  \n\nThese procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training for new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change (MOC) process that is explained in greater detail in a subsequent section.\n\nIn addition, the facility maintains batch cards and operating procedures that provide guidance on how to respond to upper and lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Refresher training for all operators is conducted every 3 years.  Each training program includes a method of verifying that the operator understood the training through verbal c"

All training is documented.\n\nContractors\n\nThe facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n- perform their work in a safe manner, \n- have the appropriate knowledge and skills, \n- are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \n- understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, \n- understand and follow site safety rules, and \n- inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  \n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n\n- a process overview, \n- information about safety and health hazards, \n- emergency response plan requirements, and \n- safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  \n\nIn addition, the facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe facility conducts a PSSR for any new process or process modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared before placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that process safety management and accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility has well-established practices and procedures to"

The basic aspects of this program include: \n\n- conducting training, \n- developing written procedures, \n- performing inspections and tests, \n- correcting identified deficiencies, and \n- applying quality assurance measures.  \n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel training includes an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service.  If the required parts or equipment are not available, an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment until the required deficiency can be corrected.  The equipment will not be placed back into service unless the MOC team can adequately address the modifications required for the safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that the new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Charlotte facility has long-standing safe work practices to ensure employee and process safety.  Examples of these include:"

To prevent such mistakes, the Charlotte facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with the necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in, a serious situation, e.g. a fire or explosion, a toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results reviewed"
