              "Description": "TheAccidental Release Prevention Program for the City of Aberdeen water Works involves both training and maintenance.  each person hired to serve as a water system operator at our Class IV surface water treatment plant must undergo a rigorous four week training program including safety prodedures in dealing with the following chlorine handling procedures:  offloading and handling one-ton cyclinders; placing one-ton cylinders into operation; connection chlorine cylinders to the vacuum chlorinator system; setting and adjusting dose rates; checking chlorine systems for leaks and potential problems; setting chlorine tank scales; changing vacuum tubing; chleaning chlorination equipment; and attaching andremoving vacuum switching chlorinators from the one-ton cylinders.  Additionally, ongoing training in the wear and service of the MSA personal self contained breathing apparatus and plant emergency reaction procedures is done at least quarterly.  Our maintenance program is proactive towards chlorine release prevention, and involves the periodic inspection and replacement of critical parts in the disinfection system.  We periodically send in chlorinators for rebuild and inspecion to a ualififed service center.  We routinely take a chlorinator out of service annually and replace it with a rebuildt/inspected spare chlorinator.  this ensures the most hazardous component of the system is thoroughly inspected and /or rebuildt each year.  we inspect the chlorinators each time a one-ton cyclinder is shcnged, but his formal servicepcenter inspection is a fail safe method of keeping our chlorinators up-to-par.  The vinyl or teflon vacuum tubing connection the chlorinators to the system is replaced bi-annually as an inexpensive conoutermeasure to failure or leakage.  even though this is a vacuum system, we take precautions to ensure a safe operating system is performing properly.  The chlorine control cabinets are serviced on site every 6 months, and any quiestionable components are immediately replaced.  Our MSA protective masks are hydrotested every five years, checked monlthly for air pressure and cleanliness/seriveablility, and semi-annually inspected by the aberdeen Fire Department.",

This is the only regulated substance handled at the facility, and emergency action measures are in place in the event of the accidental release of the chemical.  Located 7 miles northeast of Aberdeen, the plant is in a rural setting and has had no accidental releases of chlorine in its 75 years of operation at this location.  The exceedingly remote possibility of releasing chlorine gas to the atmosphere in its most extensive case would involve a one-ton cylinder venting its entire contents over the course of 18 minutes.  The cylinders are enclosed within the walls of the building and the facility is surrounded by dikes to contain the heavier-than-air gas.  Using a north wind in the plans down wind safety calculations involves a 3 mile area which includes the residents of the Pariewood development.  Immediate notification through Broun County Dispatch, the Aberdeen Fire Department, and the Brown County Emergency Management Office would turn the situation over to trained emergency responders, which is the first step in the accidental release policy of the water treatment plant.  Further steps secure the safety of plant personnel and people within the concerned area.  The alternate release scenario (most probable accidental release mechanism) chosen for planning purposes would produce an endpoint of the chemical plume no more than 0.1 miles in any direction from the facility (within the borders of the plan grounds).  The plant accidental release prevention program involves strict adherence to maintenance procedures, inspections, and rotation of chlorine dosing equipment components.  Operational training and emergency chemical training is also a very important part of our ongoing prevention program.  Chemical release drills are part of our routine training program, including survivability procedures for plant personnel.  Ou"
