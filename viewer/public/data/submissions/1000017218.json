The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\nAlternate Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated release from a loading rack filter thermal relief valve on an adjacent, non-active loading rack.  The relief valve is assumed to open to vent pressure due to blocked-in thermal expansion of the propane, with the valve failing to reseat, venting the entire quantity of the filter into the loading rack area.  The filter has been calculated to contain 37 gallons (157 pounds) of propane that is released into the loading rack area and explodes in a vapor cloud explosion.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would ensure the isolation of the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.

This material is routed from these tanks to the loading docks for distribution.  Ethyl mercaptan is stored at Alma Terminal and is added to the propane as an odorant during the loading process.  The ethyl-mercaptan at Alma Terminal is present below the threshold quantity for this chemical specified in the RMP Rule. \n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.
