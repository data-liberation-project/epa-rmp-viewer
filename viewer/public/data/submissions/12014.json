A recycle line of propylene and hydrogen is continuously fed into the reactor. The heat generated by the polymerization reaction is removed from the reactor by recycle gas. In the event of an upset, the gas within the reactor will vent to the flare.\n\nImmediately following the reactor, a mixture of unreacted monomer, co-monomers and polymer powder is discharged to the powder degassing vessel where the majority of the unreacted monomer and co-monomers are separated from the powder and recovered. The powder is then discharged to the powder purge vessel where more unreacted monomer and co-monomers are purged out of the powder. This is a stirred vessel which is purged with nitrogen. In this vessel the monomer and comonomer residues are stripped out by a continuous addition of nitrogen.\n\nFrom the purge vessel the powder is sent to the powder buffer silos, via nitrogen conveying system, where it is metered into the extrusion process. The extrusion process consists of a twin-screw extruder with 12 barrels (there are 3 extruders, one per line). The first barrel is cooled with water to a temperature of 98 0F so that no semi-molten sticky material is obtained in the extruder throat. In barrels 2 and 3, the powder is melted by electrical heating. Between barrels 3 and 4, propylene oxide and demineralized water are injected. In barrels 4 and 5, the catalyst is decomposed by the water and the HCl is reacted with the propylene oxide (PO). In barrels 6 and 7, degassing of the Polypropylene melt occurs. Propylenechlorohydrin (PCH), a compound formed by HC1 and PO and excess PO together with heptane, water, propylene, nitrogen and small amounts of the co-monomers are sucked off into two degassing screws on the extruder. This stream is cooled then separated. The oily condensate is transferred to the liquid extruder. This stream is cooled then"

There are three main operations done in this area:\n\n* Solvent throughout the process that contains catalyst fines or butyl chloride (wash solvent is received to the solvent dryer. Prior to evaporation, the butyl chloride is destroyed in a reaction with tri-ethyl aluminum and catalyst fines. The solvent is then vaporized and subsequently condensed for purification.\n\n* The residue from the dryer which is primarily catalyst fines and residual solvent is transferred to a hydrolizer unit for catalyst activity destruction and neutralization. This destruction is exothermic and is accomplished by the addition of water. The hydrolizer unit is jacketed for reaction heat removal. After activity destruction, the slurry is neutralized with caustic.

The pellets are then introduced into the rotary dryer where the pellets are dried. Air is introduced at the top of the rotary drier as the drying medium. The dry pellets fall into a sieve where they are separated by size.\n\nThe pellets are then discharged to the pellet deodorization process. This step is necessary in order to strip out traces of odorous substances (residual VOC). The deodorized grades of Polypropylene pellets are needed for food applications. In the deodorizer a counter-flow stream of steam is used to strip the pellets of residual VOC. The VOC stripped out of the pellets accumulate in the steam; therefore, a slip stream of steam is continuously taken out of the steam recycle loop of the deodorizer. The steam, which contains some hydrocarbons, is cooled down. The oily water is discharged to a separator where the liquid hydrocarbon is recycled back to the process, the water is discharged to wastewater treatment, and the desorbed waste gas is discharged to the incinerator.\n\nThe pellets leaving the deodorizer are cooled in a continuously fluidized bed with air.

Product withdrawn via the lateral withdrawal system is degassed and deactivated before transfer to the pelletization unit. The recovered gas is compressed and returned back to the reactor gas loop.\n\nAdditives and Pelletization (APU):\n\nIn the additives and pelletizing unit, the virgin powder from the polymerization unit is received and blended with special additives for extrusion and pelletization. The product pellets are then pneumatically transferred to the product storage area. A portion of the virgin powder is blended with various additives batch-wise in a solids mixing tank or blender. These additives protect the product during extrusion and improve various characteristics of the customer's finished product. The blended powder is fed with virgin powder to an extrusion unit which heats and compresses the powder until it is liquefied. The liquefied polyethylene is forced out of the extruder through a die plate to the pelletizing unit.\n\nThe die is composed of a steel plate with many small holes.

The reaction required heating for initiation, then cooling for temperature control of the exothermic reaction. The result of this process is a slurry of small reactive catalyst particles which must then be elutriated for catalyst fines removal.\n\nQuantities of the reacting are controlled by the use of pipettes which accurately measure amounts through level control. The reaction is started on the surface of treated magnesium in a hexane solvent solution. Iodine with other minor chemicals are used to remove oxides from the surface of the magnesium. The catalyst reaction is initiated by the reaction of butyl chloride with the treated magnesium metal to form an organomagnesium compound. Once initiated, two titanium based chemicals, titanium tetrachloride and titanium propoxide are reacted with the magnesium compound to produce the catalyst. The progress of the reaction is monitored by the increase of butane in the gas phase composition. The rate of reaction is controlled by the metered addition of butyl chloride to the reactor. Once this charge is completed, there is a timed delay, then a very small charge of water is made. For production of an HDPE catalyst, dimethyl formamide is also added. These last two charges are for adjustments to the catalyst reactivity.\n\nOnce the catalyst slurry has been produced and its reactivity adjusted, the concentration of the catalyst particles in the solvent is adjusted to a recipe concentration.

The used hexane solvent is sent to the solvent recovery unit for purification.\n\n\nPre-polymerization (PPU):\n\nThe primary purpose of this unit is to improve the catalyst particle's receptiveness to hydrocarbons, to increase the particle size of the catalyst particle by the reaction with ethylene, and finally the drying of the prepolymer powder. The catalyst is first reacted with a co-catalyst, tri-octyl aluminum, in a hexane solvent solution. This co-catalyst replaces a chlorine atom on the catalyst molecule with an octyl group to make it more receptive to ethylene and hydrogen. As this new receptive catalyst is produced, ethylene gas is introduced into the reactor to produce small polyethylene particles. Also, a small influx of hydrogen is introduced for molecular weight or melt index control. The reaction is carried out in a hexane solvent primarily for control of the particle temperature. Because of the reactivity of the catalyst particles, a gas phase reaction would result in hot spots and particle agglomeration.\n\nOnce the pre-polymer seed production is completed, the slurry is transferred to a dryer. The solvent is then vaporized and recovered. Finally, the dried pre-polymer powder is transferred by nitrogen downstream for subsequent metering into the polymerization reactor.\n\nPolymerization Unit (PU):\n\nIn the polymerization unit, ethylene and a co-monomer are reacted with injected prepolymer powder in a fluid bed reactor to produce the LLDPE.
