As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112\u00ae Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Agri-Energy, LLC completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored onsite above threshold planning quantities.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAgri-Energy, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant. The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the product unfit for human consumption. It is the policy of Agri-Energy, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws. In the event of an emergency, it is the policy of Agri-Energy, LLC to notify the City of Luverne Fire Department and evacuate all employees from the facility.\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain pentane, an RMP-regulated substance. The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 110,000 pounds. The natural gasoline may contain pentane up to 40 percent by volume (44,000 lbs). The natural gasoline is stored in one tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike. Agri-Energy, LLC has evaluated the worst-cast and alternative case scenarios as it relates to pentane. Emergency response programs for this scenario has been prepared and implemented. Agri-Energy, LLC has coordinated emergency response with the"
