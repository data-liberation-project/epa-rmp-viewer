The following paragraphs describe some of these features.\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde solution: Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  Most of the formaldehyde stored in the plant's storage vessels is piped directly from the formaldehyde plant.  However, to make-up for shortfalls in formaldehyde production, some formaldehyde is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors. The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when off-loading to the formaldehyde storage tanks.  The design and construction of the storage tanks are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde (developed by the plant).   The storage tanks are surrounded by a concrete dike wall.  The containment area is large enough to hold 100% of the volume of the largest tank, plus freeboard associated with incident rainfall, should the tank's entire contents be spilled. Process areas that handle formaldehyde also have containment.  Air emissions from the storage tanks and the process reactors are directed to a thermal oxidizer, which destroys in excess of 95% of the formaldehyde emissions.\r\n\r\nAmmonium hydroxide solution (30%):  Ammonia solution is purchased from an approved offsite vendor and delivered by DOT approved tank truck.
