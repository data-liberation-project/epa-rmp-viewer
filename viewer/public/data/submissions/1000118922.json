We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant located in Glasscick County, Texas at 14110 E. County Road 230, Midland, Texas 79701.  \n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant is a three train cryogenic natural gas proessing plant with condensate stabilization located in Loving County, Texas\n\nThe NGL Extraction process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities to be kept on site based on the process design of the proposed process vessels.\n\nListed flammable substances which are present ab"

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Mentone Gas Plant.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Mentone Gas Plant facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Mentone Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant has safety features on many units to h"

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Mentone Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Mentone Gas Plant.\n\n* No changes are planned."
