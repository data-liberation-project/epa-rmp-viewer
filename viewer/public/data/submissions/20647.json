Royal Valley Growers Association chose Cold Storage Technologies \nto review it\u00bfs existing policy\u00bfs, procedures, documentation and refrigeration system for \ncompliance with new requirements. After the review Royal Valley Growers Association \ndecided to choose to implement an Ammonia industry standard for regulation \ncompliance. The IIAR Guidelines provide Ammonia Refrigeration specific detailed \ntemplates that are customized for a specific facility. Resources used in the process were \nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Guidelines and RMP Pro 98 \nOCA Software by Dyadem. \n\nExecutive Summary organization includes; Certification statement, Summary, Detailed \nElements and Map of Potential Impact. A current copy of RMP, PSM and PHA materials \ncan be reviewed at the facility by contacting Ken Suemoto. Since the materials consist of \nseveral 2 binders and facility drawings which are constantly updated as changes are \nimplemented, any reproduction becomes obsolete at the time of printing. \n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the \nChemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \nThis facility will not make specific RMP or OCA information available to the public until \na final ruling is made. General details only will be discussed at a required public meeting \nscheduled for 1/12/2000. Any accidental or authorized release of information in section \n2-5 by government officials violates Federal Law.\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Royal Valley Fruit Growers Association are strongly committed to employee, \npublic and environmental safety.
