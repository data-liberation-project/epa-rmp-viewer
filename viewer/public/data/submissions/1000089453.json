Box 889,  Perryton, TX 79070\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material at our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is   NAICS code 424510, \"Grain and Field Bean Merchant Wholesalers\" however we also receive anhydrous ammonia in railcars or truck transports for use by an outside contractor to produce liquid fertilizer.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for this activity is NAICS code 325314, \"Fertilizer (Mixing Only) Manufacturing.\" Anhydrous ammonia is the only product at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Planning at this time.   \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received and stored in truck transports for filling a bulk storage vessel, which is then used by an outside contractor to produce liquid fertilizer through a mobile pipe reactor (MPR).  The MPR is typically on site for less than a week 6-8 times per year. During the balance of the year there is minimal anhydrous ammonia on site.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the 130,00 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with only the contractor's employees present during the transfer and reacting process. Our employees are present only when the railcars or transports arrive to visually inspect the DOT-specification cargo tanks for compliance.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site therefore item number"

      "SummaryText": " 1.11 is Zero. Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times of day and night when anhydrous ammonia is present. Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of the single bulk storage vessel.  The maximum quantity released based on 85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06), as well as possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.   \n\n\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by damage to, or catastrophic failure of a transfer hose connected from a bulk storage vessel to the MPR. This could lead to the total loss of product in the hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is determined per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. ANSI/CGA 2.1-2014 \"Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".   We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia, performing visual inspections of the fixed facility and DOT-specification railcars and transports, review of contractor policies and procedures, and how to contact emergency responders in the event there is a release. We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; "
