      "SummaryText": "1. Introduction\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan for Aurora Distribution Center - 3M Company. We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community. As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history. 3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975. Since 1990, 3M has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 80 percent, and releases to water 75 percent.\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees. If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the local Fire Department and other emergency responders arrive. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response.\n\n3. The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis location is a distribution center and warehouse for finished goods, primarily in small containers intended for consumer use. We have four regulated flammable substances, and no regulated toxic substances, at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program. 3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and we contribute to safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance.\n\nThe following regulated substances are used at Aurora Distribution Center - 3M Company:\n-Isobutane, pentane, and methyl ether are flammable gases that are used as propellants in aerosol cans.

      "SummaryText": "as directed all affected facilities to share with their communities a look at the worst possible accident that could happen at the facility, as unlikely as that might be. EPA has defined the worst case scenario as the release of the entire contents of the single largest container. For Aurora Distribution Center - 3M Company, one scenario was analyzed, for flammable substance release.\n\nThe worst case scenario analyzed for flammables was the release of the total contents of the largest aerosol can with the highest flammable content. Propane was selected because it has the highest heat of combustion of the materials stored, and therefore the greatest distance to endpoint. Analysis was performed using equations provided in EPA guidance documents. \n\nThe results of the worst case release analysis, combined with the five year history showing no accidental releases, qualify this as a Program 1 process. Therefore, alternative release scenarios are not required.\n\n\n5. Aurora Distribution Center - 3M Company Program to Prevent Accidental Releases\n\nAt Aurora Distribution Center - 3M Company, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program. Programs are in place to address accidental release prevention measures consistent with appropriate federal, state, and local requirements. Beyond government requirements, we have 3M internal standards for continuously improving safety at our facility.\n\nReflecting the low risk and the five year history showing no accidental releases at this facility, EPA criteria for Program 1 designation are met and specific prevention program elements are not addressed in this plan.\n\n6. Five-year Accident History\n\nAt Aurora Distribution Center - 3M Company, no level of accident is acceptable. We work continually to reduce the number and severity of accidents at our operations. In the five years preceding submittal of this plan, there were no accidental releases with on-site or off-site consequences"

At Aurora Distribution Center - 3M Company we also work to ensure that we are prepared for any accident that might happen. We maintain a written emergency response plan that includes arrangements for immediate response from employees, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas. We conduct regular drills and work with the local Fire Department to ensure the proper execution of our plan. Our emergency response plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt Aurora Distribution Center - 3M Company, we strive to continually improve safety at our facility. Our efforts range from designing safety into our operations to regular assessments identifying opportunities for safety improvements. In addition, Aurora Distribution Center - 3M Company is implementing an updated corporate policy to make safety a part of every employee's responsibility. This policy encourages employees to identify any situations they perceive to be unsafe, as well as any opportunities to improve safety."
