New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n\u00b7 Perform their work in a safe manner, \n\u00b7 Have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\n\u00b7 Are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\n\u00b7 Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,\n\u00b7 Understand and follow site safety rules, and \n\u00b7 Inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with the necessary training prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cincinnati plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

A key element of the plant's protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, plant personnel are prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\nThe plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from local emergency response organizations.    Although these programs have been highly successful - the plant has never had a significant chemical release - efforts are continually being made to improve them.  \n\nThe plant's Risk Management Program (RMP) plan was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP plan describes the incidents that would have the most catastrophic effects (the worst-case release scenarios) and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (alternative release scenarios). Although it is technically infeasible for the worst-case release scenarios described in this plan to occur, the information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to incidents of lesser magnitude, which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using RMP*Comp (Ver 1.06), which was developed by U. S. EPA for accidental chemical release modeling.\n\nCOGNIS CORPORATION\n\nCognis Corporation, which was previously part of Henk"

The Henkel Group has more than 55,000 employees serving in more than 330 companies in 70 nations. \n\nRespect for the environment is a central tenet of Cognis.

Senior management is responsible for release prevention and response programs, and considerable time and resources have been invested in this effort.  \n\nThe plant has detailed procedures to ensure that safety is considered in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of each process.

Part of the plant is located in the City of Cincinnati and part is located in the City of St. Bernard.  The two parts are separated by the Mill Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River.  Fatty acids and fatty alcohols are the major products produced at the Cincinnati plant.  Glycerin, esters and surfactants are also produced.

EPA guidance, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA included both worst-case release scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Considering the design of the regulated processes and the plant's accident prevention programs, it is virtually impossible for the WCSs to occur.  Although it is highly unlikely that the ARSs would ever occur, the ARSs represent release scenarios that are at least somewhat feasible. \n\nThe main objective of the OCA was to determine the furthest distance (called the endpoint distance) at which certain conditions might exist as a result of an accidental chemical release.  Most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences are possible.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nThe WCS for ammonia is a catastrophic failure of a high- pressure receiver, resulting in a release of 19,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period.  Even though numerous controls are in place to prevent such a release and to mitigate its impact, they were not taken into account in evaluating this accidental release scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 milligrams per liter) for this WCS is 1.7 miles.\n\nThe WCS for hydrogen is a catastrophic failure of the liquid hydrogen storage tank, resulting in the release and explosion of 11,000 pounds of hydrogen.  Again, no safety controls or mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the endpoint (1 psi overpressure for a vapor cloud explosion) for this WCS is 0.2 miles.  \n\nThe facility has modern, redundant systems designed to prevent thes"

See the discussion below under GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS for details.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nThe ARS for ammonia is a flange leak in a high pressure transfer line, resulting in a release of 9,500 pounds of liquid ammonia over 19 minutes.  The 19-minute release duration is the approximate time it would take for the liquid level in the system to drop below the level of the flange.  At that point, emergency response personnel could safely enter the area and close a manual valve to completely stop the leak.  Some of the liquid ammonia vaporizes before it can be washed with water into the plant's wastewater treatment facility.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 milligrams per liter) for this ARS is 0.2 miles. \n\nThe ARS for hydrogen is a rupture of the liquid hydrogen delivery line, resulting in a release and explosion of 7,500 pounds of hydrogen.  No mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion is 0.1 miles.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Cincinnati plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.
