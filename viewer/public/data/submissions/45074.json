      "SummaryText": "CF Industries, Inc. is one of North America's largest interregional cooperatives, owned by and serving eight regional farm supply cooperatives.  Through thousands of Member-owned sales outlets, the Company's nitrogen, phosphate, and potash fertilizers reach over one million farmers and ranchers in 48 states and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\n\n\nWhat are fertilizers?\n\nFertilizers are plant nutrients.  Nutrients exist naturally in the earth's soil and atmosphere, and in animal manure.  However, naturally occurring nutrients are not always available in the forms that plants can use.  Therefore, man-made fertilizer is vital to food production.  Man-made and natural fertilizers contain the same ingredients, but man-made fertilizers act more quickly and are less susceptible to weather changes.  Farmers, ranchers, and gardeners add these fertilizers directly to the soil, where they can be absorbed by plants for healthy growth.  Incorporated into a program of best management practices, which includes soil testing, man-made fertilizer use leads to higher crop yields and greater environmental protection.  Man-made fertilizers have made a tremendous difference in farm productivity and the well being of the world's people.\n\n\nCF Industries Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex\n\nCF's Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex is the largest, most modern nitrogen production facility in the United States.  The complex covers over 200 acres, and annual production capacity exceeds 5 million tons.  Highly skilled employees keep the plant running 24 hours a day.  Operating units are shut down periodically to undergo rigorous inspection and maintenance. \n\nThe Donaldsonville facility is unique in its ability to produce world-scale quantities of three major nitrogen fertilizers -- ammonia, urea and nitrogen solutions.  Product storage facilities, rail car loading stations, ammonia pipeline injection stations, and barge and ship loading docks fronting the Mississippi River ensure a steady sup"

      "SummaryText": "ply of nitrogen fertilizers for the farm market.\n\n\nDescription of Manufacturing Units\n\nCF manufactures three nitrogen-based fertilizers at Donaldsonville: anhydrous ammonia, granular urea, and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution.\n\nManufacturing activity at Donaldsonville begins with the production of ammonia.  Ammonia is in turn utilized in the production of urea, nitric acid, and ammonium nitrate.  Urea and ammonium nitrate are combined to form UAN solution.  The complex has four ammonia plants, one urea solution plant, three granular urea plants, three nitric acid plants, two ammonium nitrate neutralizer units, and two UAN blending units.\n\nThe primary RMP regulated substance at the facility is ammonia that is manufactured, shipped as a product, and used as feedstock for other products.  Chlorine is also present in excess of threshold quantities.  Chlorine is used as a biocide in water treatment.  The flammable substances hydrogen and methane also qualify for regulation under the rule.  Hydrogen is produced from natural gas and water in the ammonia process and trace quantities present in by-product carbon dioxide are a concern in the urea process.  Natural gas, which contains 95% methane, is used as feedstock for the ammonia process and as a fuel throughout the facility.\n\n\nEnvironment, Health & Safety Philosophy\n\nIt is the philosophy of CF Industries to conduct its business and operate its facilities in a manner designed to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees.\n\nCF Industries is committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws, rules, and regulations and will promote environmental concern and education among its employees and with the communities in which it operates.  CF Industries is equally committed to protecting the safety and health of its employees, and will take all practical steps to eliminate or reduce the exposure of employees to conditions adversely affecting their safety or health while on the job, and encour"

The Corporation does not hesitate to go beyond legal requirements if, in its prudent judgment, a higher level of performance is in order.\n\nManagement at each facility is directly responsible for the development and implementation of programs and procedures to ensure conformance with this philosophy.  The programs and procedures are continually reviewed and updated, and each facility is periodically audited to assure compliance. \n\nThe people of CF Industries are dedicated to and trained in the safe operation of the Company's production, storage, and distribution facilities.  However, CF Industries' personnel are also trained in key aspects of emergency response. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex is subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards 29 CFR 1910.119.  According to EPA, PSM standards form the basis for the Agency's RMP prevention program component.  When PSM regulations became effective, the facility's various safety, maintenance, equipment inspection, and written procedure programs were adapted to comply with the regulations.  Likewise, a corporate policy regarding environmental, health and safety reviews for changes and hazard analyses for major projects was adapted to comply with the PSM requirement for Process Hazard Analyses (PHA).  The initial PHA and a revalidation for process-related facilities at Donaldsonville are complete.  Facility procedures require an appropriate PHA for process changes to maintain the integrity of the PHA for each area and to facilitate revalidation efforts.  The RMP change of focus from the workplace to potential offsite impact was incorporated into the PHA revalidation effort. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response plan meets the OSHA requirements of 29CFR1910.120(q).

Incident Commanders, Medical First Responders, Hazardous Materials Technicians, Firefighters, Rescue Team Members, Building Wardens, and other support personnel are trained and available.  Facility personnel participate in Community Awareness Emergency Response Committee meetings where representatives of 15 chemical companies and the Ascension Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness formulate, implement, and maintain up-to-date community emergency response plans.  \n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThree incidents have occurred at the facility within the last five years that meet RMP rule requirements for reporting.  One of the incidents involved releases of flammables that caused significant on-site property damage.  Minor on-site injuries were associated with two of the three incidents.  The third incident resulted in one on-site fatality and 10 on-site injuries.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility has a goal of continuous improvement and uses total quality management techniques to define and address issues.  Continued pursuit of the improvement goal is planned to improve safety."
