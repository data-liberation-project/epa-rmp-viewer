The following types of safety features are used in various processes: \n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Survelliance video cameras in sulfur trioxide unloading area, inside storage tank enclosure building, and on .the piping between the storage tank and the reactor.\n2. Pressure relief instruments\n3.  Flow instrumentation \n4.  Area Monitors\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a safe location.\n2. Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases.\n3. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n4. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (i.e. high level, high temperature)\n5. Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (i.e. containment sump)\n6. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n7. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e. uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n8. Atmospheric"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC., Augusta plant has training procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC., Augusta plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.   The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC., Augusta plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team memb"
