      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\r\n\r\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Bushmills Ethanol. Bushmills Ethanol is primarily a producer of fuel ethanol; co-products include dried distillers grains, wet distillers grains, corn syrup, and corn oil. Bushmills Ethanol is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community. Four chemicals stored on site qualify to be covered by the EPA's RMP rule: isopentane, pentane, butane, and neopentane.  All are only contained in the denaturant used to denature the ethanol before shipment off-site.\r\n\r\n1.ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\r\n\r\nBushmills Ethanol is committed to protecting the environment and operating facilities in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel, Bushmills Ethanol has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nIn the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response is described in its emergency action plan. The emergency action plan includes procedures to coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel (i.e., law enforcement, fire, and rescue departments, emergency medical services, hospital and government personnel, etc.) as well as any potentially affected neighbors. In addition, the emergency action plan is used to familiarize local emergency response personnel with the types of material handled and internal emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\n2.FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Bushmills Ethanol facility is a corn-based denatured ethanol fuel producti"

      "SummaryText": "on plant. Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through a continuous fermentation and distillation process.\r\n\r\nRegulated substances stored at the facility include denaturant which is used to denature the ethanol fuel product.  The worst-case scenario assumes complete failure of the denaturant storage tank with no passive mitigation resulting in an instant release of the substance and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion. The resulting impact radius consists of 0.6 miles surrounding the facility, encompassing rural agricultural and eight nearby residences and no environmental receptors.  The alternative release scenario assumed the release of the entire contents of a denaturant delivery tanker truck and resultant pool fire.  The pool fire is expected to have derived from tanker truck failure during delivery with no applied active or passive mitigation (i.e., emergency shutoff or secondary containment dike). The impact radius was calculated as 0.2 miles and does not impact any public or environmental receptors. \r\n\r\n3. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nBushmills Ethanol has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, process safety management (PSM) requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations. The facility complies with PSM for the management of ethanol, fuel additives, and denaturant (natural gasoline). \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nBushmills Ethanol has developed an employee participation program. All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personn"

The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: toxic release, fire, explosion, corrosion, overfilling, equipment failure, and loss of cooling, heating, electricity, and instrument air. The facility utilizes process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, grounding equipment, inhibitor addition, rupture disks, and dikes to prevent or limit releases. Bushmills Ethanol keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility. The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures and Training\r\nBushmills Ethanol maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations, including normal operations, manual operation, regeneration, and emergency shutdown. The facility has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in facility operations.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nThe contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employees follow safe work practices and procedures. The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training. \r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\nBushmills Ethanol conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service."

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nBushmills Ethanol has procedures to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a release of a regulated substance. The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases. Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe facility conducts audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. The audits include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\r\n\r\n4. ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nDuring the previous five years, Bushmills Ethanol has not had any spills of denaturant or denatured ethanol. \r\n\r\n5.

The emergency action plan addresses aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Bushmills Ethanol has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. We work with the local fire department and emergency responders to ensure the proper execution of our plan. The emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\r\n\r\nBushmills Ethanol has a written Emergency Plan on site and communicates annually with the Atwater Fire Department as an awareness exercise. In the event of a release of an RMP covered substance Bushmills Ethanol will notify the Atwater Fire Department, and other emergency response crews as deemed adequate. Contract response services are in place with Pinnacle Engineering.\r\n\r\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Bushmills Ethanol facility has been designed and constructed to meet existing construction and process safety requirements. Bushmills Ethanol will continue to evaluate and implement changes as \r\nnecessary to improve safety at the facility."
