      "SummaryText": "PORT ARTHUR:   TERMINAL FACILITY\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, operates a synthetic organic chemical manufacturing plant in Port Arthur, Texas.  Port Arthur is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC.  The two members of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC are Chevron Corporation and ConocoPhillips Petroleum Company.  Both Chevron and ConocoPhillips are international petroleum and chemical companies.\n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal consists of a Dock & Storage facility and under normal operating conditions may contain one, or up to all three of the following RMP regulated flammable substances, (Propylene / Propane, Natural Gasoline, and Naphtha) above the RMP TQ, at any given time.  These three regulated substances are mixtures.  The Propylene / Propane mixture is a feedstock that is received by barge and stored in bullets and subsequently transferred via pipeline to other Chevron Phillips manufacturing plants.  Natural Gasoline and Naphtha are brought in by pipeline and stored in the C-6 / C-16 tanks as feedstock for other CPChem manufacturing plants.  Under normal operation, the Terminal Dock site allows for the unloading of barges.  However, under emergency conditions it is possible to load the regulated substance (1,3 Butadiene), via barge, which is then subsequently shipped out.  The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit and are remotely located from the CPChem manufacturing main plant.  This RMP only covers the Port Arthur Terminal facility for the regulated substances (Propylene / Propane, Natural Gasoline, Naphtha, and 1,3 Butadiene).  There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Port Arthur Terminal.  \n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal employs approximately (6) full time equivalent employees.  The facility is managed by M. I. Conway, Plant Manager.  Mr. Michael Huskey, EHS Manager, is responsible for RMP implementation for this"
