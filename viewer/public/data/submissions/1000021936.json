              "Description": "The Port Arthur Terminal consists of a Dock & Storage facility and under normal operating conditions may contain one, or up to all three of the following RMP regulated flammable substances, (Propylene / Propane, Natural Gasoline, and Naphtha) above the RMP TQ, at any given time.  These three regulated substances are mixtures.  There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Port Arthur Terminal.  Under normal operation, the Terminal Dock site allows for the unloading of barges.  However, under emergency conditions it is possible to load the regulated substance (1,3 Butadiene), via barge, which is then subsequently shipped out.  The Terminal Storage site consists of two PP storage bullets, two storage tanks (C-6, C-16), and may receive material by barge, truck, or pipeline.  Naphtha and/or Natural Gasoline may be stored in the C-6 / C-16 tanks as feedstock and Propylene / Propane is stored in the bullets as feedstock.  The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit.  The safeguards and responses for the elements in Section 7, Program 1, are applicable for the regulated flammable substance (Propylene / Propane).  \n\nPer 68.25(2)(ii), a Worst Case Release scenario for (Natural Gasoline) which reflects the greatest potential impact / endpoint distance, has been submitted to represent all of the regulated substances.  Per 68.28(a) the Alternative Release scenario for a Natural Gasoline (pool fire) is submitted to represent all of the flammable substances.  Modeling results for Worst Case Release and Alternative Release scenarios are on file at the plant for all of the regulated substances.  The Port Arthur Terminal is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management and Coast Guard Regulations.",

              "Description": "The Port Arthur Terminal consists of a Dock & Storage facility and under normal operating conditions may contain one, or up to all three of the following RMP regulated flammable substances, (Propylene / Propane, Natural Gasoline, and Naphtha) above the RMP TQ, at any given time.  These three regulated substances are mixtures.  There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Port Arthur Terminal.  Under normal operation, the Terminal Dock site allows for the unloading of barges.  However, under emergency conditions it is possible to load the regulated substance (1,3 Butadiene), via barge, which is then subsequently shipped out.  The Terminal Storage site consists of two PP storage bullets, two storage tanks (C-6, C-16), and may receive material by barge, truck, or pipeline.  Naphtha and/or Natural Gasoline may be stored in the C-6 / C-16 tanks as feedstock and Propylene / Propane is stored in the bullets as feedstock.  The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit.  The safeguards and responses for the elements in Section 7, Program 4, are applicable for the regulated flammable substance (1,3 Butadiene).  \n\nPer 68.25(2)(ii), a Worst Case Release scenario for (Natural Gasoline) which reflects the greatest potential impact / endpoint distance, has been submitted to represent all of the regulated substances.  Per 68.28(a) the Alternative Release scenario for a Natural Gasoline (pool fire) is submitted to represent all of the flammable substances.  Modeling results for Worst Case Release and Alternative Release scenarios are on file at the plant for all of the regulated substances.  The Port Arthur Terminal is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management and Coast Guard Regulations.",

      "SummaryText": "PORT ARTHUR:   TERMINAL FACILITY\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, operates a synthetic organic chemical manufacturing plant in Port Arthur, Texas.  Port Arthur is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC.  The two members of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC are Chevron Corporation and ConocoPhillips Petroleum Company.  Both Chevron and ConocoPhillips are international petroleum and chemical companies.\n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal consists of a Dock & Storage facility and under normal operating conditions may contain one, or up to all three of the following RMP regulated flammable substances, (Propylene / Propane, Natural Gasoline, and Naphtha) above the RMP TQ, at any given time.  These three regulated substances are mixtures.  The Propylene / Propane mixture is a feedstock that is received by barge and stored in bullets and subsequently transferred via pipeline to other Chevron Phillips manufacturing plants.  Natural Gasoline and Naphtha are brought in by pipeline and stored in the C-6 / C-16 tanks as feedstock for other CPChem manufacturing plants.  Under normal operation, the Terminal Dock site allows for the unloading of barges.  However, under emergency conditions it is possible to load the regulated substance (1,3 Butadiene), via barge, which is then subsequently shipped out.  The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit and are remotely located from the CPChem manufacturing main plant.  This RMP only covers the Port Arthur Terminal facility for the regulated substances (Propylene / Propane, Natural Gasoline, Naphtha, and 1,3 Butadiene).  There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Port Arthur Terminal.  \n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal employs approximately (6) full time equivalent employees.  The facility is managed by M. I. Conway, Plant Manager.  Mr. Michael Huskey, EHS Manager, is responsible for RMP implementation for this"

      "SummaryText": " site.  \n\nJefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-835-8757) is the primary organization responsible for coordinating emergency response operations for this area.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is an active member of this organization.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is also a member of Sabine Neches Chiefs Association, a mutual assistance emergency response organization dedicated to providing fire protection and safety management resources to the petrochemical industry of Jefferson County.  In the event of a major release of any hazardous substance or a fire, Chevron Phillips Chemical would coordinate emergency response with these groups as well as the appropriate governmental agencies.  Chevron Phillips Chemical Emergency Response Group would also respond to any event at the Port Arthur Terminal.  The Terminal is covered by emergency procedures and processes from both the main Port Arthur facility as well as its own.  \n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management and Coast Guard regulations and to the best of our knowledge we are in substantial compliance with these regulations.  This facility is also covered by numerous EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulatory requirements designed to limit the impact on the environment and we are in substantial compliance with these regulations.  \n\nWe have had no RMP reportable accidents for any RMP regulated substances in the past 5 years at the Port Arthur Terminal.  \n\nChevron Phillips Chemical is constantly reviewing our plant's physical facilities and operations to maintain a safe place for our employees to work, and to minimize environmental impacts.  Although we have adopted a program of continuous improvement, at this time, we currently have no plans to implement any major changes to our plant design, operating procedures, or safety systems.  The facility continually uses the MOC / PSSR and PHA processes, to implement and evaluate changes to the equipment and chemical p"
