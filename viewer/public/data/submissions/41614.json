      "SummaryText": "Viking Chemical Co., is a distributor of industrial chemicals and lubricants. It is located in a mixed industrial / residential area within the city of Rockford, IL. The only regulated substance exceeding threshold quantity levels onsite is chlorine.\nViking Chemical obtains chlorine from a supplier for resale to end users. Chlorine obtained by Viking Chemical is delivered by the supplier in sealed, capped cylinders. Viking Chemical delivers those same sealed, capped cylinders to customers. Viking Chemical does not use or open the chlorine cylinders.\nViking Chemical personnel are well trained and supervised regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In the event of an uncontained or reportable release personnel are directed to immediately notify appropriate authorities. \nSince Viking Chemical is within the City of Rockford, the first emergency responder is the Rockford Fire Department HazMat unit. Viking Chemical values it's relationship with the Rockford Fire Department and has allowed the use of it's site for training exercises for that department. Annually, Viking Chemical provides information to the Rockford Fire Department regarding not only chlorine but also relating to other portions of it's inventory. In the event of a release of chlorine, in addition to utilizing the services of the Rockford Fire Department HazMat unit Viking Chemical maintains a telephone contact list enabling it to inform neighboring employers of any circumstances. Viking Chemical is an active member of the Winnebago County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and is aware of the public safety measures which would activate in the event of a release.\nIn addition to the foregoing, Viking Chemical has a contractual relationship with Environmental Contractors of Illinois (a regional emergency environmental clean-up contractor) for them to provide services as needed to Viking Chemical."
