The Facility Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of the New Antioch Mill Division are committed to the prevention\nof any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and aqua Ammonia. If an accident should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of release to people and the enviorment.\n\n2. Facility Information\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of ammonia products to local farmers to use as fertiltzer.\nAnhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for direct application to crop land for crop production.\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 56,000 pounds in out one 12,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of one semi-trainer load (38,000 pounds).\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.                                              a.The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank released as gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds which represents the volume of the large storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point ot dispersion to 200 ppm) is .74 miles.\nb. The first alternate release scenario is a release from a break in aa anhydrous ammonia transfer hose while filling a nurse tank. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .30 miles.\nc. The second alternate release scenario is a release of all of the 28% anhydrous in storage. This wound amount to the release of the maximum capicity of the tank (100,000 pounds) into the containment dike due to a corosion coused leak in the tank where it would be held. This releases aquous ammonia would then be pumped into temperary holding tanks. No liquid could be released into the surrounding area"

      "SummaryText": ". Only a small amount of vapor would be released into the atmospher.\n\n4. The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Saftety Requirments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonis, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute , Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6. The emergenvy response program.\n- The facility has:\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nc. A Written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintainence of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\nA yearly inspection is done by the State of Ohio Agriculture Department to check our equipment for any needed maintenence and to check our safety procedures. The most recent inspection resulted in the finding of two excess flow valves on two nurse tanks which were not operating properly. These were replaced as required. No other equipment ar proceedural changes were required at that time."
