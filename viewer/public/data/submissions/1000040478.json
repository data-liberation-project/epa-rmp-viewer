Facility Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe South Charleston Emergency Response System consists of volunteer emergency response teams from Covestro and the host company that work rotating shifts and straight days.  The goal is to have between 3 and 6 emergency squad members always available on shift and this group is supplemented by straight day people, call outs and the South Charleston Fire Department which is located within 1/2 miles of the facility.  The Covestro and host site emergency squad people receive approximately 16 to 24 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  In the case of a significant fire or community impact the South Charleston Fire department would be involved.  The plant also participates in local fire and industrial mutual aid systems through the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC).\r\nCommunity warning sirens are placed in multiple places in the Kanawha Valley and there is one within 1 mile of the plant. \r\n\r\nThe South Charleston Plant host (DOW) maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including:\r\n\r\n*\tProper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures \r\n*\tEvacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\r\n*\tNotification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\r\n*\tPost-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\r\n*\tInspecting, testing, maintaining, and using eme"

Covestro owns the ACN material inside the ACN Railcar(s) once it is loaded into the railcars by the acrylonitrile supplier and exits their facility by purchasing agreement.  CSX delivers the ACN railcar(s) to the Massey Railyard for a typical storage period of 1 to 30 days.  Once CSX places the ACN Railcar(s) in the Massey Railyard, the ACN railcar(s) is no longer under active shipping papers.  Upon request from Covestro and Dow, CSX transfers the ACN Railcar(s) from Massey Railyard, through the CSX railroad property, onto the South Charleston Plant to the Covestro ACN unloading station within the South Charleston Plant.  The South Charleston Plant is owned by Dow and Covestro is a tenant at the facility. Covestro leases part of the South Charleston Plant for its operations and stores 1 to 7 ACN railcars at the Massey Railyard during a typical month.  The DOW Massey Yard is not covered under the PSM Regulations.   Massey Yard is not a process and is a normally unoccupied remote facility. There are no Covestro or DOW employees located at the DOW Massey Railyard.  \r\n\r\nIn summary the Covestro portion of DOW Massey Railyard has one (1) RMP listed toxic chemicals and no flammable chemicals.
