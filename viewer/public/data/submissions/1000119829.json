This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our plant. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Gas Processing Plant (Gas Plant), located at 1800 School Canyon Road in Ventura, California processes raw natural gas from the Ventura oilfield. In this process natural gas liquids (NGL's) are removed from the raw natural gas to meet gas sales specifications. The NGL's are then gravity flowed via regulated O.S.F.M. pipeline to storage vessels at plant 6 approximately 1.5 miles away. The NGL products processed and stored are a Butane/Propane Mix (BP Mix) which are flammable gases liquefied under pressure. Current regulated substance is Flammable Mixture (Butane / Propane Mix) and Propane.\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release incident at the Gas Processing facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank of butane/Propane Mix. The release amount would be 77,000 pounds, which is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.30 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS)"

A release may occur of 70 gallons or 296 pounds per minute for 10 minutes when the facility is attended. The flammable cloud may travel up to 235 feet. \n\nFlammable gas detectors are located throughout the facility, with automatic shutdown after 3 minutes. Manual emergency shutdown buttons are also located in the facility (including propane unloading rack), and firewater monitors may be used by emergency responders. Upon LEL detection, a plant alarm sounds and a notification is sent to all gas operations personnel.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the facility. Since the processes at the Gas Processing plant (Plant 7) facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) they are also subject to Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention plan.\n\nManagement System for RMP and PSM\n\nAera Ventura Operations has developed a management system to define all elements required by the process safety standard and risk management program. The management system defines for each program element the following:\n\n1.\tPurpose and scope of element\n2.\tSpecific procedures\n3.\tResponsible and accountable personnel using a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart\n4.\tVerification and measurement metrics\n5.\tFeedback mechanism\n6.\tDocument locations for applicable documents\n\nThe management system is available for review at either facility.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAera Energy Ventura Operations encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Employees have access to all information created as a part of the LP storage facility (Plant 6) and the Gas Processing plant (Plant 7) accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that is maintained at both facilities and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, Aera Ventura operations utilizes behavior based safety management, an employee directed process to observe and review operations to assure safe behaviors are maintained and unsafe behaviors are corrected with peer feedback and corrective action plans.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Gas Processing facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific personnel within the facilities are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. pressure, tank levels, temperature) in a key process parameter document. The facility ensures that process is maintained within these limits using process controls, and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe Gas Processing facility m"

The information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nAera's Ventura PSM facilities have a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nAera's Ventura plants primarily use the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis in recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. A team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise conducts the analyses. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team\u0092s findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from"

The periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nAera Ventura PSM facilities maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit start up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process, (7) safe upper and lower operating limits, (8) consequence of deviation. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Aera's facilities have implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already\nfamiliar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nAera Energy uses contr"

Because some of the contractors work on or near process equipment, Aera's facilities have procedures in place to ensure contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform gas plant or LPG storage facility personnel of any hazards that they may find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Aera evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor and audit contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations through the internal safety and environmental auditing process.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\nAera PSM facilities conduct a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing equipment into service. The review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention programs are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\nAera's facilities have established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, contro"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a process that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nPersonnel involved in maintenance activities receive training on (1) overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, a multi- disciplinary team reviews whether the deficiency can be corrected or determine alternative mitigation to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nAera's safe work practices are in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) an energy control procedure to ensure the safe isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a Hot Work Permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of"

      "SummaryText": "Change\n\nAera has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. The system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to: (1) ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\nNo incident has occurred at this facility that meets the criteria for incident investigation according to the RMP rule. However, Aera would promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. Such an investigation would be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent future releases. Any incident investigation reports would be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Aera periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both plant and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are\nretained.\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION FEATURES\nThe Gas Processin"

The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at Aera Ventura Operating Area. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Ventura Gas Processing facility has safety features on many processes to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) to reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\nRelease Detection\n\n1.\tHydrocarbon (LEL) gas detectors provide alarms and subsequent actuation of shutdown valves (SDV's)\n2.\tUV/IR Flame Detection\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.\tValves to permit isolation of the process\n2.\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters\n3.\tBerming, curbing, and 2 catch basins to contain liquid releases\n4.\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g. uninterruptible power supply for process control system, generator, process monitoring and actuation capability from gas processing plant)\n5.\tAtmospheric relief devices (vast majority go to flare)\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.\tFirewater loop and 750 gpm fire monitors\n2.\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g. fire resistant clothing, quad monitors)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nFor Ventura\u0092s gas processing facility, there have been no accidental releases from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe facility is a non-responding stationary sou"

Employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances. Only regulated flammable substances (i.e., no regulated toxic substances) are held in a process above the threshold quantity at the facility, and Aera has coordinated response actions with the local fire department (Ventura Fire Department). Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\nAera is not a first responder. During an emergency event, Aera personnel can shut down the regulated processes and isolate or send chemical inventories to flare as appropriate. Aera personnel would request assistance from local emergency response organizations for accidental releases requiring an emergency response.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAera evaluates, and as appropriate, implements changes to improve safety as opportunities are identified in PHAs, compliance audits, or by operating maintenance, or other personnel. Currently, there are no planned changes to the Gas Processing facility or process."
