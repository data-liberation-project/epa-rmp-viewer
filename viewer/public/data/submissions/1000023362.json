The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition Process 1 & 2 components are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\nA-4\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nCalifornia Dairies Inc.'s Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by California Dairies Inc. is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\nKey objectives of California Dairies Inc.'s Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by California Dairies Inc..  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Mechanical Integrity Elements).\n\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases.

California Dairies Inc. certifies operators following completion of operator training and California Dairies Inc.'s confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \n\nSecond, all California Dairies Inc. employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by California Dairies Inc.'s (Management of Change Procedure) \n \nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, California Dairies Inc. has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a California Dairies Inc. Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \n\nFollowing completion of a"

(These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review Elements.)\n\n7) Verification of California Dairies Inc.'s compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by California Dairies Inc. personnel.  California Dairies Inc. has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find.

In addition the plan satisfies the State of California's Injury and Illness Prevention Program requirements CCR Title 8 3203.\nIn California, every employer is required by law to provide a safe and healthful workplace to his/her employees. In accordance with the California Code of Regulations, California Dairies Inc. has an effective written Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP). \nThe IIPP is a written plan that covers the following elements:\n \tManagement commitment/assignment of responsibilities \n \tSafety communications system with employees \n \tSystem for assuring employee compliance with safe work practices \n \tScheduled inspections/evaluation system \n \tAccident investigation \n \tProcedures for correcting unsafe/unhealthy conditions \n \tSafety and health training and instruction \n \tRecordkeeping and documentation \nThe IIPP includes procedures that California Dairies Inc. personnel must put into practice.

The facilities emergency response plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies. \n\nThe facility has coordinated with outside parties through drills and attendance at Ammonia Safety Days. Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency. In addition Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities capabilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release.\n\nDetailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responders and company personnel.  All areas (zones) can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel/contractors are on site.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \n\nThe emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and controls for the system with the release.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches and controls are identified at the facility.  \n\nThe facility will assist outside agencies during large releases of hazardous chemicals.
