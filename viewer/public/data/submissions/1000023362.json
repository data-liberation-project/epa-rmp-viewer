The regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. Finally, both the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Association (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\nSCOPE\nThe EPA RMP regulation requires that an Executive Summary be provided as part of the registration submitted to the EPA. \n\nNote: This summary includes additional information not included in the RMP Submit to assist California Dairies Inc. management, process operators, technicians, contractors plus all involved and affected employees towards safe operation. In addition some of the detail provided within this summary was excluded from the submitted RMP as current public access to this detail could expose the facility and personnel to terrorist or criminal activity.\n\nThese processes do not meet the requirements of Program 1. They are subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.

California Dairies Inc. has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\n\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  California Dairies Inc. interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.

Releases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the Plant Manager and Maintenance, if not on site, for instructions.\n\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment on an ongoing basis and prior to changes. These procedures identify potential sources of release, administrative and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel, registered engineers, refrigeration experts, and certified refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment and administrative procedures and engineering controls.\n\nThere are additional full time Managers and operational employees at this facility in addition to Maintenance that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.  An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks.

The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition Process 1 & 2 components are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\nA-4    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nCalifornia Dairies Inc.'s Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by California Dairies Inc. is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\nKey objectives of California Dairies Inc.'s Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by California Dairies Inc..

(Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \n\nSecond, all California Dairies Inc. employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees.

The facilities emergency response plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies. \n\nThe facility has coordinated with outside parties through drills and attendance at Ammonia Safety Days. Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency. In addition Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities capabilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release.\n\nDetailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responders and company personnel.  All areas (zones) can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel/contractors are on site.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \n\nThe emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and controls for the system with the release.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches and controls are identified at the facility.  \n\nThe facility will assist outside agencies during large releases of hazardous chemicals.
