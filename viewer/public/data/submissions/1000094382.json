      "SummaryText": "Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations High Volume Silanes' Trichlorosilane Process is a trichlorosilane production process.   There are 2 covered processes with anhydrous hydrochloric acid, trichlorosilane and dichlorosilane.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations site is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the LEPC and City of Midland Fire Department which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  Several processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 19 CFR 1910.119.  The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Michigan Operations Site.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations site maintains detailed records of safety information that, among other things, describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design associated with all covered processes.  Numerous types of information are available to supplement safety information, including Safety Data Sheets for materials used on s"

For initial screening and risk evaluation, calculations of Fire and Explosion and Chemical Exposure Indices are performed, and a Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis is conducted.  These methodologies are supplemented when needed with analyses that may include:  What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), Fault Tree Analysis and Safer Technology and Alternative Analysis (STAA).  A team of qualified personnel performs the studies along with experts in engineering and process operations.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the Michigan Operations site maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations site has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations site carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Mainten"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are in place at the Michigan Operations site to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training on the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications of existing processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Michigan Operations Site.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating & maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup, and that all necessary personnel have been trained prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations site conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule and other applicable regulatory requirements are being followed and have been implemented properly.  Audits are conducted using an established schedule for the site.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations site promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a serious release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root causes leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations site operates on the premise that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.

      "SummaryText": "ployees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues, to attend applicable reviews, and to recommend improvements.  Improvements are solicited and implemented as appropriate.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nOn occasion, the Michigan Operations site hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The facility has a strict program for informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes, as well as the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors are also required to inform the facility of any hazards they may introduce or encounter while at the site.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations site has not had any accidents to report as part of the RMP.   \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Operations site maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan documents all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is updated as necessary to reflect any pertinent changes within the processes at the facility that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe facility works with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the facility emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\nEmergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced in order to ensure that it is functioning properly at all times."
