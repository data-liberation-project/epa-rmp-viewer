It is United Dairymen's policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.\n\nAdditionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for United Dairymen and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances: \n\nUnited Dairymen owns and operates a fluid milk processing facility located at 2008 South Hardy Drive in Tempe, Arizona 85282.  Anhydrous ammonia is utilized as the refrigerant in the refrigeration system that supplies process cooling for the fluid milk plant.  \n\nThe ammonia-based refrigeration system at United Dairymen provides direct cooling for the falling film water chillers, cream silos, an instrument air dryer, and the glycol and water chillers.  The largest vessel in the refrigeration system at United Dairymen is the high pressure receiver.  \n\nDuring normal operations, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout each refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities on either system, the system being worked on can be pumped down to evacuate the ammonia from the system and stored the ammonia as a liquid in the receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver (HPR) with its safeguards is 9,981.45 pounds.   \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  The worst case scenario (analyzed using RMP COMP) included of the HPR undergoing a catastrophic release with the toxic endpoint distance of 1.2 miles. The alternative case scenario (analyzed using ALOHA) included breaking of the ammonia transfer hose resulting a 500 lbs liquid ammonia spilling on the ground, the duration of this"

Both incidences have no passive mitigation measures considered.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at United Dairymen to address the anhydrous ammonia system. The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nWritten process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\nAn initial Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) were performed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\nWritten operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and will be reviewed at least annually.\n\nSafe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\n\nEach employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\nWritten mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\nPre-startup safety reviews will be performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\nThorough Compliance Audits will be conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the RMP regulations.\n\nIncident investigation procedures have been established.\n\nA written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation has been developed and implemented.\n\nHot work permits are issued for"

The Vice President of Operations has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nUnited Dairymen has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nUnited Dairymen has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since United Dairymen employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, United Dairymen regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety.  The recent upgrades and expansion of the refrigeration system inherently improved the safety of the system through the replacement of old equipment with new equipment and upgrades to the control system.  No other changes to improve safety are currently planned for the refrigeration system."
