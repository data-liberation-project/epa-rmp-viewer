      "SummaryText": "CARGILL- CITRO PURE, L.P. - FORT PIERCE CITRUS PLANT\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n1. Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Cargill Citro Pure, L.P. Fort Pierce Plant (Cargill Citro Pure) is a citrus processing and storage facility, located in Fort Pierce, St. Lucie County, Florida.  Cargill Citro Pure management requires the facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are used at the plant to freeze concentrate and to chill stored products.  The ammonia is brought into the facility and stored in four (4) storage vessels; three within the Main Refrigeration System and one (1) within the New Refrigeration System.   \n\nThe Cargill Citro Pure facility has an ammonia refrigeration system, which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity. The ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in the machine or compressor room.  The high pressure receiver (HPR) is located inside the compressor room.  The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, capable of holding approximately 11,100 lbs. of ammonia.  This vessel was used to determine the OCA for the Facility.\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is the rupture of the HPR vessel, releasing 11,100 lbs. of ammonia gas over a 10-minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions and using in rural topography, the ammonia gas could travel 1.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the EPA's RMP Comp program.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is a pipe leak at a mitigated release rate of 316 lb./min. from the HPR liquid supply line due to pipe connection failure from worker/human error or corrosion of the pipe.  Under normally expected weather conditions "

      "SummaryText": "and using rural topography, the ammonia gas could travel 1.0 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the EPA's RMP Comp program.\n \n4. Prevention Program\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for its ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this also places the Cargill Citro Pure refrigeration processes in the Program 3 level.  The Cargill Citro Pure facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Cargill Citro Pure facility has developed a program to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.   The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan, which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Cargill Citro Pure facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration processes.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics that work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficie"

Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program development effort receives full support of plant management and involves employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Cargill Citro Pure plant has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years. \n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Cargill Citro Pure Fort Pierce Plant has an Emergency Response Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120(q).   The current plan has been coordinated with the Fort Pierce Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Region #10 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing (772) 221-4060 or 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519."
