      "SummaryText": " temperature. The refrigeration system is a liquid re-circulation system and is designed to operate at with overfeed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw and reciprocating compressors are used in the refrigeration system.\nThe refrigeration system, in the 1985 Engine Room, contains four interconnected sub-systems:\n1. Low temperature system (-21?F @ 3.1 PSIG).\n2. Pilot receiver system (96.3?F @ 185 PSIG).\n3. Condenser system (96.3?F C.T. 78?F W.B.).\n4. Compressor low temperature system (-21?F @ 3.1 PSIG ).\n\nThe refrigeration system, in the 1991 Engine Room, contains six interconnected sub-systems:\n1. Low temperature system (-25?F @ 1.3 PSIG).\n2. Medium temperature system (+15?F @ 28.4 PSIG).\n3. Controlled-pressure receiver system (96.3?F @ 185 PSIG).\n4. Condenser system (96.3?F C.T. 78?F W.B.).\n5. Compressor low temperature system (-25?F @ 1.3 PSIG ).\n6. Compressor high temperature system (+15?F @ 28.4 PSIG).\n\nMajor equipment located inside the 1985 Engine Room includes:\n? One low temperature package with two compressors (both FES, 140 Screw Compressors each @ 64 TR/ 143 BHP).\n? One low temperature compressor (FES, 140 Screw Compressor @ 64 TR/ 143 BHP). \n?

FWB).\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\n\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the controlled-pressure receiver (V-2) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling this vessel causing the released quantity to be equal to the total vessel volume with no piping volume included.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios evaluated in this hazard assessment include two possible scenarios. First alternate scenario (OCA-2) is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of sixty minutes. The size of the relea"

The size of this release is based on a ten (10) minute release duration at a release rate calculated from the simplified Bernoulli equation found on page 4-14 in Chapter 4 of the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\" \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for hte RMP. Following is an overview.\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and LEPC.\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; pro"

This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator. Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments. The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.\n\nTraining - All employees are who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\n\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system.

This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.  These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed a"

The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\nEmergency Response Plan - This facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  This plan will be provided to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nCompliance Audits and RMP Revisions - To insure that all the other 12 areas of PSM program are followed, the company requires compliance audits.  At a minimum, these must be completed every three years. Resubmission of the RMP shall be done according to Section 6.2 to meet the OCA requirements.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY - LAST FIVE YEARS\nThere have not been any RMP reportable accidents within the past five years.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nElite Logistics, Inc. recently took over as the operator of this facility. We have reviewed the PSM and RMP programs and are making all necessary revisions. The PHA was recently updated. Recommendations are being addressed."
