      "SummaryText": "Our company strives to maintain a safe and healthy work place.  Our farmer owners, managers and employees have made every effort to plan the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  This company is an agricultural retail business which specializes in grain storage for area producers, as well as providing the necessary inputs for grain production.   Our plant consist of two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, one 30,000 gallons and one 18, 000 gallons, and when filled to 85% capacity will hold approximately 132,000 pounds.   The worst case scenario may potentially release 132,000 pounds (over a ten minute period) and has a distance to endpoint of 2.50 miles.  THis release has the potential to affect 800 area residents.  The alternative release scenario would have a release of 11,908 pounds over a two minutes release period.  This release would have a distance to endpoint of .83 miles and would affect 100 people within the community.   This company maintains and operates their NH3 plant in strict accordance with all federal, state, and local authorities.  The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their request for improvement.  Our employees are trained in safety procedures, proper plant operation, plant maintenance and the employees are competency tested over the training material.  Each employee uses goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of safety water during nurse tank loading operations.    With the above mentioned training in mind, it makes it very simple to report to you that absolutely no injury accidents or property damage have occurred at this facility for the past five years.   Our Emergency Response Plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public, and the area first responders.  This company provides plant tours for out local fire department and out plan has been shared with the county LEPC.  They are aware of the danger"
