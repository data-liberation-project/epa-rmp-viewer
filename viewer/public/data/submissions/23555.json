The Risk Management Program is to be described in an RMP that is registered with the USEPA, submitted to state and local agencies, and made available to the public.  At the Lee Hall facility, chlorine, which is a listed substance, is stored in a quantity greater than its threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds (lbs).\n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G, 68.150 68.190.

Chlorine is stored at the Lee Hall facility as a liquid under pressure in one ton steel cylinders.  These cylinders are stored outside but are used inside of a building.
