      "SummaryText": "Executive summary\n\nIn response to growing public concern over the potential danger from accidental releases of hazardous substances, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was mandated by Section 112(r)(7) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) to establish a regulatory program to prevent serious chemical accidents that may potentially affect public health and the environment.  By adding Section 112(r), which was part of Congress\u0012 response to a series of past chemical accidents with major offsite consequences, the CAAA established a new role for the EPA in chemical accident prevention. \n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared to fulfill the requirements of Section 112(r) of the CAAA pursuant to USEPA regulations contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, Sections 68.1-68.220, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions. These regulations require stationary sources with listed substances present in a process in greater than the threshold quantity to develop and implement a RMP that includes a hazard assessment, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. The RMP must be registered with the USEPA, submitted to appropriate agencies, and made available to the public.  This RMP was prepared by O\u0012Brien & Gere Engineers, Inc. (O\u0012Brien & Gere) on behalf of Lykes Pasco, Inc., (Lykes) Dade City, Florida.  It is pertinent to begin by distinguishing between the Risk Management Program and the Risk Management Plan.  The Plan is the information that the owner or operator will prepare and submit to a central point to be specified by the EPA.  The Program is the system that backs up the Plan and confirms that the plant is being operated safely.  \n \nAnhydrous Ammonia (ammonia), which is a regulated hazardous substances, is handled at the Lykes Pasco facility.  The hazardous properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling the substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat t"

      "SummaryText": "o facility personal and contractors, and to reduce the threat to the community.  At the Lykes facility, ammonia is stored and used in greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs).\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a heat transfer medium in the refrigeration systems that are used in the cold storage rooms, loading dock areas, processing areas and in the aseptic tank farm.  Ammonia is brought into the facility via transport trucks and fed directly into the high pressure receivers of various systems.  Liquefied or gaseous ammonia may pose a health risk if the valves, containers, or lines transferring the ammonia develop leaks or rupture.  The quantity released, release rate, weather conditions, and topography affects the speed and direction of spread of the gas.  Administrative controls at the facility limit the quantity of ammonia stored in the largest high pressure receiver tank to 19,000 pounds (approximately 80%) at an average temperature and pressure of 95 0F and 180 pounds per square inch (psi), respectively. \n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  Based on a review of the applicable regulations,  Prevention Program 3 requirements apply to this facility.  The main focus of the prevention program is to reduce the likelihood of a release by maintaining equipment and training staff and contractors.\n\nThe written RMP was developed based upon a site visit by O\u0012Brien & Gere on September 30, 1998.  During the site visit, ammonia refrigeration system, operating procedures and relevant information were reviewed.  Personnel responsible for environmental activities, emergency planning and coordination, and system operation and maintenance were also interviewed.  A review of the system accident history and the facility Contingency & Spill Reporting Plan  (Contingency Plan) 1997 was also conducted.  If a release does occur, the Contingency Plan, which is already in place, will b"

The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 68 regulations, guidance provided by the USEPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) document and the DEGADIS Model.  The hazard assessment is detailed in Sections II to IV of the Risk Management Plan Data Elements, and in Appendix A.\n\nAn updated RMP, including an updated offsite consequence analysis, prevention programs, and management system, will be submitted within five years of its initial submission or its most recent update.  A compliance audit to certify compliance with the provisions of the RMP regulations will be conducted at least every three years.  A management system is in place to address and implement recommendations related to these hazards."
