Examples of employee participation range from compiling and updating technical information and operating procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis teams.  Employees routinely participate process unit and plant wide safety improvement teams, focusing not only on process safety but also personal safety issues.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Pasadena Chemical plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with our various chemical processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  We primarily use the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.\n\nThese studies are conducted using teams of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  These teams identify and evaluate hazards of the process, as well as accidents prevention and mitigation measures, and make suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  At least every five years, the plant updates and revalidates these hazard analysis results.  Recommendations from these studies are sent to management for evaluation and implementation.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdown.  These procedures are developed and periodically revised by experienced operators, as needed.  Such procedures not only aid in consistent day-to-day operation but also provide a"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and practices that have been developed based on company experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of all hazardous substances.  However, if a release should occur, our trained personnel are ready to respond to control and contain the incident.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Pasadena Plant is located at 1500 North South Street in Pasadena Texas, 77501.  The facility produces linear alpha olefins using ethylene as the major feed stock for the process operations.  The process, which had been in service for over 20 years, was shut down for modifications during the last quarter of 2002 and first quarter of 2003.  The new process produces only linear alpha olefins and no longer manufactures alcohols.   The elimination of alcohol production ended the use of titanium tetrachloride which has therefore been removed from the Risk Management Plan.  The new process reacts ethylene under high pressure with an aluminum alkyl to form aluminum alkyls containing long, straight hydrocarbon branches of varying molecular weight.  A number of subsequent steps remove and then separate the resulting long chain hydrocarbons into distinct linear alpha olefin products.  These materials are primarily sold to other manufacturers for use in their production processes and shipped by truck, rail, barge, and pipeline.\n\nOur processes use the following chemicals in excess of the threshold quant"
