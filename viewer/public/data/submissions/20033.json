Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRoanoke Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Salem facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden  resulting from accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Marc Raskin, Distribution Maintenance Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as"

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nIn addition to the Plant Safety Program, Roanoke Distribution Center follows these corporate safety guidelines: \n\n     Employee Handbook Plant Safety Rules\n     Kroger Company Contractor Safety Rules\n     Kroger Company Safety Inspection and Abatement Plans\n     Kroger Safety Process Improvement Teams\n     Kroger Emergency Response Guidelines\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nRoanoke Distribution Center is part of Kroger Dedicated Logistics Inc.  The facility is a  warehouse that  stores perishable and frozen food products for assembly and distribution to retail outlets. The facility operates three distinct ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  Of these, only one system contains anhydrous ammonia in excess of the RMP rule threshold of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in this system is approximately 13,500 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the above system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Roanoke Distribution Center facility involves the release of 9,550 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the Low Temperature Recirculator vessel.  This quantity represents the maximum capacity of the recirculator, which is a conservative assumption as under normal operating conditions the maximum level of liquid ammonia in the vessel is approximately 30 percent.  Under worst- case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrig"

Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n         Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pressure relief devices;\n         The system is operated at considerably lower pressures compared to "
