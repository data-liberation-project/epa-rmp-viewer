Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Electra Retail Facility located at 5156 SH 25 N Electra, Texas.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Electra Retail Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Electra Retail Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena has prepared this RMP as a 5-Year update in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.190.  \n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Electra Retail Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and consists of approximately 4.5-acres on which (1) 18,000-gallon storage tank and (39) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks are located.  Ammonia is transported to this facility via commercial carrier and transferred to the storage tank.  The process operations conducted by Helena personnel consist of transferring ammonia from the commercial carrier into the storage tank, and transfer from the storage tank into the nurse tanks.  The ammonia is sold to local farmers for direct application.\n \nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for the ammonia storage process. The worst case scenario release for the Electra Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in (1) 18,000 storage tank was rel"

      "SummaryText": "eased.  The release was modeled as if the storage tank was punctured on the side at (2) meters above the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as an elevated horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 3-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (emergency shut-off and automated shut-off valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\nThe alternative scenario is overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since automatic shut-off valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the severed transfer line.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nA Helena Employee  implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Helena Employee is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Helena Employee is responsible for conducting ammonia process operations in accordance with this RMP and is responsible for the relevant maintenance, training procedures and documentation.  Upon request, Helena will provide a copy of its Risk Management Plan, Contingency Plan, and Operating Procedures to its contractors and auditing agency.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelena Chemical Company\u00bfs Electra Retail Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Electra Retail Facility.\n\nCONCLUSION"
