Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Armstrong Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and pentane.    Armstrong Plant operating technicians also attend a natural gas treating plant located across a two-lane highway from the liquid extraction, fractionation and hydrocarbon liquid storage facilities.  This gas treating plant handles naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures which are exempt from the RMP regulation. Liquid gas condensate is also stored at the location, but is also a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture and is exempt from the RMP regulation.  Ethyl mercaptan is also stored at the facility for tank truck odorizing use, but is kept below the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation. The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.  \n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Armstrong Gas Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmploye"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L L C (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Armstrong Gas Plant located in DeWitt County, Texas is owned by Enterprise Hydrocarbons, LL C and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, L L C.\n\nThe Armstrong Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of a two-train cryogenic natural gas liquid recovery plant and natural gas liquids fractionation equipment.  The natural gas liquid recovery units are designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and are assembled primarily from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components.     Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  The plant processes the gas utilizing a cryogenic turbo expander to remove recoverable natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.  These mixed hydrocarbon liquid streams are fractionated at the Armstrong facility into individual, purified ethane, propane, butane and pentane-plus natural gas liquid streams.  Finished products are residual natural gas from the cryogenic plant and fractionated hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems and, in the case of the propane, mixed butane and pentane-plus liquids, al"
