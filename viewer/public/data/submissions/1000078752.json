LLC Fort Smith\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Cloverleaf are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our excellent safety record. Programs in place cover areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activity is storage and handling of low temperature food products.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Anhydrous Ammonia.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant to maintain the temperature of our warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nMaintaining the refrigeration system properly and ensuring that maintenance is performed in a safe and professional manner is the most critical part of preventing accidental releases. Operating procedures have been implemented to help ensure this is done. \r\n\r\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) standards are also very important in preventing releases. IIAR standards are reviewed to help identify potential problem areas, develop good management practices, and maintain our system in a manner that will provide the safest and most efficient operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance with PSM and RMP regulations is another important step in preventing releases. Cloverleaf strives to meet or exceed all PSM an RMP requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of these programs:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nCloverleaf maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all process.\r\n\r\nProces"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What if methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cloverleaf maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nCloverleaf has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the process are competent in the operating procedures associated with this process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nCloverleaf carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; compressors, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Cloverleaf to manage changes in our process chemical, technology,"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nCloverleaf conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nCloverleaf promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nCloverleaf truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
