ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWe at Pactiv Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of processes involving regulated substances.  Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant has coordinated with local and other emergency response organizations which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic consumer products such as polystyrene foam plates, bowls, food containers.  We have one substance present at our facility that is regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program.  This substance is iso-pentane (2-methyl-butane); and is referenced in this document by the term regulated substance.  The regulated substance at our facility is used as a foaming agent in the production of the polystyrene foam.  Foaming agents are often referred to as blowing agents or expansion agents.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nInformation on worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario can be found in the relevant section of the RMP.

THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard.  In addition, we have processes at our facility that are subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration  (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  We also have an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act.  This facility has received a Star ranking under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) for over 20 years.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nPactiv Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts extensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The approach used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP process.  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations and safety.  The hazard analysis is revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years and when major changes are made to the covered process.  Seismic activity consequences and prevention activities are considered during HAZOP studies.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Pactiv Corporation maintains written operating procedu"
