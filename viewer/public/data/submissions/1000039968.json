The maximum quantity released would be 84,117 pounds, which represents the volume of the two largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .94 miles.\n\nb)    The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a pipe..  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41miles.\n\n\n\n4.
