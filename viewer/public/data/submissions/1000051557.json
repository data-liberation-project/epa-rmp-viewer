The CAPP rule requires covered facilities to complete and submit a risk management plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), and to develop and implement a prevention program that consists of an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, summary of the five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nThe Behr facility stores products in aerosol cans that contain flammable propellants listed as a regulated substances in 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart F.  Based on the maximum storage capacity of the aerosol storage cage at the distribution center, the Behr facility exceeds the applicable threshold of 10,000 lbs of a flammable regulated substance.  Therefore, the facility is subject to the RMP regulations.  Based on the worst case scenario modeled using RMP*Comp, and the accident history of the facility related to the storage of aerosol can products, the facility is subject to the Program 1 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe Behr Distribution Center (Behr facility) is a warehouse operation where products in consumer packaging are received, stored and ultimately shipped to various retail locations.  The Behr facility includes aerosol can storage.  Aerosol cans are stored in a designated area within the Behr facility that is fully enclosed with fencing and self-closing doors.  The storage area is equipped with racks and an in-rack sprinkler system that provides water at each level of the racks.  The storage area has a capacity of approximately 50,000 aerosol cans.  The aerosol cans are 13 ounces by weight, and are stored in boxes of either 12 or 24 cans per box.  \n\n\n\nThe aerosol cans contain various spray product"

      "SummaryText": "s.  The products themselves do not contain any RMP toxic or flammable substances; however the propellants added to the cans include the following RMP-regulated substances: propane, butane and isobutane.  Each can may contain up to 60% by weight of a mixture of these flammable substances. \n\n\n\nThe Behr facility meets the Program Level 1 criterion as follows:\n\n\n\n1. The facility has not had a release from the aerosol can storage area in the last five (5) years that reached an off-site receptor. \n\n2. The distance to the endpoint was calculated using inputs assuming the propellant is a maximum of 60% by weight of the contents of a 13 ounce can.  Modeling runs were completed based on a single propellant and a mixture of the three propellants.  The results were the same:  0.006 miles, or approximately 32 feet. The nearest public receptor is approximately 400 feet southwest of the aerosol can storage area. \n\n3. The facility has notified the Florida Division of Emergency Management (the state emergency response commission, or LEPC) and the East Central Florida Regional Planning Council (local emergency planning committee, or LEPC) that it has one or more extremely hazardous substances on-site in an amount greater than the threshold planning quantity. In addition, a copy of the facility's Emergency Business Plan was submitted on November 11, 2014 to the Orlando Fire Department, Orlando Regional Medical Center, Orlando Police and the Office of Emergency Management. Finally, representatives of the Orlando Fire Department have toured the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
