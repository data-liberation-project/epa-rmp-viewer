Consistent with this intent, branch management has proceeded to: (1) Inform employees about the promulgation of OSHA PSM Final Rule, including a general description of the elements contained within it, using currently established communications methods. (2) Access compliance status and develop specific plans to assure that the plant has the provisions of the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule effectively implemented, communicating this to employees as appropriate., (3) Identify operations (processes) covered under the requirements of the rule and communicate these findings to employees., (4) Establish an awareness and understanding among employees about the relevancy and applicability of location safety program elements already established through the Town of Waynesville procedures and operationalsafety program toward meeting the requirements within the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule., (5) Establish mechanisms to make information on covered processes available to employees., (6) Involve employees in compliance with the various elements with the OSHA Process Safety Management bases on their knowledge, skills, and experience., \nThe program elements are process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, compliance audits and mechanisms for access to information.\nAt the Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment Facility, all chemicals are handled in the safest manner possible.     Certain Employees are trained in safe handling of chemicals for the start and are expected to continue to handle these chemicals safely throughout their employment with this facility.

The treated water is disinfected with chlorine and effective Oct.1 2007 Sulfur Dioxide is used as a dechlorinating agent. Chlorine & Sulfur dioxide is the hazardous chemical on the facilities grounds. We store and use approximately 5 one-ton cylinder of chlorine.We store and use 4 one ton cylinders of Sulfur Dioxide.\nThe worst-case scenario was the release of all 5 of the one-ton cylinders. The area affected was 2.8 miles in radius. This would affect shopping malls, schools, homes, creeks, river, and a lake.  The alternative scenario was the release of 1 one-ton cylinder. This release would only effect the population in a 0.8-mile radius. This release would affect a creek, a river, and homes. Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide gas monitors are in place to monitor for leaks. At this facility the alternative release would be a worst-case scenario. This is why we chose this release for our alternative. \nThe Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment facility complies with all OSHA PSM rules. Also, this facility complies with all SARA title III rules. The most important practice in our prevention program is training.\n Also, communication among employees pertaining to hazardous situations, and the immediate steps taken by the employee to fix the hazardous situation.\nThe Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment facility has been accident free for over Twenty years. The Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment facility coordinates with the local fire department and Haywood County's local emergency response commission. Training is conducted using the P.B&S. Emergency Response Training Manual, communication and other sources of information. We are currently updating our PSM plan to include Sulfur Dioxid"
