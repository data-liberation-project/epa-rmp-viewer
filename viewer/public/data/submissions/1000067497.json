      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nSunrise Power Company, LLC utilizes anhydrous ammonia in two identical selective catalytic reduction (SCR) processes for the two gas turbines at their power plant near Fellows, California.  Since each SCR process handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Sunrise Power Company, LLC has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the SCR processes.  \r\n\r\nAs part of the PSM program, Sunrise Power Company, LLC has completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the SCR processes, conducted a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the SCR processes on a daily basis, Sunrise Power Company, LLC has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the SCR processes are maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nSunrise Power Company, LLC emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific and process specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, fire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  \r\n\r\nWhile it is Sunrise Power Company, LLC's objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the power plant precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an Emergency Action Plan has been prepared for the Sunrise Power Company, LLC facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\r\n\r\nSunrise Power Company, LLC is independently audited to evaluate compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  At least every three years, Sunrise Power Company, LLC will audit these p"

The plant is located approximately 3 miles northwest of the community of Fellows, 2.5 miles south of Derby Acres, and 1.3 miles west of Highway 33.  \r\n\r\nThe Sunrise Power Company, LLC power plant produced commercial power for the first time on June 26, 2001 configured as a 320 megawatt simple cycle peaker plant.  Two natural gas fired General Electric Frame 7FA turbines physically coupled to electric generators provided the power during the peak demand period of the California energy crisis in the summer of 2001.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2001, construction began on an expansion of the facility that would convert the simple cycle 320 megawatt peaker plant into a 585 megawatt combined cycle power plant.  The \"Phase II\" expansion included installation of two duct-fired heat recovery steam generators (HSRG) and a 265 megawatt steam turbine generator.  To help control the nitrogen oxide emissions from the gas turbine, each HRSG is equipped with an anhydrous ammonia-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system.  \r\n\r\nIn the SCR process, anhydrous ammonia vapors from the storage tank are injected into the high temperature turbine exhaust ahead of the catalytic reactor.  The high temperature of the exhaust causes the ammonia to dissociate and create a reducing atmosphere before the flue gas enters the catalytic reactor.  This reducing atmosphere in the turbine flue gas helps convert nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and water as the flue gas passes through the catalytic reactor.  The operation of the SCR system substantially lowers the emissions of nitrogen oxides from the gas turbine.\r\n\r\nThe SCR systems at the Sunrise Power Company, LLC facil"

The maximum intended inventory of each anhydrous ammonia storage tank is physically limited to approximately 4,500 gallons through the installation of a overflow stand pipe inside each tank.  The overflow stand pipe is installed on the ammonia delivery vapor return line and limits the capacity of the tank to approximately 85 percent.  If the ammonia delivery truck operator fills the storage tank above 85 percent capacity, the excess ammonia is returned to the delivery truck through the vapor line.  Additionally, each tank is equipped with a level transmitter that will close emergency shutoff valves on the ammonia delivery lines if the tank level exceeds 85 percent.  Limiting the capacity of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank to 85 percent establishes a maximum storage capacity of approximately 22,636 pounds.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 defines the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented at Sunrise Power Company, LLC to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\n- Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\r\n\r\n- Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) have been completed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\r\n\r\n- Written operating procedures have been developed and will be reviewed at least annually.\r\n\r\n- Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemen"
