Our two water filtration plants, drawing from the Potomac and Patuxent rivers, produce an average of 166 million gallons of pure water per day, and over 5000 miles of water mains deliver that product to homes and business in Prince George?s and Montgomery Counties. The Commission operates three reservoirs, with a total capacity of 14 billion gallons to ensure a reliable water supply for all seasons and conditions.\n\nIV. POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nA six member Commission governs WSSC (three for each county). The Commissioners are appointed to four year terms by their respective county executives, and confirmed by their county councils.\n\nThe Commissions power and responsibilities area set forth in state law and in subsequent legislative amendments. The Maryland general assembly conferred these powers upon the WSSC to enable it to fulfill its principal functions.\n\nThe Commissions major functions are to:\n- Provide for the construction, operation and maintenance of water supply and sanitary sewerage systems in Montgomery and Prince George?s Counties;\n- Approve the location of and issue permits for utilities installed in public ways; and\n- Establish water consumption rates, sewerage usage rates, connection charges, front foot benefit charges and permit fees, and if required, cause ad valorem taxes to be levied.\n\nThe Commission also:\n- Reviews preliminary subdivision plots as to suitability of water and sewer design, and review street grades for those streets in which there are Commission facilities;\n- Formulates regulations, issues permits for, and inspects all plumbing and gas fitting installation;\n- Conducts examinations for master and journeyman plumbing and gas fitters and issue licenses to those qualified to perform plumbing and gas fitting work.\n\nV.

The Team Chief serves as Chairman of the Blue Plains Regional Committee, and the Principal Civil Engineer serves as Chairman of the Blue Plains Technical Committee. These committees are charged with administration of the Inter-municipal Agreement, or IMA, which governs regional coordination on Blue Plain issues. The Team Chief also serves as WSSC?s representative on the Council of Government?s Environmental and Public Works Directors Committee (a committee that develops environmental policy recommendations for the Board of Directors), the Montgomery County Water Quality Advisory Group (which advises the council on water policies) and Chairman of the WSSC Plumbing Board (which makes policy recommendations regarding the plumbing code). The Team Chief provides the supervision, management, and administrative control of all water and wastewater groups.\n\nPart of the team?s mission is to provide a reliable supply of high quality water to the WSSC district. In particular, the team is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Commissions watersheds, impounding dams and reservoirs, water filtration plants, and the water distribution system. The Team is also responsible for the maintenance of adequate volume and pressure of water for firefighting and of adequate water pressures at customer taps throughout the bi-county area.\n\nThe Team uses traditional approaches to the treatment of drinking water. Engineering staff is tasked to research and continue to place particular emphasis on addressing low level contaminants. WSSC staff work closely with local and national professional organizations as well as with state and county agencies and the EPA to ensure that, within fiscal constraints, our treatment methods are effective and consistent with current research findings. \n\nVI.

The two plants combine to provide over 120 million gallons a day to the distribution system. Both plants operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a minimum of two operators on every shift. Trained and qualified operators monitor systems and processes to ensure compliance with current EPA water quality standards.\n\nThe Potomac and Patuxent plants have consistently processed water well below the maximum contaminate level (MCL) limits as established by the EPA, Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Based on our records, WSSC?s water filtration plants have qualified for continued participation in the partnership for safe drinking water, a partnership between EPA, water associations, and individual utilities to improve water quality in advance of promulgation of regulations.\n\nPerformance and safety are the hallmarks of our water filtration plants. Both plants have an active and aggressive safety training program. WSSC?s Safety Unit, the plants group leader and chief plant operators provide oversight of staff training. Training is provided in plant operations, accident investigation, accident prevention, and emergency response. Annual training includes CPR, lockout/tagout, Right-To-Know, personal protective equipment, emergency chlorine cylinder repair, confined space entry/rescue retrieval, etc? As a WSSC requisite for long term employment, water plants operators must pass an examination to become certified by the state of Maryland?s Department of the Environment. This ensures that plant operators are fully capable of effectively operating the plant.
