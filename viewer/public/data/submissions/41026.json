The City has reviewed it's obligations under the EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112r of the Clean Air Act ) .  In response to these requirements, the City notes that there are two obligations incumbent on the operations at its facility:\n1.  112r (1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause -  The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/ operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, aqnd to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  The City takes this obligation very seriously, and intends to be not only a good neighbor but also a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness.\n2.  Risk Management plan - The City runs a water treatment facility that stores and uses chlorine in excess of threshholds specified in the RMP Rule.  The purpose of the chlorine water treatment at the water plant is to treat and disinfect municipal potable water.  Chlorine is delivered as compressed gas in one ton cylinders and there are typically four cylinders stored at the water treatment plant at one time.  For planning purposes, the City has considerded the impact of a sudden release of the entire contents of one cylinder within  ten- minute period.  Very conservative (i.e., \"worst case\") assumptions about possible weather conditions and a predictive model indeicate a potential radius of impact of the chemical extending to 1.3 miles.  A consideration of this radius has been incorporated into our notification andemergency response planning.  The City also considered the impact of a more likely release, based on our operational history and most likely hazard analysis.  This analysis suggest that the largest release of chlorine that could realistically be experienced by the facility results in a"

In addition to maintenance, training, and inspection procedures, the City is going to implement an active monitoring and alarm system that will detect a release and engage a local alarmat the water teatment plant site.  The City has coordinated with local emergency personnel, including the Groves Fire Department, and has trained it's own staff to respond to emergencies.\nThe City Management is committed to:\n     Preventing accidents;\n     Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n     Providing leadership to the community with respect to emergency preparedness;\n     Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazrds associated with facility operations;\n     Taking the necessary steps to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n     Being a good corporate citizen of Jefferson County.\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan provides information about the City's management of the risk associated with the chlorine water treatment process, but more importantly stresses the commitment to ensuring a safe operation for employees, visitors, and community."
