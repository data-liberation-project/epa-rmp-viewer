      "SummaryText": "The Central Bi-Products facility, located in Redwood Falls, Minnesota, is a Rendering facility that handles chlorine, which is considered toxic by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to provide a service to the animal and poultry processing facilities by taking non-edible bi-products and processing protein conversion into useful products.  The process includes grinding, fluidizing evaporation and additional processes.  \n\nChlorine is used as an oxidizer in odor control systems within the facility.  Chlorine is widely accepted for these applications.  Chlorine is stored in steel cylinders and is conveyed through a vacuum piping system within the facility to points of use.  If the vacuum system fails, the system automatically shuts down.  \n\nSince chlorine is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, combined with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and safe handling procedures that we use and training of our contractors and personnel.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place at the facility for many years.  This processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nThe chlorine system is set up according to the guidelines and recommendation of the Chlorine Institute.  The cylinders are delivered on a routine basis by a reliable firm and the system as previously mentioned operates on a vacuum system connected to the pressurized tank.  If any damage to the system occurs such that a pipe becomes opened to the atmosphere, the valve at the cylinder automatically closes to pr"

      "SummaryText": "event further release.  \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Redwood Falls Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response.  Representatives of the Redwood Falls Fire Department visit this plant on an annual basis.  \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past 5 years related to the chlorine system.  Furthermore, there have been no reportable releases at this facility in the past 5 years."
