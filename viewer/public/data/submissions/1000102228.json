One way is it can be pumped in through a drum pump which is attached to the mixing vessel pump intake. This is a closed system except where the drum pump goes into the drum. Another way is for adding smaller quantities, a five gallon plastic pail may be filled from the drum spout then poured into the add pot and chased with chemical from the mixing vessel. The pail must be drained completely then can be rinsed with water. Turn on any available ventilation and warn people in the work area who could be affected by fumes. \nWhen handling Formic Acid always wear: \nChemical Apron\nChemical Resistant Gloves\nFull Face Organic Cartridge Respirator\nAdding Methyl Formate\nStep 1\nBefore adding MF (Ecomate) the mixing vessel head space must be purged with nitrogen. This must be repeated anytime the vessel fills with air. Normal procedure will be to have the vessel replenish with nitrogen as it is unloaded so the vessel is always depleted of air. To purge the head space, pressurize the head space with nitrogen to 15 psi (be sure the vessel is rated to handle 15 psi) then blow down. Repeat 3 times.\nStep 2\nMF will be stored in a pressurize tank such as our F6000 or F1000. It should be maintained at 25 psi nitrogen pressure.\nStep 3\nTo add MF to the batch in the mix vessel use the supplied transfer hose. Do not use any other hose unless directed by the engineering department. This hose should have a check valve to keep system from the mixing vessel out of the MF tank. This hose should have a ball valve at both ends so no MF is lost during connecting or disconnecting the hose. The hose should be added under the liquid level of the system in the mixing vessel through the connection on the side of the tank. There should be a grounding cable connecting the MF tank to the mixing vessel while transferring chemica"

An emergency is any disruptive or harmful event that endangers people, environment, or an organization\u2019s property and assets. Emergencies can be small, as in a fire contained by employees using firefighting equipment, or large, as in a disaster resulting from an earthquake or a tornado.  Example emergency events are:\n\u2022\texplosion\n\u2022\toverheated equipment\n\u2022\tairplane crash\n\u2022\tchemical spill in particular area\n\u2022\tfire\n\u2022\tpandemic\n\u2022\tloss of power\n\u2022\tdamage to building\n\u2022\tloss of power\n\u2022\tdamage from chemical spill\nExample sources of emergency or disaster events are:\n\u2022\tsmoking in building\n\u2022\tearthquake\n\u2022\tdisaster in neighboring company facility\n\u2022\tstorm\n\u2022\tdisgruntled employee\n\u2022\tpower generator failure\n\nAn emergency response plan deals with the immediate physical effects of a disaster and is used as an initial response.  The emergency response plan is closely associated with the business continuity plan.  The purpose of the business continuity plan is to ensure a prompt and efficient recovery of essential business operations.\nEmergency Response Policy\nPurpose\nFoam Supplies, Inc. is committed to safeguarding the interests of clients, customers, and vendors in the event of an emergency or business disruption.  Foam Supplies, Inc. has therefore established a comprehensive organization-wide business continuity program to protect staff, safeguard corporate assets and environment, and to ensure continuous availability of its products and services.  To support the business continuity program, Foam Supplies, Inc. recognizes the need for an emergency response capability and provides this emergency response policy as part of the overall organization business continuity program policy.\nScope\nThis emergency response policy a"

The site is situated approximately 5-miles southeast of St. Charles, MO, approximately 20-miles northwest of St. Louis and is along the Missouri River. Methyl formate (Ecomate) is unloaded from a tanker truck into storage tanks that are pressurized with nitrogen. The Methyl formate is fed to a day tank on a batch basis. It is then pumped to an in-line blender where it is blended with polyols and/or isocyanates. The solution is then charged to portable tanks for shipment to customers.\n\nMethyl formate will be stored as a pressurized liquid in two adjacent 4,000-gallon tanks on the back side of the main building. The presence of approximately 230,000 pounds (i.e., greater than 10,000 pounds) of Methyl formate requires compliance with EPA\u2019s RMP rules (Risk Management Program, 40 CFR 68). The pressure in the storage tanks is maintained by pressurized nitrogen. The feed flows from each tank separately to be pumped to an in-line blender where it is blended with polyols and/or isocyanates. This solution is then charged to portable tanks for shipment to customers. Mix tanks are also provided for mixing large batches of a blend at one time for shipment to customers. These are charged from the storage tanks. The blended solutions are used by customers to produce various foam products. A drumming area also provides capability to drum pure Methyl formate for shipment to customers.\n\nThe facility is subject to Program 1 requirements as specified in 40 CFR 68 based on the WCS run on June 10, 2021.
