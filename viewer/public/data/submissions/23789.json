This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and emphasizing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Addis plant is located one mile south of Addis, LA in West Baton Rouge parish.  The plant produces synthetic rubber and liquid oil additives. The plant uses or produces relatively few regulated substances: ethylene, propylene, propane and hydrogen (flammables); and ammonia, and hydrochloric acid (toxic substances).  Of these, ethylene, hydrogen and hydrochloric acid are present only in amounts or concentrations below the EPA RMP threshold quantities, and are therefore exempted.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nNOTE:  Although we have numerous controls to prevent unplanned releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating worst-case scenarios for toxic or flammable substances.  \n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances at the plant is a catastrophic failure of a anhydrous ammonia storage tank, resulting in a release of 4,300 lb of ammonia over a 10-minute period. The maximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 milligram per literfor this WCS is 0.80 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for ammonia is a 1-inch pipe break in the vapor piping,  resulting in a release of 2,800 lb. of ammonia over a 30-m"

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 milligram per liter for this ARS is 0.1 mile.\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances at the plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing propylene.  No administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank; therefore, the full tank inventory of approximately 650,000 lb. is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.7 mile. \n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the plant is a VCE resulting from release of approximately 2,500 lb. of propylene from a \u00bc hole in a transfer line over a period of 30 minutes.  The release is expected to be detected and isolated by the operators within a maximum of 30 minutes (active mitigation). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.11 mile.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Addis plant.   Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Addis plant encourages employees' participation in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant. In addition, the plan"

These initiatives include forming employee process-improvement teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Addis plant has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Employees have access to any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards such as those  associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for applicable process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment to include materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes"

      "SummaryText": "to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Addis plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for the life of the process.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Addis plant will update and revalidate the hazard analysis results at least once every 5 years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates are documented and reviewed with management, and the final resolution is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Addis plant  maintains written procedures that address various modes of proce"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Addis plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training both in safety issues and in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator will work with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After new operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every 3 years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Addis plant routinely employs contractors to work on or near process equipment.  Additional contractor work force is present during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Procedures are in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\nThe Addis plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Addis plant  has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a"

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or Management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Addis plant incorporates quality assurance measures (e.g., purchasing specifications and inspection procedures) into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Addis plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Addis plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Addis plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained on file as supplements to the hazard analysis records for the affected areas, and are reviewed during PHA's and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Addis plant periodically undergoes audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the Addis plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.  In addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Addis plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n-- Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n-- Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n-- Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases\n-- Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n-- Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n-- Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n-- Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control   system,  backup firewater pump)\n-- Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n-- Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n-- Deluge systems for specific equipment\n-- Trained emergency response personnel\n-- Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Addis plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Plant procedures also address the use, maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is reviewed annually and updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Addis plant is coordinated with the West Baton Rouge Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid System (BRAMAS).  The Addis plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations.
