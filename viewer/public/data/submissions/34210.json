Emergency Response Policy\n            It is the policy of Atlas Cold Storage to implement the requirements of the Company's \n            Emergency Response Plan to minimize the risk of an ammonia release.  Company personnel who \n            have been trained in ammonia emergency response are expected to cooperate with other trained \n            responders to protect employees and the surrounding community from harmful exposures to \n            ammonia.  In conjuction with this effort, trained refrigeration operators will comply with all the \n            requirements of the PSM Standard and general good operating practices to prevent a catastrophic \n            release of ammonia.\n\nII.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled at Atlas Cold Storage:  Stationary \n       source: Atlas Cold Storage, Plant 1 230 Collins Road, Jefferson , Wi  53549, Engine rooms 1 \n       and 2.

The general accidental release prevention program consists of the following Process Safety Management elements:\n          1. Employee Participation\n          2.

Furthermore, Atlas Cold Storage is monitored 24 hours a day by ADT Security.  Management personnel, who carry cell phones and 24-hr. pagers, are immediately notified of any refrigeration system failures or alarms.  In this way, system failures can be addressed immediately to prevent a catastrophic situation.  Lastly, each year, and as needed, refrigeration operators are trained on system hazards, operating procedures, emergency response procedures, and other system related issues.  In most cases, this training serves as a refresher for those who work directly with the system.  On-going training helps operators to effectively manage and operate the refrigeration system.\n\nIV.   The five year accident history at Atlas Cold Storage:\n\n      A.  Atlas Cold Storage (as of 6/09/04) in the past five years \n            has not had a leak of the magnitude described in the RMP Standard 68.42(a) and 68.42 (b).\n\nV.  The Ammonia Emergency Response Plan at Atlas Cold Storage:\n\n      A.

Forklift Operation Policy\n                a)  Forklift operators are prohibited from stacking product within 2 feet of ammonia piping in\n                     designated areas.  Other areas are guarded or marked to prevent ammonia pipe impact.  All \n                     forklift operators, employees and temporary workers are properly trained and informed of the \n                     dangers of ammonia.  Also, all operators are evaluated initially, and every 3 years thereafter,\n                     on their skill level.  Any deficiencies noted during their evaluation or course of employment are \n                     addressed immediately with retraining.\n\n          2.  Contractors Policy\n                a)  Contractors are evaluated in terms of their familiarity with the system, their knowledge of \n                      ammonia refrigeration and their safety performance.  All contractors are supervised by \n                      Atlas Cold Storage refrigeration operators and the designated safety contact, to verify their compliance with PSM  \n                      and other safety-related guidlines.  Any refrigeration maintenance needed at L.D. Foods, a \n                      tenant of Atlas Cold Storage is coordinated by the Refrigeration Manager of \n                      Atlas Cold Storage.  L.D.
