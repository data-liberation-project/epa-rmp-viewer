We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nDifluoroethane is used at our facility as a propellant in our aerosol consumer products.  The difluoroethane is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping, vessels, and filling area in our facility.  \n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nChurch & Dwight Company Inc. takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of difluoroethane from the aerosol filling system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms, detectors, and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like propellant leaks.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Plant Engineer is responsible for the management of these difluoroethane safety programs.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates an aerosol filling system with difluoroethane.  Difluoroethane is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Lakewood plant.\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n- Employee Participation Program\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training Program\n- Contractor Safety Program\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n- Hot Work Permit Procedures\n- Man"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no difluoroethane-related accidents at the Lakewood plant in the past five years.\n\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Lakewood plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to difluoroethane spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChurch & Dwight Company Inc. is committed to operating our aerosol filling system in a safe and responsible manner.
