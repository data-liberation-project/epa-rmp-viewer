The Executive Summary provides a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n2. Stationary Source Activities\n3. Regulated Substances Handled\n4. Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n5. Prevention Program\n6. Five-Year Accident History\n7. Emergency Response Program\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n9. Summary\n\nIt is the SCWC policy to comply with the all of the regulatory requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal-ARP). The Holabird Plant has developed a RMP and Cal-ARP Manual that documents the SCWC policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response. Included in the RMP/Cal-ARP Manual is the Management System that includes the applicable operating, maintenance and response procedures, and technical studies such as the Process Hazards Analysis and Offsite Consequence Analysis. \n\nPlant and Process Description\nThe Holabird Plant is located at 631 S. Sorensen (Highway 111) in Calipatria \n\nChlorine gas is used in the process for disinfection of drinking water.\n\nThe purpose of chlorination is to disinfect water that is used by the general public (water facilities). Disinfection involves the addition of chlorine gas to the water to destroy bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that may cause harm to the public health. \n\nThe chlorine gas system at the SCWC facility uses a vacuum regulator installed at the container to reduce the gas to a vacuum. The vacuum is produced by an injector placed in the water flow that draws in the gas. If the vacuum is interrupted, the vacuum regulator will automatically close, thereby greatly enhancing the inherent safety of the system. \n\nChlorine is delivered by a truck from the vendor and is offloaded from the truck to"

The chlorine containers are stored inside the chlorine building. \n\nThe process consists of the following major equipment and facilities:\n\n7 Up to four chlorine containers (2,000 lbs chlorine each)\n7 Vacuum valves\n7 Chlorinators\n7 Injectors\n\nAll chlorine equipment is located within the chlorine building. Plastic tubing delivers the chlorine vapor to the chlorinators. The injector injects the chlorine gas at three locations; one for the water to effluent and two to the pond. A piping and instrument diagram is attached at the end of the PHA (Section C).\n\nThe chlorine building is equipped with a chlorine detector made by Capital Controls. The chlorine detector alarms in the control room and dials out to the service center, which would then page or call the facility. Operator rounds are also made twice a day. \n\nThe operator monitors the following variables:\n\n7 Chlorine flow\n7 Status of chlorinators\n7 Status of chlorine detectors\n7 Chlorine scales\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nIn developing the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), the approach followed the overall guidance provided by EPA in the RMP OCA Guidance (EPA Guidance) document (June 1996). The worst-case release scenario and the alternative cases were evaluated using lookup tables in the American Water Works Association RMP Guidance document. The lookup tables are based on modeling runs using ALOHA and the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Guidance Document.\n\nFor chlorine, the worst-case scenario was defined to be the entire vessel contents over ten minutes with a no passive mitigation. This gave rise to a worst-case release rate of 200 lb/minute and a hazard distance of 3.0 miles (rural). There are approximately 3,371 people within the town of Calipatria (with the worst-case zone) plus a prison population of 4,112  people within the worst-case hazard zone circle around the Holabird Plant. The alternative release scenario was chosen as a release from a 5/8 tubing. This would result in an average rel"

There is an estimated 50 percent of town within the alternate case hazard zone.\n\nImplementation of the Holabird Plant Prevention Program is another important consideration that helps to prevent a release or to minimize the impacts of a release that does occur. Some of the key elements that are incorporated into the Holabird Plant RMP/CalARP Prevention Program are include hazards analysis, training, preventative maintenace, audits, incident investigation, management of equipment changes, operating procedures and control of contractors, to name a few.  These programs are also aligned with the Cal-OSHA requirements as well as the Federal RMP requirements. The prevention program is described in more detail in the Holabird Plant RMP/CalARP Manual Prevention Program section\n\nAccident History\nThe chlorine systems are 10 years old. During the past five years, there have been no accidents related to the chlorine system.\n\nEmergency Response\nThe Holabird Plant emergency response program is described in the Emergency Response Plan for hazardous materials. The plan uses a systematic approach for the response based on the following two incident/emergency levels: \n\nIncidental Release - A minor leak which occurs during normal operation and maintenance activities. \nSuch leaks can occur from a faulty gasket setting, a container valve packing gland problem, or a valve that is not seated properly. With this level of incident an operator or maintenance technician would be on hand to attend to the leak. Incidental releases are those that can be stopped quickly with routine O&M actions such as closing a valve or tightening a connection. For this reason, incidental releases are called controlled releases.\n\nEmergency Release - An uncontrolled leak that occurs within the chlorine system. \nA emergency release is an uncontrolled release that occurs within the chlorine system. This may occur when no"

      "SummaryText": "staff is in the building, or perhaps when a leak gets out of control. If an operator is present, the appropriate action would be to leave the area and initiate the emergency response plan notifications. \n\nThis plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying response agencies and adjacent businesses, emergency equipment list with maintenance schedule, and also for responding to each release level. The plan also includes first aid procedures for exposures to chlorine.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nNearly all PHA recommendations are currently being implemented prior to submission of this RMP. It is Holabird Plant policy to review operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure applicability. This continuous review process will generate further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operating the chlorine systems. \n\nSummary\nThe design of the Holabird Plant chlorine facilities and the implementation of the Federal RMP and California Accidental Release Prevention Program provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of chlorine at the Holabird Plant are being managed in an appropriate manner. The likelihood of a release is minimized through the Holabird Plant Risk Management Program."
