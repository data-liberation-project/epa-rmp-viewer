This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Ready Pac - Irwindale Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nReady Pac - Irwindale Facility is located at 4401 Foxdale Ave, Irwindale CA, 91706.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the CalARP/EPA RMP/ CalOSHA PSM Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: An alternative release scenario was modeled. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the CalARP/EPA RMP/ CalOSHA PSM Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Ready Pac - Irwindale Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of t"

Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n?Well-designed Relief System\n\n?Safety Showers/Eyewash Stations\n\n?Gas Detection\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Ready Pac - Irwindale Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n\n\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 49,347 lbs. Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 10,000 lbs threshold for EPA RMP and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities and over the 500 lbs state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to RMP Program Level 3.\n\n\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n?Process Safety Information (PSI)\n\n?Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n?Operating Procedures (OP)\n\n?Training (TRN)\n\n?Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\n?Management of Change (MOC)\n\n?Pre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\n?Compliance Audits (CA)\n\n?Incident Investigation (II)\n\n?Employee Participation (EP)\n\n?Hot Work Permit (HWP)\n\n?Contractors (CON)\n\n?Emergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of ammonia at the Facility in the past five years, as June 2011.\n\n\n\nEme"
