Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\r\n\u00bfWell-designed Relief System\r\n\u00bfSafety Showers/Eyewash Stations\r\n\u00bfGas Detection\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \r\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Ready Pac - Irwindale Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\r\n\r\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 49,347 lbs. Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 10,000 lbs threshold for EPA RMP and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities and over the 500 lbs state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.
