The ethanol produced from this facility is made by processing corn to produce ethanol.  There are two corn silos with two hammer mills grinding corn for the process. There are fermentation tanks, chemical tanks, denaturant tank, rust inhibitor tank and ethanol storage tanks.  The chemical tanks consist of on 50% caustic soda tank, one sulfuric acid tank, one less than 20% aqueous ammonia tank.  This facility loads railroad tank cars and semi-truck tankers.  \n\n\n\nSome but not all of the mechanical safety systems are: a 30000 gallon deluge water fire suppression system (this system will completely deluge the distillation area 1600).  This facility contains a fire alarm system that uses heat sensors in the process as well as heat sensors mounted outside and elevated on different structures to cover distillation where the ethanol is of higher concentration in the system.  Fire hydrants are located through the facility to ensure the Fire Department ability to respond to any fire location in the plant.\n\n\n\nThe production system is equipped with interlocks in the software system to prevent over pressurization, high temps, high voltage, low flow and high flow.  In the raw product side the system is equipped with heat sensors and voltage sensors on all conveyors to watch for plugged or stalled operation.\n\n\n\nThere is also a simple fire alarm system that can be manually activated.  The fire alarm system itself requires data input to any alarm that has triggered before it can be reset.  The master panel to this alarm system is located in the operations room which has 24 hour occupancy when the production system is running.  This fire alarm notifies the plant operations room, allowing for the plant operator to call 911 if deemed necessary.  This service is operated 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  The fire system is tested by Continental every 6 months.\n\n\n\nIn the tank f"

These fire gate valves have a temperature activated disk that closes the valve in the event of high ambient temperature.  All tanks have the contents properly marked as to fire, health, reactivity and toxicity.\n\n\n\nThis facility keeps all Safety Data Sheets and makes them available to any employee, visitor and agency required.\n\n\n\nChief will have a periodic mock fire/catastrophic event evacuation drill.  This drill will be scheduled by the PSM Committee. The Lexington Volunteer Fire Department and the Dawson County Local Emergency Planning Commission will be invited to attend and/or be a part of the exercise. \n\n\n\nChief Risk Management Program consists of an employee involved systems approach to risk reduction, risk management and risk removal.  Each of the goals of the safety process will be implemented and overseen by the Process Safety Management (PSM) Committee. This PSM Committee will be in charge of the monitoring process of the Process Safety Management system as well as the progress of the safety systems.\n\n\n\nThe PSM Committee will report all its activities and findings to the Plant Manager and the General Manager.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response policy of Chief is as follows: We will depend on the Lexington Volunteer Fire Department for responding to all catastrophic events.  Chief employees will only take the measures needed to ensure personal safe evacuation of the facility.  We will have no Hazmat Response Team or Fire Brigade. \n\n\n\nAny accidental release of any reportable quantity of any hazardous substance will be reported immediately to the appropriate agencies or in the event of plant evacuation as soon as it can be done safely.\n\n\n\nAll release incidents regardless of  will be reviewed by the Management team and if needed submitted to PSM Committee as an incident report.
