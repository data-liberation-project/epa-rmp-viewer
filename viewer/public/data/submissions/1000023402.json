      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nWe at Tate & Lyle Sagamore are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of modified starches for food and industrial use. We have two regulated substances at our facility. These substances include Propylene Oxide [oxirane, -methyl] and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous). Propylene Oxide is used for starch product substitution in the manufacture of modified starches for industrial and food applications. Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is used to control microbial growth during the corn steeping process and also weakens the starch-gluten bonds so the separation process following steeping is more efficient.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Propylene Oxide at our facility is 368,756 lb which is the sum of the maximum bulk tank capacity of 202,522 lb and the railcar capacity of 166,234 lb. The maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide at our facility is 77,034 lb. \r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30 Standard, applicable ANSI standards and ASME standards for pressure vessels. All chemical storage systems were designed and are maintained in conformance with chemical supplier recommendations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention progra"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What If Scenario\"/checklist combination. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA review for the Sulfur Dioxide system and Propylene Oxide system was performed 2/7/2013. \r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES- For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Tate & Lyle Sagamore maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a maintenance shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTRAINING- Tate & Lyle Sagamore has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided as needed. \r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY- Tate & Lyle Sagamore carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance prac"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE- Written procedures are in place at Tate & Lyle Sagamore to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed in 4/7/2014. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job task are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS- Tate & Lyle Sagamore receives corporate audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM rule are being implemented the most recent compliance audit was conducted 11/14/2017. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective action required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION- Tate & Lyle Sagamore promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION- Tate & Lyle Sagamore truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazards analysis.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS- Our company hires contractors to conduct specialized and routine maintenance and construction activ"

      "SummaryText": "ities. Long term relationships have been established with the contractors that work on a routine basis. All contract personnel are required to have site specific training. The contractor training must be documented before a contract worker is allowed on the job site. The contractor safety representative meets with a Tate & Lyle Sagamore representative regularly. The contractor notifies Tate & Lyle Sagamore about any incident that results in a near miss, accident, or injury of contract personnel. Tate & Lyle Sagamore keeps copies of the entire meeting notes and incident investigation reports to document past safety performance. Tate & Lyle Sagamore has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nTate & Lyle Sagamore has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nTate & Lyle Sagamore carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nTippecanoe County Emergency Planning Committee is the Local Emergency Planning Committee with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified."
