It is Sunrise Growers - Oxnard 2's policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; the facility will implement the Emergency Action Plan and contact appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Sunrise Growers - Oxnard 2 facility is located at 2640 Sturgis Road in Oxnard, California, which is approximately 1.5 miles south of Highway 101 and 0.2 miles east of Highway 1-Pacific Coast Highway. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of industrial facilities and farming.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of the Sunrise Growers - Oxnard 2 facility is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for fruit and vegetable products. In order to conduct operations, the facility employs two co-located ammonia systems: the System 1 - Cooler system and the System 2 - IQF Freezer system. The System 1 - Cooler system has a maximum charge of 8,100 pounds and the System 2 - IQF Freezer system has a maximum charge of 8,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant, respectively. System 1 and System 2 are considered co-located as the System 2 - IQF Freezer system has a compressor located within the System 1 - Cooler system's engine room.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cooling food products. Typical operating conditions range from 0 - 5 psig on the low pressure side of each system to 130-150 psig on the high side of each system.  \r\n\r\nThe systems at Sunrise Growers - Oxnard 2 were constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations, codes, a"

The Hazard Assessment modeled three scenarios: a worst case release scenario, an alternative case scenario for the System 1 - Cooler system, and an alternative case release scenario for the System 2 - IQF Freezer system.\r\n\r\nSince the previous Hazard Assessment study, there have been no significant changes made to each ammonia refrigeration system.  \r\n\r\nIn order to determine the impacted population around the facility, the potential for exposure to concentrations exceeding the EPA Toxic Endpoint (EPA TE) value was investigated.  For ammonia, the EPA TE concentration for a one hour averaging time is 200 ppm.  The furthest EPA TE distance reached by an ammonia cloud from the facility is 0.70 miles in the worst case scenario where the entire contents of the System 2 - IQF Freezer LTPR-1 Recirculator are released in 10 minutes.  The alternate release scenario is a small hole (0.25) in a pipeline that reaches 0.09 miles from the facility for the System 1 - Cooler System and 0.10 miles from the facility for the System 2 - IQF Freezer system.\r\n\r\nTable 2 displays the estimated residential populations that are at risk of being exposed to concentrations exceeding EPA TE.  The at risk population represents the number of people within the radius of the maximum downwind distance reached by the plume in all wind directions. The population was estimated using 2010 census tract data from CAMEO - MARPLOT Version 5.1.1 Mapping Software.  When calculating population densities for large areas which encompass many tracts, the accuracy is rated as good; however, for small areas that encompass only two or three partial tracts, the population data may be skewe"

      "SummaryText": "d due to the unequal distribution within the tract.\r\n\r\nThe EPA requires that facilities also consider Environmental Receptors defined as: areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas.  There were no environmental receptors located within the furthest downwind distance of 0.70 miles.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint in ten (10) minutes. Since the largest vessel in the system, the System 2 - IQF Freezer LTPR-1 Recirculator, can hold the entire ammonia charge for the IQF Freezer System (7,986 pounds), the entire capacity of the vessel is assumed to be released.  \r\n\r\nSince the LTPR-1 unit is located inside, passive mitigation was considered for the worst case release scenario.\r\n\r\nOnly the first 10 minutes of the release for solutions under ambient conditions is required for estimating the off-site consequences, because the toxic component in a solution evaporates fastest during the first few minutes of a spill, when its concentration is highest.  EPA allows a facility to use typical meteorological conditions at the facility.  For the worst case scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and stable conditions (F class stability) were used, to find the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in a rural area.\r\n\r\nThe release rate of ammonia from LTPR-1 to the outside environment in the worst case release scenario is 319 pounds per minute.  \r\n\t\r\nEPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention, March 2009, Figure E-2 and Equation 5 located in Appendix E.3.4-Log Log Equation-Anhydrous Ammonia-Alternate for D Stability, Wind Speed 1.5 meters per second, was used to find the downwind distance for the worst release scenario.

The population receptors that may be affected by this worst case release scenario are listed in Table 3 and shown as the outer pink circle in Figure 2.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Result Summary\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenarios presented are similar to the worst case in that they are liquid releases.  The alternative release scenarios chosen for this facility are those of 0.25 inch diameter orifices in each system leading to airborne releases, representative of a pump seal leak, a gasket rupture, pinhole leak due to corrosion, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, etc.  It is assumed that this release is from the high side of each system; therefore at a maximum pressure of 130 psig for the System 1 - Cooler system and 150 psig for the System 2 - IQF Freezer system.  The release scenarios are assumed to last for approximately 60 minutes each, which considers the refrigeration systems' emergency shutdown capabilities.\r\n\r\nEPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention, March 2009, Figure E-3 and Equation located in Appendix E.3.4-Log Log Equation-Anhydrous Ammonia-Alternate for D Stability, Wind Speed 3.0 Meters per Second, was used to find the downwind distance for the alternate release scenarios.

Much of the safety of the systems are inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems. \r\n\r\nThe PSM / RMP / CalARP program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff is trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia systems.  All pressure vessels in the ammonia systems are equipped with relief valves that vent to the atmosphere at a certain pressure set point. A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are inspected regularly to ensure proper operation.\r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Sunrise Growers - Oxnard 2 facility is a non-responding facility has an emergency action plan (EAP) in effect. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To save lives.\r\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3. To protect the environment.\r\n4. To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is \r\nreviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM / RMP / CalARP regulations.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an ammonia emergency, Sunrise Growers - Oxnard 2 plans to evacuate al"
