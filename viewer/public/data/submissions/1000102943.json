Chlorine detectors are located in storage and system operations rooms for the detection of leaks. These devices are checked and tested quarterly to ensure their performance. When an alarm is set off our Chlorine Scrubber is activated to run to also ensure its operation is working properly. All of this is documented in a service book. If a true alarm is detected the proper procedure is then enacted for employees to follow the steps from and SOP to guide everyone in a safe manner. No accidental releases has occurred in the past 5-years.\n\nTraining and improvement for safety is always ongoing for the Papillion Water Treatment Facility. A potential larger update on the Chlorine Control Room is possibly in order in the next 3 years. This is due to the growing community with a needed expansion and upsizing of injectors. Even if upsizing is not warranted, upgrading the injectors will take place along with the changing of all piping. This will ensure the long life of our equipment and deviate a potential accidental release of Chlorine."

Refresher training is conducted annually with all employees on the SOP\u2019s along with hands on training and demonstration walk-through of how to perform the listed SOP\u2019s. Due to the frequency of Deliveries and Ton Cylinder Changing, these two SOP\u2019s are readily available for employees to refer to at site locations of chlorine cylinders and control rooms for access to reference within reach. The storage/control rooms also includes placards located inside/outside for information and guidance of Chlorine safety and instructions for handling.   Downloaded information is readily available for employees from The Chlorine Institute, Inc. with a variety of information pertaining to Chlorine and other safety information in their Pamphlet form information they provide for refresher training to the employees of the Papillion Water Facility. \n\nThe Critical Information and Emergency Phone Contact List for Public Water Systems, is updated annually and posted for employees for emergency situations for chlorine. A list of numbers and with response sequence is posted for the purpose of ease and safety of employees. Generally a Hazard Review and Compliance Audit is conducted for the facility on odd numbered years, where emergency response teams are invited to our facility for brief walk-throughs and refreshers on the hazards located at out facility including Chlorine along with other chemicals housed at the facility.

      "SummaryText": "OVERVIEW:\nThe Papillion Water Treatment Facility uses 2 separate banks for ton chlorine cylinders. Bank one houses (2) 1-ton spots labeled (1&2) for the make-up of Chlorine Dioxide solution for the treatment of taste/odor issues. Bank two houses (2) 1-ton spots labeled (3&4) for Chlorine Gas Disinfection. Each bank always has a 1-ton cylinder online for disinfection and the other set for taste/odor. Each bank then always has a 1-ton cylinders online for a standby as needed in an automatic transfer when needed. PWTF has (3) 1-ton cylinders on reserve that are not used until as needed and put into circulation once any given ton cylinder is empty. Bank one chlorine gas is sent through an injector and mixed with potable water to make a chlorine solution, mixes with sodium chlorite to make chlorine dioxide solution, which then is used as a pre-chlorination for taste/odor and added to the raw water line or head works. Bank two chlorine gas is sent through an injector mixed with potable water to make a chlorine solution then sent as post chlorination for our primary use of disinfection in the wet well past the filtration process at each set of 4 filter areas. At any time there should be a 30 day supply of chlorine on hand. The chlorine feed system consists of 3 vacuum chlorinators and 3 injectors supplied with potable water. There should never be more than one 1-ton chlorine cylinder in STANDBY or ONLINE for each bank of chlorine cylinders at one time to minimize hazards and failure potentials. Chlorine system start-up should require less than 30 minutes to complete if a bank of cylinders are connected and in STANDBY.\n\nStandard Operation Procedures:\n\nA Risk Management Plant outline has a binder book located by control system (SCADA). This book included guided summaries and SOP for the dealing with the Chlorine system operations for the City of Papillion\u2019s Water Treatment Facility. SOP\u2019s listed in book include:\n\nChlorine Start-up Operations\nChlorine Shutdown Operations\nChlo"
