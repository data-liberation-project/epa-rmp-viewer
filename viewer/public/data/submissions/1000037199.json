The site doubled its manufacturing capacity between 1997 and 2001 with Covestro's largest-ever capital expansion ($1.4 billion). Known today as an industrial park, approximately 35% of the Covestro acreage is developed.  Covestro hosts three guest facilities (Momentive, El Dorado Nitrogen and Texas Brine) to provide raw materials for the facility and one energy center (Calpine Corporation) to produce steam and electricity for the entire complex.\r\nThe site is serviced by barge, rail, and truck as well as pipeline service to and from industry along the Houston Ship Channel region.\r\nPrimarily supporting the automotive and construction industries, products manufactured by Covestro Baytown include: \r\n\u00bf\tpolycarbonate thermoplastic (used in CD/DVDs, auto and optical lenses, medical supplies and sports equipment)\r\n\u00bf\traw materials for polyurethane foams (used in home and appliance insulation, cushions, and auto trim) \r\n\u00bf\thigh-performance coatings (used in automotive, wood, flooring and furniture coatings) \r\n\u00bf\tbasic inorganic chemical products, such as chlorine, hydrochloric acid,  and caustic, to be used as raw materials in our other processes, and for products for industry\r\n\r\nRisk Management Program (RMP)\r\nCovestro Baytown has seven processes covered under RMP.  The management team at Covestro Baytown has designated the site as a Process Safety Management site.
