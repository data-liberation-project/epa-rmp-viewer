The site doubled its manufacturing capacity between 1997 and 2001 with Covestro's largest-ever capital expansion ($1.4 billion). Known today as an industrial park, approximately 35% of the Covestro acreage is developed.  Covestro hosts three guest facilities (Momentive, El Dorado Nitrogen and Texas Brine) to provide raw materials for the facility and one energy center (Calpine Corporation) to produce steam and electricity for the entire complex.\n\nThe site is serviced by barge, rail, and truck as well as pipeline service to and from industry along the Houston Ship Channel region.\n\nPrimarily supporting the automotive and construction industries, products manufactured by Covestro Baytown include: \n\n?    polycarbonate thermoplastic (used in CD/DVDs, auto and optical lenses, medical supplies and sports equipment)\n\n?    raw materials for polyurethane foams (used in home and appliance insulation, cushions, and auto trim) \n\n?    high-performance coatings (used in automotive, wood, flooring and furniture coatings) \n\n?    basic inorganic chemical products, such as chlorine, hydrochloric acid,  and caustic, to be used as raw materials in our other processes, and for products for industry\n\n\n\nRisk Management Program (RMP)\n\nCovestro Baytown has seven processes covered under RMP.  The management team at Covestro Baytown has designated the site as a Process Safety Management site.  All processes are covered at the full PSM level and are considered to be Program Level III processes under the scope of Risk Management.\n\nThere are six chemicals used in quantities greater than the threshold quantities as defined in the RMP regulations:\n\n?    Ammonia\n\n?    Chlorine\n\n?    Formaldehyde solution (37%)\n\n?    Phosgene\n\n?    Toluene Diisocyanate (mixed isomer form).\n\n?    HCl (Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride c"

PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) is intended to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. The PSM elements are:\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nEmployees participate on numerous safety steering committees that potentially affect the work life of each area at the Covestro Baytown site.  Action items identified from inspections, incidents, process hazards analyses, etc. are provided to employees for review.  \n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nAll site personnel have access to the company's electronic mail system and Intranet.  Chemical-specific information (Material Safety Data Sheets), operating information, and information on the equipment in the process are easily accessible.  The information resides in a controlled electronic system that is updated regularly.  All Process Safety Information (PSI) is verified at each scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\n\nEvery five years, process hazards analyses (PHA's) are conducted in each process unit.  The HazOp method is used to conduct PHA's.  Findings are identified, prioritized, and then promptly corrected.  The information is shared with personnel who are impacted by the findings.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic follow up, tracking, and closure system.  Improvements in process control systems and safeguards are outcomes of the PHA process.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nOperating procedures addressing normal and abnormal operating situations are in place and implemented.  Deviations from established operating limits and the consequences of these deviations are clearly identified and easily referenced.   The procedures are reviewe"

A contractor safety steering committee and the site-wide safety council actively monitors the actions of contractors to assure their safety, the safety of the Covestro facility and its employees is maintained. Contract employees are required to participate annually in comprehensive industry safety training. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\n\nReviews are conducted of any new facility, major modification, or a change (management of change) before the new system can become operational.  Findings are addressed prior to startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nMechanical integrity procedures are in place to ensure maintenance workers understand how to perform their duties safely to maintain the facility.  Specific instructions for testing and inspections are included.  Testing and inspections are conducted as scheduled and documented.  Maintenance and engineering follow established codes, standards and company guidelines.\n\nHot Work and Control of Abnormal Activities:\n\nControl of hot work and non-normal situations is conducted to ensure work does not contribute to or cause hazardous results.  All aspects of hot work and abnormal situations are controlled.
