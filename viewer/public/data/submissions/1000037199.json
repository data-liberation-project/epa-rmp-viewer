Our employees strive for safety, health, and environmental excellence in all aspects of Covestro's activities while meeting our business objectives.\n\nWithout exception, every Covestro employee is responsible for working safely.  Safety is the top responsibility at all levels of management and supervision.   Managers and supervisors are expected to set an example with their own behavior.  The design, operation, maintenance, and regular inspections of Covestro facilities safeguard employees and the public.  Covestro works to make its operations safer by continually improving safety and health measures.\n\n\n\nThe Corporate Policy on Health, Safety, Environment and Quality states:\n\n\"At Covestro, it is our core belief that safety, environmental protection, product and process quality and commercial efficiency are factors of equal importance in achieving our corporate objectives. Consequently, we respect and support the objectives of Responsible Care and Sustainable Development as a commitment for management and as a responsibility shared by each employee.\"\n\nEmployees and management have confirmed this dedication through the adoption and implementation of a Code of Conduct which states, among other safety objectives, \"Code of Conduct is my agreement and commitment to keep myself and my coworkers safe and to protect the environment.\"\n\n\"Responsible Care\" is a public commitment to which the Covestro Baytown Industrial Park actively supports as a member of the American Chemical Council.  Responsible Care focuses on continuous improvement of health, safety and environmental performance.\n\nPatrick Thomas, Covestro CEO, stated in a recent talk in Baytown, \"Nothing you do is worth getting hurt for.\"  The talk was broadcast globally to all Covestro"

The site doubled its manufacturing capacity between 1997 and 2001 with Covestro's largest-ever capital expansion ($1.4 billion). Known today as an industrial park, approximately 35% of the Covestro acreage is developed.  Covestro hosts three guest facilities (Momentive, El Dorado Nitrogen and Texas Brine) to provide raw materials for the facility and one energy center (Calpine Corporation) to produce steam and electricity for the entire complex.\n\nThe site is serviced by barge, rail, and truck as well as pipeline service to and from industry along the Houston Ship Channel region.\n\nPrimarily supporting the automotive and construction industries, products manufactured by Covestro Baytown include: \n\n?    polycarbonate thermoplastic (used in CD/DVDs, auto and optical lenses, medical supplies and sports equipment)\n\n?    raw materials for polyurethane foams (used in home and appliance insulation, cushions, and auto trim) \n\n?    high-performance coatings (used in automotive, wood, flooring and furniture coatings) \n\n?    basic inorganic chemical products, such as chlorine, hydrochloric acid,  and caustic, to be used as raw materials in our other processes, and for products for industry\n\n\n\nRisk Management Program (RMP)\n\nCovestro Baytown has seven processes covered under RMP.  The management team at Covestro Baytown has designated the site as a Process Safety Management site.  All processes are covered at the full PSM level and are considered to be Program Level III processes under the scope of Risk Management.\n\nThere are six chemicals used in quantities greater than the threshold quantities as defined in the RMP regulations:\n\n?

Action items identified from inspections, incidents, process hazards analyses, etc. are provided to employees for review.  \n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nAll site personnel have access to the company's electronic mail system and Intranet.  Chemical-specific information (Material Safety Data Sheets), operating information, and information on the equipment in the process are easily accessible.  The information resides in a controlled electronic system that is updated regularly.  All Process Safety Information (PSI) is verified at each scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\n\nEvery five years, process hazards analyses (PHA's) are conducted in each process unit.  The HazOp method is used to conduct PHA's.  Findings are identified, prioritized, and then promptly corrected.  The information is shared with personnel who are impacted by the findings.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic follow up, tracking, and closure system.  Improvements in process control systems and safeguards are outcomes of the PHA process.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nOperating procedures addressing normal and abnormal operating situations are in place and implemented.

A contractor safety steering committee and the site-wide safety council actively monitors the actions of contractors to assure their safety, the safety of the Covestro facility and its employees is maintained. Contract employees are required to participate annually in comprehensive industry safety training. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\n\nReviews are conducted of any new facility, major modification, or a change (management of change) before the new system can become operational.  Findings are addressed prior to startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nMechanical integrity procedures are in place to ensure maintenance workers understand how to perform their duties safely to maintain the facility.
