The alternative release scenario is a release that is considered more reasonable or more likely. These maximum distances are used to determine the radii for circles around the covered processes.\r\n\r\nResidential populations within these circles are required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this RMP submittal. These estimates were acquired from the EPA Marplot software.  Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to an individual release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not taken into account. Generally, the Stockton Plant components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance with regulatory requirements.  \r\n\r\nThe plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide program documentation includes the following PSM elements: process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; mechanical integrity; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; and emergency planning and response.

Furthermore, the EHSS Manager is actively involved in emergency planning with community emergency management and response stakeholders including participation on the California Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Board.
