(Agriform), Woodland Facility (Facility) at 1000 North East Street (40189 County Road 18C), Woodland, California, 95776 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Consolidated Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in Northern California.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, converted, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck or railcar and stored in either an 18,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) or a 22,440-gallon storage tank. The railcar has a volume of 38,887 gallons. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 346,580 pounds.  Aqua ammonia is produced from anhydrous ammonia and stored in a 450,000-gallon storage tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 3,291,750 pounds.\n    \n3.    THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank (railcar) when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 169,898 pounds of anhydrous ammonia; this represents the volume of the largest storage tank limited at 85% of capacity.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or"

Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 3,291,750 pounds of aqua ammonia that forms a liquid pool restricted in area by the perimeter of the facility.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a pipe break modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters. \n\n4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\n\nSafety Information:  Agriform ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees.  The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on July 21, 2009.\n\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the ammonia processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on May 3, 2010.  Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The operating procedures were last revised in March 2009.\n\nTraining:  The Agriform Facility staff, as well as The Tremont Group, Inc. (Tremont) corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.  The training program was last rev"

Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\nA?    Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\nA?    Training records for each employee.\n\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspections were conducted in April 2010 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted in January 2010.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years.  Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on May 3 and 6, 2010.\n\nIncident Investigation:  An incident involving a regulated substance occurred at the Facility in December 2008 and the incident investigation was completed on December 15, 2008.  The changes resulting from the incident investigation were completed in August 2009.\n\nIn addition to the prevention program elements described above, the following chemical-specific prevention steps have been implemented.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility implements the provisions of the A?Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, A?Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety OrdersA?; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, A?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.A?\n\n5.

      "SummaryText": "TORY\nOn December 11, 2008 at 8:30am during the initial start-up of the redesigned ammonium polyphosphate reactor, an anhydrous ammonia valve was accidentally opened out of sequence introducing excess ammonia in the product sump before reaching normal operating temperature which did not allow full reaction of the ammonia input. The operator recognized that the operating temperature began decreasing and shut down the reactor after running in that state for less than 2 minutes.  An unknown quantity of ammonia was released with steam from the reactor.  Weather conditions compounded the problem with a cold inversion layer trapping the steam and forcing the release to ground level.    \n\nThe Woodland Fire Department notified Agriform of an ammonia odor in neighboring businesses.  While Agriform employees were determining the origin of the ammonia odor, the Yolo County Environmental Health Department contacted Agriform regarding the offsite migration of the ammonia odor.  Several employees at two neighboring businesses were checked by the Woodland Fire Department and two were sent to the hospital for further examination.  The employees sent to the hospital were checked, released, and returned to work.\n  \nA corrective action program was implemented that included an ammonia restrictor plate, repositioning of valves, and revision to operating procedures to include a comprehensive pre-startup checklist.  In addition, an automatic control system that interlocks various flow switches and temperature sensors to the main shutoff valve on the anhydrous ammonia supply line has been installed.  \n\n6.    THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facilityA?s emergency response program is developed in accordance with Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code, Hazardous Materials Business Plan requirements.  The Consolidated Contingency Plan was most recently updated on March 31, 2010 and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n"
