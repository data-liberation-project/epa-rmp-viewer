      "SummaryText": "Joe Bodiford Farms has operated a farm in Sylvania, Georgia for the past 24 years. Our anhydrous ammonia tank is used solely for crop production on the farm and not resold to others.   We have a comprehensive emergency response plan and an accident prevention program in place at our facility.  In response to the new RMP program, we are in the process of cooperating with public emergency planning agencies to develop and maintain contingency plans in case of an accidental release.  All of our employees attend annual procedural safety and emergency response classes.  This policy has allowed us to remain accident free for more than five years.\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia tank farm is inspected on a regular basis to ensure safe reliable operation.  The last comprehensive facility inspection was on April 10, 1999. Safety placards are placed  on the tanks, and at the fill station.   The facility's single 12,000 tank is equipped with pressure relief valves and gauges to prevent overpressurization.  The supply lines are equipped with excess flow devices that will automatically shut off the flow in the event of a pipe or transfer hose failure.  The tank and pipes also feature manual shutoff valves to stop and isolate a leak so that it can be repaired.  The facility has a water purging system to clear any extraneous product from the transfer lines after use.  There is a water supply located at the fill station to rinse away any product in case of accidental skin contact.\n\nThe worst case scenario indicate that businesses and residences offsite will be affected in the event of a catastrophic release.  However we believe that our vigorous safety and emergency response programs greatly reduce the likelihood of this scenario from happening.  The alternative case release scenario is a more accurate assessment of risk to the community.  In the Alternate release scenario the toxic endpoint was less than a tenth of a mile and would not breach the borders of the facility."
