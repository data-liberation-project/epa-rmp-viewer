Anhydrous ammonia is utilized at the Griffith Energy facility in the chiller system. Approximately 143,000 pounds of liquid ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the system that enhances gas turbine performance and efficiency during warm weather conditions by cooling the turbine inlet air. The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, evaporators and compressors comprising the chiller system. All equipment used within the chiller system has been designed and constructed under codes and standards regulated by the ammonia refrigeration industry.\n\nChiller System Safety\n\nGriffith Energy is in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and 40 CFR 68, CAA Section 112 EPA Risk Management Program.\n\nIn addition to the required OSHA, EPA and corporate safety programs that will be mandated within the facility, the following engineering and administrative controls will be in place to eliminate, or reduce the possibility of an accidental anhydrous ammonia release at the Griffith Energy facility:\n\n?

Continual vibration analysis of compressors and condenser fan drive shafts is provided to alert maintenance personnel of potential equipment malfunction, or failure.\n?    Ammonia system operators receive system training from outside contractors with extensive knowledge and experience with anhydrous ammonia.\n \nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario depicts a catastrophic failure of the high pressure receiver that is located outside, adjacent to the evaporative condenser and chiller system covered area.\nThe high pressure receiver is capable of holding 115,000 pounds, however administrative controls limit the operating level of the receiver to 50% of the total capacity. \nThe scenario amount that was used for modeling purposes was the 50% capacity, or 57,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The resulting vapor cloud from the release produced a toxic endpoint of 6 miles from the Griffith Energy facility using the meteorological conditions specified by EPA. The endpoint was determined using atmospheric dispersion modeling via ALOHA, (Areal Locations Of Hazardous Atmospheres). In comparison, the EPA's RMP Comp was also used for modeling. RMP Comp yielded a more conservative 3.7 miles to the toxic endpoint. \n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario\n\nThe alternate case scenario involves an over pressure condition in the flash economizer.

Procedures have been developed for: 1) pre-emergency planning and coordination; 2) personnel roles and lines of authority; 3) training; 4) communication; 5) emergency recognition and prevention; 6) safe distances and places of refuge; 7) site security and control; 8) emergency alerting and response; 9) personal protective and emergency equipment; and 10) medical surveillance. All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Kingman Fire Department would be called to provide assistance."
