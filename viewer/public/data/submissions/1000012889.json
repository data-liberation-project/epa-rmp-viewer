This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. The company policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAGE Refining Inc. operates three regulated flammable substance processes, (e.g., propane, butane, Liquid Petroleum Gas) from raw crude oil.  The threshold planning quantities defined in 40 CFR 68.130 are exceeded for Propane, Isobutane, Butane and Isopentane, Methane, Ethane, and Pentane.  This is based on the actual maximum inventory and the composition of the Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) in Tank 900-01 and Tank 900-03\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the LPG storage Tank 900-03. Tank 900-03 has a capacity of 658 barrels (36,190 gallons) of LPG and the full inventory of the tank is assumed to be released, completely vaporized, and ignited, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this tank is 0.5 miles from the storage site. No credit for passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. Note that the relief valve for this tank is piped to the plant emergency flare. The flare will act as a safety device in the event of an unanticipated release. This tank will also have an automated deluge fire suppressant system per NFPA requirements, designed by North Star Fi"

This would result in the release of 36,190 gallons of LPG.  The predominate winds are from the southwest to northeast. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this alternative scenario with a successive explosion would be 0.4 miles from the source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery. Because processes at the refinery are subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAGE Refining Inc., has established a Process Safety Management Committee (PSMC) consisting of employees from all operational facets to review, evaluate and make recommendations to management on the safe operation of the plant processes. The company also encourages employees to participate in the plants safety and loss control program. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery safety and accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nAGE Refining Inc., keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The refinery ensures the process is maintained within design limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, and experienced personnel.\n\nThe Process Safety Management study determined and documented that the refinery's existing equipment was designed and constructed in accordance with codes, standards and practices no longer in general use; however, the plant is being operated within the parameters previously established to ensure the safety of the personnel and the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nAGE Refining Inc., does not have the threshold quantities of Regulated Toxic Substances required under the Environmental Protection Agency?s Rule 40 CFR 68.130, however the plant does have the threshold planning quantities of  Flammable Substances.  AGE Refining Inc. does not  have threshold quantities of the Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Toxins or Reactives as defined by Appendix A of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration' Standard 29 CFR 1910.119; however, AGE Refining Inc. has performed a process hazard analysis that has identified concerns that could lead to a catastrophic incident. The potential deficiencies were summarized and approved by the PSMC and submitted to management.\n\nAGE Refining Inc., currently uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform the evaluations required under the 29 CFR 1910.119 for the plant processes.

E. and an AGE Refining Inc.'s team , who have operating and maintenance experience. Recent analysis have been conducted by Tejas Environmental, Health & Safety and the plant PSM committee. The consultants and team performed the study and identified potential hazards of the plant processes within the confines of the operating units. The PSM committee submitted the recommendations to management.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings are based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PSMC and consultant. This ranking helps ensure that potential accidents assigned the highest risk received immediate attention. \n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original study, AGE Refining Inc. will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. The PSM committee findings will be forwarded to management for consideration.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nAGE Refining Inc., has established procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAGE Refining Inc. has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operations. New employees receive basic training in safety and refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.
