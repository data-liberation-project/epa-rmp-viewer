Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response\n policies \n\nWe at Soldier Canyon Filter Plant are committed to employee, \npublic and environmental safety.  This commitment is \ndemonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention \nprogram that covers areas such as operating procedures, \nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes \nat our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate \ncontrols to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly \ntrained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and \nmitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely \ncoordinated with Poudre Valley Fire Authority which provides \nadditional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility which\nis Chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 12000\nlbs.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative \nRelease Scenario, including administrative controls \nand mitigation measures to limit the distances for each \nreported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis \nfor our facility, we have used the look-up tables and \nequations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite \nConsequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs \nprovide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-Case Analysis\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from\nthe Chlorine room.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb.\nof Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The Release rate \n(lbs/min) is calculated to be 200. A distance to endpoint of \n5.4 miles is obtained which affects  a residential population \nof 21078 within this distance.\n\n\nToxic Alternative-Case Analysis\n\nThe Alternative Case scenario involves a release from the Chlorine \nroom.  The scenario involves the release of 16.2 lb. of Chlorine \nin"

The following sections briefly \ndescribe the elements of the release prevention program that\nis in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSoldier Canyon Filter Plant maintains a detailed record of \nsafety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating \nparameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that \nhazards associated with our processes are identified and \ncontrolled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry \nout these analyses is What-If/Checklist.  The studies are \nundertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in\nengineering and process operations and are revalidated \nperiodically.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis \nare addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within \nour covered processes, Soldier Canyon Filter Plant maintains \nwritten operating procedures.  These procedures address \nvarious modes of operation such as initial startup, normal \noperations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, \nemergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a \nturnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is \nreadily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nSoldier Canyon Filter Plant has a comprehensive training \nprogram in place to e"

New employees receive basic \non-the-job training in process operations followed by on-the-job \nsupervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. \nRefresher training is provided periodically and more frequently \nas needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nSoldier Canyon Filter Plant carries out highly documented \nmaintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper \noperations.  Process equipment examined by these checks \nincludes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, \npiping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown \nsystems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are \ncarried out by qualified personnel with previous training\nin maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel \nare offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment \ndeficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are \ncorrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nSoldier Canyon Filter Plant conducts audits on a regular \nbasis to determine whether the provisions set out under \nthe RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are \ncarried out at least every 3 years and any corrective \nactions required as a result of the audits are undertaken \nin a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nSoldier Canyon Filter Plant promptly investigates any \nincident that has resulted in, or could reasonably \nresult in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  \nThese investigations are undertaken to identify the \nsituation leading to the incident as well as any corrective \nactions to prevent the release from reoccurring.
