      "SummaryText": "Edwards Chemicals, Inc. is a chemical distribuitor to municipalities, general industry and a custodial product distribuitor to municipalities, industry and school districts.   Our facility is located at 1504 Roseport Road - Elwood, KS  66024.  The toxic chemical that is stored witin our facility are chlorine gas cylinders.  There is no processing, transfer or exposure beyond the storage of the cylinders.\r\n\r\nEdwards Chemicals is dedicated to the community, our employees and those communities we service. \r\n\r\nAll cylinders are stored in a closed, inaccessible area equipped with perimeter monitoring for any potential leakage or breakage of the actual cylinders.  All equipment is certified under the DOT and CGA standards.  Handling is done in accordance with the Chlorine Institute guidelines.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past 5 years.  An emergency response plan is in place and measures have been coordinated with the local Fire Department and the LEPC, onsite personnel are trained in how to complete a mitigating response should an unforeseen incident occur.\r\n\r\nOur facility has a fence around the entire facility with a security gate - we have also installed a security system with 24 hour camera monitoring. In our hazard assessment, we determined that it would enhance our security to move the storage location of the gas chlrone cylinders and to make a more secure area to store them in the facility, which we have done.  We have installed GPS on our delivery trucks to be able to rapidly identify and locate a vehicle in the event of its theft, or a reported\r\nsuspicous activity.  We have assigned all of our drivers, warehouse staff and management with celluar phones so they could immediately notify appropriate persons in the event of a chemical release, security breech or any other necessary reason for contact.  \r\n\r\nSafety is our number one goal and we work daily to meet or exceed safety and regulatory guidelines."
