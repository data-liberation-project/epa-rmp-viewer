Release Scenario Discussion\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform the following offsite consequence analyses.  Daikin has performed this analysis as required.  The summary of this analysis is not required to be included with the executirve summary.\r\n\r\nD. Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \r\n\r\nDaikin has not had any accidents within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nE. Management Program\r\n\r\nDaikin has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) to a qualified individual or position of responsibility.

(Daikin) is a fluorocarbon manufacturing facility located in Decatur, Alabama.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: chloroform, hydrogen fluoride (HF), ethylene, vinyl chloride and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE).  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 3 requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\r\n\r\nDaikin has a joint venture with 3M, called MDA Manufacturing, Inc. (MDA).  Daikin operates the MDA manufacturing process and oversees safety, environmental and maintenance for MDA.  In an emergency involving either Daikin or MDA, Daikin personnel will be directly involved.  According to Chapter 1 of the EPA General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), for joint ventures, A\u00bf the legal entity you have established to operate these processes should file the RMP.  If you consider the entity a subsidiary, you should be listed as the parent company in the RMP.  Therefore, Daikin is submitting the RMP for the covered process, which includes the MDA operations.\r\n\r\nHF and chloroform are delivered to the facility via railcars and are offloaded to storage tanks.  In the process, HF and chloroform are used as raw materials in the production of chlorodifluoromethane (R-22) at MDA.   \r\n\r\nTFE is produced from R-22 at Daikin.  TFE is stored in storage tanks and is used as a raw material for other Daikin products.  It is transported via pipeline to MDA to manufacture hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and is also transported via pipeline to a nearby 3M facility.\r\n\r\nEthylene is stored on site in a tank.  Ethylene is a raw material used in the production of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene at Daikin.  \r\n                                                                  \r\nViny"

The audits are completed by at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  A report of the findings is generated following the audit, and all deficiencies and/or recommendations are promptly addressed and the resolution is documented.  The two most recent safety audit reports are maintained at the facility.  The most recent safety audit not not yield any recommendations for changes.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - Specific incident investigation, reporting, and documentation procedures have been implemented and are followed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.81 in response to any incident involving a covered process that did or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  Under EPA RMP, a catastrophic release is defined as a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion involving one or more regulated substances that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to public heal"

Employees involved in the maintenance of the covered process receive additional training, which includes an overview of the process, its hazards, and applicable procedures to ensure that the employee can perform the job in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nWritten procedures have been developed to ensure that covered process equipment is properly maintained, tested, and inspected at regular, scheduled intervals and that such activities are thoroughly documented.  Maintenance, inspection and testing procedures and frequencies are consistent with applicable manufacturer's recommendations and follow accepted engineering practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance, inspection or testing are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  The mechanical integrity program also includes a quality assurance program\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) - A written MOC procedure has been implemented to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.75.  The MOC procedure does not apply to replacements in kind which are defined as replacements that satisfy the original design specifications (e.g., replace a pressure reducing valve with a new identical valve supplied by the original equipment manufacturer).\r\n\r\nPrior to introducing a change, the MOC procedure is implemented to ensure the following:\r\nA\u00b7 The technical basis for the change and its impact on health and safety have been fully evaluated;\r\nA\u00b7 Affected operating procedures and applicable process safety information have been updated accordingly; and\r\nA\u00b7 The schedule for implementing the change has been developed and required authorizations have been obtained.\r\n\r\nAll employees involved in operating or maintaining the modified process are informed of the change and"

A team is established to perform the incident investigation and always includes at least one person knowledgeable in the process, a contract employee if the incident involves work by a contractor, and other persons with appropriate qualifications to investigate an accident.\r\n\r\nFollowing the investigation, a written report is prepared summarizing the following information at a minimum: date of the incident; date the investigation began; description of the incident and any contributing factors; and any recommendations resulting from the investigation.  When completed, all affected personnel including contract employees review the report.  Incident investigation reports are maintained at the facility for a minimum of five years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - A written employee participation plan has been implemented that provides employees with access to PHA and all other information developed under the RMP regulation in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.83.  The employee participation plan describes employee participation in conducting PHA and in implementing all other RMP elements.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit - An authorization and permit program for hot-work operations has been prepared and implemented for hot-work conducted on or near a covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.85.  The permit is used to document that fire prevention and protection standards in 29 CFR Part 1910.252(a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot-work operations.

Periodically, the performance of the contract owner or operator is evaluated while working in or adjacent to a covered process.\r\n\r\nG. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nDaikin has an emergency response program that includes an emergency action plan addressing all EPA RMP regulated substances present at the facility.  The emergency action plan includes:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 Procedures for informing the Decatur/Morgan County LEPC and the community about any accidental releases;\r\nA\u00b7 Documentation of first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental exposures; and\r\nA\u00b7 Procedures for emergency response after and accidental release of a regulated substance.\r\nThe emergency action plan is reviewed annually to reflect changes at the facility and ensure that employees are informed of the changes.  The emergency response program includes procedures for the use of on-site emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance.  Employees are trained periodically on emergency response procedures.  \r\n\r\nH. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nIn an effort to improve safety and to reduce the risk of accidental releases, changes to the RMProgram and the facility will be implemented as identified.  These improvements may be identified either as risk reduction measures during the PHA or as a result of an improved RMProgram and the dedication to an inherently safer process."
