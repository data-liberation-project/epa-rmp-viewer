The plant has been designed and built to best engineering practices and in accordance with all relevant codes and regulations.\n\nThe plant was designed for optimal safety and efficiency by professional engineering contractors and consultants who made use of knowledge and experience garnered from over 50 years of operations at five Saiden facilities in Japan and two in Canada.\n\nSaiden Technologies uses a batch process in which monomers are reacted to form water-based emulsion polymers, which are then compounded into adhesives and other products for use in the carton, bag, label, construction, and other industries.  During the polymerization process, trained operators monitor reactions frequently and document readings.  Using human logic, pre-engineered safeguards, and automatic safety controls, thoroughly trained operators maintain control of the processes and prevent releases of chemicals from explosion, over-pressure or over-filling. Vinyl acetate monomer will be stored in bulk tanks, and acrylonitrile will be stored in a bulk tank.  These tanks have been built to ANSI codes and tested before and after installation to ensure integrity.  Daily operational procedures specify the use of checklists that include steps to record the tank levels and temperatures, as well as to visually inspect the dike around the tanks to ensure no tank is leaking. The daily recording of the tank levels provides a running record that can be used with inventory records to ensure that any leaks are detected immediately.\n\nSafety Program\n\nSaiden Technologies has a strong OSHA Process Safety Management program that is designed to prevent any accidental release of highly hazardous chemicals. Upper management and company ownership have supported the development of this pro"

Early in the development of the facility, an initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted.  While the plant was still in the \"green field\" stage, recommended changes to engineering plans were made before construction began.  After the design was finalized, follow-up PHA meetings were conducted to ensure that (1) recommendations from the initial meeting were resolved appropriately and (2) the PHA is consistent with the actual installation of the process equipment.  The company found the PHA to be an outstanding tool for training employees about the process and identifying and addressing potential hazards.  Not only did the PHA team address design issues, but also many necessary operating procedures, maintenance issues, and general safety issues were addressed and noted as required.  In September 26, 2002 a revalidation PHA was held to ensure recommendations from initial PHA had been addressed and moving acrylionitrile from drums to bulk storage was addressed.\n\nAll employees are encouraged to report anything they believe may cause an accident of any kind, whether it is an unsafe work practice or an unsafe condition.  These near miss reports, as well as incident reports, will be formally investigated following the facility's incident investigation procedure.  In addition, employees are encouraged to recommend process improvements, including changes in SOPs and suggestions to improve the process itself.  All employee suggestions will be researched and addressed.  Ownership of the safety program is very important. While developing this plan, employees have been consulted and involved at every step.  The Safety Committee at Saiden Technologies encompasses all groups of employees, not just upper management or shift supervisors.\n\nResponse Plans\n\nSaiden Technologies emergency response plan is written to cover spills, fires, and accidents.

The sprinkler system in the facility will be activated automatically if heat or smoke is detected.  This system is connected to a monitored alarm system, which will alert the monitoring company to call 911.  The local fire department has been given a list of all chemicals and their storage locations, along with a tour of the facility.  The standard NFPA labels will be on all large tanks or storage buildings for easy identification.  The local fire department is to be informed of any changes in chemicals or chemical inventories.\n\nKey production personnel are trained to the 24-hour HAZWOPER level to ensure that any accidental spill will be handled immediately and safely.  Spill kits are located throughout the facility in the most likely areas they will be needed.  Small spills will be contained, cleaned up, and disposed of according to all state and federal regulations.  An outside contractor will clean up any spill that is too large for Saiden Technologies personnel to handle.  Saiden Technologies will do everything possible to contain the spill until the contractor arrives.  \n\nIf the spill is above the reportable quantity, the Lee County Emergency Management (LCEM) office will be notified of how the spill is being handled.  If the release affects the natural environment or the public, the LCEM office will be notified immediately so that appropriate steps may be taken.  \n\nLCEM has been given a copy of our offsite consequence analysis report and a list of chemicals with storage locations.  LCEM also conducted a spill evaluation survey of the facility to verify that it has the proper information.  \n\nA representative of Saiden Technologies will serve as a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee and attend regular meetings.

It is important to be prepared, and there will be drills interspersed throughout the year.  All drills will be evaluated for effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nSince Saiden Technologies is a new facility, there is no 5-year accident history.  Saiden Technologies has been operating an adhesive compounding facility at another location in North Carolina for over 5 years, and has not had a reportable accident or incident.  (That location is neither an RMP nor PSM facility; however, we have adhered to general OSHA safety regulations, which have allowed us to operate effectively and safely.)  During our three years of operation Saiden Technologies has not had a spill that affected any public receptors or the environment.\n\nFuture Goals\nIt is Saiden Technologies' intent to treat the RMP plan and OSHA PSM program as living, growing documents.  As the plant operates and grows we will strive to ensure all changes are made in a manner that maintains or improves safety and environmental responsibility.  We will continue to build a strong environmental, health, and safety program through employee participation, compliance audits, maintaining SOPs, and community involvement."
