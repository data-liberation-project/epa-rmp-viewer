      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n7 Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n7 General facility and regulated substances information.\n7 Offsite consequence analysis results.\n7 Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n7 Five-year accident history summary.\n7 Emergency response program summary.\n7 Planned changes to improve safety.\nThe above information for the Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenan"

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \nThe DWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\nThe Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station is located at 2460 Holly Drive, Hollywood, California.  The chlorination station is located adjacent to the reservoir, off Holly Drive, east of the Hollywood Freeway. The facility serves to chlorinate Hollywood Reservoir water. After disinfection, water from the station is distributed for domestic and industrial consumption in the Hollywood area. The station consists of a chlorinator room, a chlorine storage room, an instrument room, pump room, and a two-ton capacity chlorine scrubber.  The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. A maximum of four one-ton chlorine containers is stored at the Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet station.  These containers are connected to the chlorination process to feed liquid and gaseous chlorine.  The one-ton conta"

The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\nIn normal operation, two chlorine 1-ton containers are manifolded together into a liquid header that connects to the evaporators.  These containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and feed liquid chlorine under pressure.  The actuators will close the angle valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  Two additional ton containers without actuators are connected through a gas supply header.  They bypass the evaporators, serving as an automatic backup when the primary containers run dry or the evaporator shuts down due to a low temperature condition. \nThe liquid chlorine passes from the containers through the evaporators where it is vaporized in a water bath.  The gaseous chlorine then proceeds to a vacuum regulator/check unit, where the gas goes from positive pressure to a vacuum. The gas then continues to one of the three chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  From there, gas is pulled by vacuum to either basement injectors or dam injectors.  Here the gas is dissolved into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The solution is then piped into the reservoir or reservoir outlet pipelines.\nA motorized shutoff valve is provided to stop chlorine flow to Chlorinator No. 2 when water flow in the Upper Hollywood Reservoir outlet pipeline"

This closes off the supply of chlorine to the chlorinator when chlorination is not needed.\nResidual chlorine analyzers monitor residual chlorine downstream of the diffusers and provide feedback control for subsequent dosing.\nChlorine leak detectors are provided to detect chlorine leaks in the chlorine room and the chlorinator room.  When a chlorine leak is detected, the detector signal activates a local audible and visual alarm as well as an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.\nThe station has installed a caustic solution scrubber actuated by chlorine detectors at a concentration of 3 ppm which can neutralize up to 4,000 lb of chlorine in case of a chlorine leak.\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorine facilities, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Loss of power will cause the backup generator to take over powering station controls.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily.  A response team coordinated from DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms which may occur. Access to the facility is through gates, which are kept locked all the time.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.

The chlorine release rate to the atmosphere was defined to be 200 lbs./min. No passive mitigation systems were considered in determining the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere.\nEPA and CalARP regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis should appropriately account for the density of the released gas.  Since the chlorine cloud formed during the worst-case release scenario would be denser-than-air, the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) model was used for performing the air dispersion modeling analysis.\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (1120F), and average humidity (61%) were used for the dispersion modeling analysis.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the worst-case scenario has offsite impacts. \nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.

      "SummaryText": " the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the hazard review.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no chlorine releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the hazard review, which would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement. \nThe scenario selected for the Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station chlorination system involves the release of chlorine liquid from a crack in one of the pigtails connecting a ton container feeding liquid chlorine to the chlorination process.  The container is equipped with the Halogen actuator and a leak in one pigtail will cause the actuators to close the angle valves on the containers.  It was estimated that the piping from the pigtail to the evaporator contains approximately 20 lbs of chlorine and the evaporator holds an additional 100 lbs.  The alternative release scenario accounts for the full 120 lbs to backflow out the pigtail hole.  It is assumed that the crack developed in < inch diameter pigtail corresponds to a hole of 0.0625-inch (1/16-inch) diameter. The control room would have been warned of the chlorine leak by the chlorine monitors installed at the chlorination facility at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm.  At a concentration of 3 ppm, the scrubber is automatically activated at the facility.  At a concentration of 10 ppm, the Halogen actuators close the angle valves "

No passive mitigation systems were considered.  Three active mitigation systems considered are the actuation of a chlorine detector, the use of Halogen valve actuators, and the operation of the scrubber.\nThe chlorine release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 10 lb/min (EPA, 1998b).  However, the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.003 lb/min.  Based on the chlorine release rate of 10 lb/min (EPA, 1998b) and the release duration of 12 minutes to empty the line, the total quantity of chlorine released inside the storage room was estimated at 120 lb for the alternative release scenario.\nEPA's SCREEN 3, a steady state screening model, was used for the selected alternative release scenario.  The results obtained using this model are expected to be conservative (higher concentrations).  SCREEN3 is a Gaussian dispersion model applicable to continuous releases of non-reactive, non-dense gases that are emitted from point or area sources (EPA, 1998a). The user may predict a conservative worst-case result based on a pre-selected range of worst-case meteorological combinations or may select individual wind speed and stability categories for analysis.  The wind speed and stability class combinations considered in the SCREEN3 model for the alternative analysis is the EPA recommended default combination of wind speed of 3 m/s and atmospheric stability of D.  The SCREEN3 model predicts one-hour average concentrations for the modeled pollutants.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3ppm.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the alternative release scenario has no offsite impacts. \nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Lower Hol"
