The vacuum process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.  \r\n\r\no Plant inventories are being maintained to a maximum of 32 ton containers of chlorine and 16 tons of sulfur dioxide at the site.\r\n\r\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. The services of a Hazmat Team to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Response Drills are scheduled periodically.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization continues an active safety program. Veolia has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\r\n\r\nAt the Wastewater Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review or training on OSHA subjects and/or discuss a safety issue and hazard preventions. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\r\n\r\n- Hazard Communications\r\n\r\n-Personal Protective Equipment\r\n\r\n-Lockout/Tagout\r\n\r\n-Confined Space"
