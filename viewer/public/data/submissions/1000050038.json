We use a combination of accident release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help insure the safety of our employees, the public and the environment. We adhere to the Chemours corporate philosophy of the commitment is zero. This means that we constantly strive for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries. Our site safety, operating and emergency response procedures are available to all site employees via electronic access on computers throughout the plant.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\nThe Chemours Company - Fayetteville Works consists of approximately 2200 acres located on the Bladen - Cumberland county line, adjacent to N.C. highway 87, approximately 15 miles southeast of Fayetteville, N.C.  Approximately 400 acres are currently used for Chemours Company - Fayetteville Works manufacturing and two tennant manufacturing operations.  A solar energy facility is being constructed on approximately 400 acres that will be unmanned when construction is completed.  The remainder of the property is set-aside for future manufacturing needs.\r\nThe SO3 process at Fayetteville is a Prevention Program 3 processes due to regulated toxic chemicals with off-site impact potential. The SO3 process produces chemical intermediates using Sulfur Trioxide.\r\nThe TFE process is a Prevention Program 1 processes since the regulated chemical is flammable with no off-site impact. TFE is used to produce a polymer for membranes used in fuel cells and the Chloralkali industry. In the production of those products, the regulated substance Tetrafluoroethylene is used.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Chemours Company - Fayetteville Works is in compliance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40CFR Part 68.

Periodic Process Hazards Analyses are conducted to review the entire process to ensure safe operation and compliance with design guidelines. Materials of construction are strictly controlled to ensure the mechanical integrity of the systems. Extensive operating and safety instrumentation include alarms, interlocks and gas detectors that allow the operators to continuously monitor and control the process conditions. Process safety critical equipment and instruments are identified and routinely tested or inspected to ensure proper operation and mechanical integrity. A work order and permit system is used to control maintenance work. Maintenance and operations personnel are trained and qualified via a rigorous training program. Operating and maintenance procedures are documented and available to personnel either via hard copy or electronic copies on computers located throughout the operating areas.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no on site injuries and no off site injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage due the accidental release of RMP regulated substances from the\r\nChemours Company - Fayetteville Works in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe site has an emergency response team staffed 24 hrs./day, 365 days/year that is trained to respond to fire, medical or hazmat emergencies.
