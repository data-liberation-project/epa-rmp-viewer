The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n\n\n- Adding Acrylonitrile Transfers from Marine Vessels into a Rail Car, and subsequent transfers of the Acrylonitrile from the loaded Rail Car into ISO Tank Containers for shipment off-site.  Acrylonitrile represents a regulated toxic substance to be handled above the Threshold Quantity in a new covered process at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \n\n\n\n- Updating the maximum on-site inventories for all RMP regulated chemicals handled at the facility, and  \n\n\n\n- Various data element updates since the previous RMP certification.  \n\n\n\n\n\n? 68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nStolthaven Houston, Inc. is committed to operating and maintaining our processes related to bulk chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.  The facility uses a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to protect the environment and to ensure the safety of our employees and assets, our industrial neighbors, and the citizens of the surrounding community.  This Executive Summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Stolthaven Houston, Inc. has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and the substances regulated by 40 CFR 68 that may be handled on-site in stationary sources above their corresponding Threshold Quantities.\n\n\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\n\n\n- A five-year history of significant accidental releases, if applicable, from processes covered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n- An overview of our"

The facility currently consists of 188 above-ground storage tanks that vary in capacity from 2,000-barrels up to 110,000-barrels, five truck loading/unloading racks (Truck Racks T-3, T-4, T-5, T-6, and T-8), four rail car loading/unloading racks (Rail Racks R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-5), one dedicated barge dock (Barge Dock-C), a finger pier jetty equipped with two separate marine vessel berths for handling barges and ships (Ship Dock 2/3), and a new jetty placed into service in October of 2019 also for handling barges and ships (Ship Dock 11).  A rail car cleaning and intermodal transfer station (Rail Rack R-4 and Truck Rack T-7) is also located within the Stolthaven Houston Terminal, and a biological waste water treatment plant and various air pollution control devices are operated on-site to reduce the impact of the Stolthaven Houston Terminal's operations on the environment.\n\n\n\nBulk liquid products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes of transportation cargo container including tank trucks, ISO tank containers, flexi-bags, rail tank cars, barges, and marine parcel tankers.  The received liquid products are stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and are subsequently transferred off-site through one or more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  Stolthaven Houston, Inc. also performs direct product transfers between marine vessels and rail tank cars with no intermediate storage in the facility's above-ground storage tanks."

Maximum chemical inventories reported with this RMP for Isopentane and n-Pentane conservatively assume that six rail cars loaded with 31,500-gallons of each cargo are held simultaneously on the facility's storage tracks.

Tank P50-5, which represents the facility's largest volume of VAM held in a single storage vessel, was placed into VAM service for the first time on February 25, 2010.  VAM is received into this tank via barge delivery using a dedicated marine dock line.  Product is stored and subsequently shipped outbound according to customer requirements via marine parcel tankers, and occasionally by barges, that load at Stolthaven Houston's existing Ship Dock 2/3.  VAM may also be transferred periodically directly from barges into rail tank cars with no intermediate product storage, and VAM slops can also be received into the terminal from marine vessels berthed at Stolthaven Houston's docks.  \n\n\n\nIn November of 2017 Stolthaven Houston placed IFR Storage Tank P50-4 into VAM servi"

As a result of the 2017 VAM storage project for Tank P50-4, piping modifications were completed in P-Manifold to connect the marine transfer system for Tank P50-4 into the existing Dock Line P-D3-78, which was already in place for Tank P50-5 and dedicated exclusively to VAM service.  A new VAM filter-pot was also installed adjacent to Storage Tank P50-4.  \n\n\n\nNote that the 2017 Tank P50-4 VAM storage project did not change the Stolthaven Houston Terminal's worst-case release scenario for VAM, as the maximum quantity of this material held in any one tank did not increase. Stolthaven Houston's permanent, stationary fire-water protection systems in the immediate area of Tank P50-5 were also upgraded to provide additional cooling water if-needed in the event of an emergency incident involving any of the the facility's flammable or combustible liquid storage tanks in close proximity.  Existing portable water delivery systems also remain available should they be needed in the event of an emergency.

A parcel of Acrylonitrile will be transferred directly from a marine vessel berthed at Stolthaven Houston's Ship Dock 2/3 into a rail car spotted at the facility's Rail Rack R-3.

Note that after emptying the rail cars, Stolthaven Houston may then clean the cars containing only Acrylonitrile residue at the terminal's R-4 Rail Car Cleaning Rack. \n\n\n\nAdditional safeguards to be implemented for Acrylonitrile handling operations include, but are not limited to: verification of appropriate inhibitor level in the liquid Acrylonitrile before the cargo direct transfer operation from ship-to-rail car commences, use of the buddy system during all Acrylonitrile transfer operations and equipment connections/disconnections, applying a nitrogen pre-purge to below 5-percent oxygen content inside the dock line, rail car, and ISO Tank Containers to provide an inert atmosphere in all applicable equipment that will handle Acrylonitrile, vapor control using a flare for all rail car and ISO Tank Container loading operations, overfill protection installed in all ISO Tank Containers prior to commencing Acrylonitrile loading, fitting all rail cars receiving Acrylonitrile with a magnetic gauge rod to assist with inventory verification, and using third-party surveyors to pull and retain any required Acrylonitrile samples.  \n\n\n\nFor the purpose of defining maximum chemical inventories noted in this RMP, the densities of all regulated substances at their lowest expected operating temperatures were chosen to provide conservative estimates for the maximum chemical quantities (in pounds) that may be on-site at one time.
