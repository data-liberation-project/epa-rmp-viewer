      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155 Introduction\n\n\n\nThe USEPA's RMP regulation, 40 CFR 68, was published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, and developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental release of highly toxic or flammable\n\nchemicals. The RMP regulation applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process per 40 CFR 68.115.\n\n\n\nThe USEPA has established three (3) tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts. These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2 and 3. Program 1 is\n\ndefined by a process that has had no accidental release causing offsite impacts in the past five (5) years or the nearest public receptor is beyond the distance to a toxic or flammable endpoint based\n\non the worst-case release scenario. Program 3 applies to a process that is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) or is not classified in\n\nany of the Program 3 NAICS codes defined in 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1). Program 2 applies to processes not defined by Program 1 or 3. Therefore, the E. Morgan Stickney Water Filtration Plant processes are\n\nsubject to Program 2 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe Mobile Area Water and Sewer System (MAWSS) operates the E. Morgan Stickney facility located at 4800 Moffat Road in Mobile, Alabama. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for treated\n\nsurface water storing approximately twelve (12) one-ton cylinders containing chlorine. The Stickney facility utilizes more than the threshold quantity of chlorine as defined in 40 CFR 68.150;\n\ntherefore, the facility is required to submit an RMP. The initial RMP was submitted by June 21, 1999. A five (5) year update was made by Malcolm Pirnie in January 2005 updating the offsite\n\nconsequence analyses determining whether the parameters and assumptions used are still valid. To comply with the five (5) year update requirement in 2010, Goodwyn Mills C"

In 2016 and 2021, GMC\n\nand the Operations staff of the E. Morgan Stickney Facility reviewed and updated the plan.\n\n\n\n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Stickney facility has established procedures to ensure the integrity of the chlorination systems and minimize the potential for releases. Standard protocols have been established for items such\n\nas systems operations, maintenance, training, and incident investigation. To ensure the safety of the Stickney facility chlorination, the facility relies on the commitment and team effort of its\n\nemployees and suppliers.\n\n\n\nThe Stickney facility has a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of fifteen (15) employees on duty at any given time, who are trained on safe operation of the chlorination systems. Daily inspections of\n\nthe areas storing and/or using chlorine are conducted by the facility employees. The area that stores the containers is fully enclosed and is equipped with a caustic scrubber for control of a\n\nchlorine release. The caustic scrubber system is equipped with chlorine detectors that will automatically activate the scrubber system if a chlorine concentration of three (3) parts per million\n\nor greater is present. In addition, MAWSS has installed an emergency chlorine valve actuator, which will shut off flow from the ton containers within 30 seconds after detecting a leak. The system also\n\ncontains an emergency \"panic button\" located outside of the storage area to allow for operator initiated emergency shut-off.\n\n\n\nAll potential releases from the Stickney facility will be responded to by the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency (MCEMA), whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine\n\nat the facility. The MCEMA would dispatch experienced HAZMAT personnel trained to respond to such emergencies.\n\n\n\n68.155"

      "SummaryText": "(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Stickney facility stores and handles chlorine and is a stationary source potentially subject to 40 CFR 68. The facility has four (4) one-ton chlorine cylinders connected at all times. A header pipe\n\nsupplies chlorine to three locations: the chlorine dioxide generator, the plant filter flume, and to the settle flume for pre-chlorination to the filters from the 500pound chlorinator. The containers are\n\nthen moved inside the building for storage and usage. In addition to the four (4) connected cylinders, up to eight (8) additional cylinders are stored inside the building that are either full waiting\n\nto be used or empty waiting to be shipped.\n\n\n\nGaseous chlorine from the one-ton cylinders is drawn by a vacuum though one of the two rotometers, which serve to feed chlorine at a specified rate to the ejector system. The gaseous\n\nchlorine is mixed with treated water to form a chlorine solution. The chlorine solution is injected into the water at the filter flume feed point. The water is then distributed for use by the residents\n\nof the City of Mobile.\n\n\n\n68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Steps\n\n\n\nWorst-case and alternative case release scenarios were conducted as required for the Prevention Program 2 process. Emergency response activities have been coordinated with local responders\n\nas required for the Prevention Program 2 process. Lastly, a program and document management system is in place. The Prevention Program 2 process allows streamlined prevention program\n\nrequirements; however, implementation of the following elements are required:\n\n? safety information,\n\n? hazard review,\n\n? operating procedures,\n\n? training,\n\n? maintenance,\n\n? compliance audits, and\n\n? incident investigations.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, GMC, with the assistance of Stickney facility management and staff, conducted a compliance audit and a hazard review of the chlorine system using the \"What-If\" analysis.

In 2016 and 2021, this \"What\n\nIf\" analysis was reviewed to ensure the findings were still valid.\n\n\n\n68.155(d) Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Stickney facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine within the last five (5) years that have resulted in on-site injuries, off-site injuries, and/or off-site impacts.\n\n\n\n68.155(e) Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIf a significant release, according to 40 CFR 68.155, were to occur, a Stickney facility employee would immediately contact the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency (MCEMA), whose\n\nmembers are aware of the presence of chlorine at the facilities. The MCEMA would dispatch experience HAZMAT personnel trained to respond to such emergencies.
