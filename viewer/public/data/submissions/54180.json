      "SummaryText": "The Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority (PRASA) has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for management and prevention of risks associated with the storage and use of chlorine, a regulated toxic substance, at the Aguadilla Nueva Filtration Plant.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112?(1).  The Prevention Program elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29 FR Part 1910.119. The facility has two regulated process. The main process is the injection of chlorine for didinfection. The maximun inventory for this process is 28,000 pounds. The other process is a warehouse containing 150 pounds cylinders for distribution among neighbording plants. This maximun inventory for this process is 4,500 punds for a total of 32,500 pounds for the whole facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and State requirements.  The disinfection  process at the Aguadilla Nueva Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Aguadilla Nueva Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine.  The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at Aguadilla Nueva Filtration Plant and the immediately surrounding areas.  Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency response program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Aguadilla Nueva Filtration Plant supplies water to the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water, destroying microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\nChlorine for injection is delivered to the facility via "

      "SummaryText": "truck in ton containers.  The storage building has space for up fourteen full containers, a total of 28,000 pounds of chlorine.  Chlorine containers are connected to vacuum chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate chlorine use.  From the chlorinators, chlorine gas is distributed under vacuum to injectors.  The injectors combine the gaseous chlorine with water.  The chlorinated water is mixed with the water plant flow for disinfection. Chlorine for distribution is delivered to the facility via truck in 150 pound cylinders. The cylinders are stored until they are distributed to the user facilities.\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The worst-case release scenario is a vapor release of the entire contents of a ton container over a ten minute period (200 pounds of chlorine per minute). Other worst-case assumptions required by EPA include a low wind speed (1.5 meters per second), stable atmosphere (Class F), urban topography, and no active mitigation of the release.\n\nEPA requires the determination of the area (zone of vulnerability) which may be exposed to a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm or greater.  According to the American Industrial HygieneAssociation, 3 ppm is the maximum concentration of chlorine in air below which nearly all people could be exposed for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on the worst-case assumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extend 1.3 miles from the chlorine storage area.\n\nThe following are known to be within the zone of vulnerability for the worst-case release scenario: residences, school, religious institution, and recreational areas (lake).\n\nApproximately 21,950 residents are located within a 1.3 mile radius of the chlorine storage area.  Many of these residents would not actually be impacted in even a worst-case release, as the chlorine would travel in the direction of wi"

No known environmental receptors (such as state parks or officially designated wildlife preserves) are located within the zone of vulnerability.\n\nThe conditions and parameters for the worst-case scenario are specified by EPA.  A more realistic alternative release scenario was examined, also following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The alternative release scenario is a vapor release of the entire contents of a ton container through a broken 3/8 inch flexible connector tube.  If the container was not shut off, the contents would be released at a rate of 21 pounds of chlorine per minute over a 95 minute period.  More typical weather conditions are also used (wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, atmospheric stability Class D).  Other conditions remain the same as in the worst-case scenario (urban topography and no mitigation of the release).\n\nThe zone of vulnerability for the alternative release scenario is determined to extend 0.1 miles from the chlorine storage area.  Approximately 50 residents are located within a 0.1 miles radius of the chlorine storage area.  These residents and recreational area could be impacted, depending on the direction of wind.  No known environmental receptors are located within the zone of vulnerability.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nPRASA complies with PROSHO requirements for Prevention Programs and for Process Safety Management.  Operators, maintenance staff and contractors are informed of chlorine hazards, and hazard signs are posted in the chlorine storage area.  Standard operating and maintenance procedures have been developed, and employees who work with chlorine are provided training.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPRASA has an emergency response program.  Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warning of any leak.  Leak repair kits are maintained on site, and operators are trained in how to q"

The emergency response program is coordinated with State Emergency Management Agency for notification of the public.\n\nPRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training. All PRASA facilities are scheduled to receive refresher training.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site; or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPRASA uses Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety.  Issues identified from a PHA are then addressed in PRASA's Prevention Program. Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent training in operating and maintenance procedures, and an improved preventative maintenance program.  An audit of the RMP and PSM programs will be conducted within three years to verify the effectiveness of the program."
