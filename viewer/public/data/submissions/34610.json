              "Description": "This process area is composed of three units:  the E-2, E-4 and E-7 units which produce products that are used in the metal working lubricants, soaps, floor polishes and paper by reacting E-2, ammonia and ethylene oxide (E-4) and ammonia and glycol (E-7).  The units contain reactors, vessels and separation towers.  All the risk management program elements apply.  The last PHA covering E2 was 02/24/2003.  The last PHA covering E4 was 10/28/2003 and the last PHA covering E7 was 08/21/2000.  All units contain their own storage facilities operated at the units.  Dikes exist in E4, E2 and E7.  Flares apply only to E7.  Process area detectors apply to E4 and E7.",

Both units react ethylene oxide with either nonylphenol or linear alcohols to form nonylphenolethoxylates and linear alcohol ethyoxylates which are used in industrial and household detergents, among other products.  (The last PHA covering E-3 was in 06/19/2000.  The last PHA covering E-6 was in 01/25/2000 (this is the most recent for the process).  E-3 unit consists of 3 reactors and associated equipment to charge, react and store product which is non-hazardous.  E-6 unit consists of 5 reactors and associated equipment.  All the risk management program elements apply except for PSSR.  No changes have been significant enough at E-3 or E-6 to require a PSSR.  All changes have been managed by MOCs.",

The G units react ethylene oxide and water for ethylene glycol (see Executive Summary for uses of ethylene glycol).  G-1 unit receives the cycle water bleed streams produced in the F units and recovers antifreeze-grade glycol.  G-2 unit reacts propylene oxide with water to form grades of propylene glycol (see Executive Summary).  G-2 unit can also produce ethylene glycol. G-3 unit produces ethylene glycol by purifying reclaimed ethylene glycol returned by polyestermanufacturers and by dewatering and dehydrating cycle water and does not contain covered chemicals.  (G-1, G-5 and G-6 last PHA ? 09/22/2000; G-2 last PHA ? 06/22/2000; G-3 & G-6 last PHA ? 11/15/2000)  The risk management program elements for the units listed apply to all units.

              "Description": "The F-5, PO/MTBE process area consists of six sections which are the Feed Preparation, the Peroxidation Reaction, the Epoxidation Reaction, the TBA Purification, the PO Purification and the MTBE sections.  The Feed Preparation Section (last PHA on 01/10/2002) consist of purification towers to purify and concentrate isobutane prior to charging the Peroxidation Section (last PHA 01/22/2001) for reaction with a RMP non-covered chemical.  The Epoxidation Section (last PHA 05/02/2002) manufactures propylene oxide by reacting propylene with a RMP non-covered chemical.  The Tertiary Butyl Alcohol section (last PHA 02/18/2002)reclaims and purifies tertiary butyl alcohol for reuse; the Propylene Oxide Section (last PHA 05/14/2003) does the same for propylene oxide.  The MTBE section (last PHA 08/05/2002) manufactures and purifies MTBE.  The risk management program's elements apply to the F-5 unit.  The flammable mixture mass noted below includes inventories of non-RMP flammable chemical and RMP flammable chemicals below the threshold quantity.  RMP chemicals below the threshold quantity included in the flammable mixture are acetaldehyde, methane, butane and pentane.  This process unit has associated diked storage tanks.",

              "Description": "The A3 Process Unit is divided into the following three sections.  the Furnace Section, the Cracked Gas Compression, Refrigeration and Tower sections, and the A3 offsites section. The Furnace section includes from the feed system through the furnaces up through the quench columns. The compression, refrigeration and tower section includes compression, refrigeration and separation equipment downstream of the furnace section as well as an acetylene hydrogenation unit. The A3 includes tankage and ethylene metering skids associated with the A3 Process. All risk management process controls, mitigation, monitoring and detection systems apply to all units as noted below.  Only tankage has dikes and only tankage does not have a quench system and excess flow devices. Only the furnace unit does not have tandem seals.  The flammable mixture mass noted below includes inventories of non-RMP flammable chemicals and RMP flammable chemicals below the threshold quantity. RMP chemicals below the threshold quantity included in the flammable mixture are hydrogen, acetylene, propadiene, vinyl acetylene, pentane, ethylacetylene, and 1,3- pentadiene.\n\nThe A3 Process Unit has been shut down since May 31, 2001 with the exception of the Custody Transfer Stations (last PHA done 03/31/2003) and the Propylene Section ( last PHA 03/27/2003) for a short while.  The A3 Process Unit is expected to be re-started and PHAs will be revalidated prior to startup.",

If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.\n\nPre-Startup Review\nHuntsman O&O performs pre-startup safety reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a major change in the process safety information or is deemed as requiring more review than the combination of  a Management of Change and Process Hazard Analysis.  The pre-startup safety review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n\nCompliance Audit\nHuntsman O&O performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its Process Safety Management Program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.  \n\nIncident Investigation\nHuntsman O&O investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman O&O has established a procedure to appoint an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident inv"
