HED(US) has a strong corporate commitment to employee and public safety as well as environmental protection.  HED(US) has been active in coordinating emergency planning and preparedness with local responders.  HED(US) is in compliance with the following safety and environmental regulations and provisions:\n\n\u00bf\tOccupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) 1983 Toxic and Hazardous Substances Hazard Communication Standard (HCS).  This regulation covers the training of employees, chemical labeling, maintaining current Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), and communicating hazard information to employees.\n\u00bf\tOSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation.  This regulation covers the requirements of training personnel who will be \u00bfFirst Responders\u00bf for emergency situations, including chemical accidents and releases.\n\u00bf\tHED(US) has developed an Emergency Planning and Response Plan in accordance with Best Management Practices (BMP).  This plan is reviewed and updated annually in accordance with BMP requirements.  HED(US) is certified under International Standards Organization (ISO) 14000 and has performed drills and audits to demonstrate the effectiveness of the emergency response procedures.  This plan includes notification of local authorities and the public in the event of the release of hazardous substances.\n\nHED(US) is primarily a manufacturer of color picture tubes for the electronics industry.  The North American Industry Classification System Code for the overall facility is 334411: Electron Tube Manufacturing.  HED(US) does not produce any hazardous substances, but uses small quantities of several regulated substances in plant processes.  The EPA  Risk Management Program (RMP) provides Threshold Quantities (TQs) which are the minimum quantity of each regulated"

      "SummaryText": "chemical stored on site that will require preparation of a Risk Management Plan. In December of 1998, HED(US) compiled a list of all regulated chemicals used at the facility and determined the maximum quantity of each chemical that would be stored at the facility at any given time.  HED(US) identified 6 regulated substances that were used at the facility that are not stored in quantities or concentrations above the TQs.  In accordance with the EPA RMP regulation, these substances are not included in this RMP. HED(US) identified one substance, an acid, that is stored in excess of the EPA RMP TQs.  This RMP is submitted for this acid.  The acid is purchased in 55-gallon drums contained in overpack drums. There is only one location where the total quantity of this acid exceeds the EPA\u00bfs TQ.  The drums are stored until use in the Hazardous Materials Storage Building.  There is a potential to have as much as 12,000 pounds of the acid in this storage building.  Our philosophy is to avoid accidents and releases through adherence to sound operating procedures.  Recognizing the potential for human error, equipment failure and unforeseen circumstances, HED(US) has emergency procedures in place and has coordinated with local organizations and agencies including police, fire, hospitals, rescue squads, ambulance services, and state and county emergency response teams.\n\nIn the event of a release from the facility, HED(US) is prepared to act quickly and decisively to notify emergency response personnel and the public while at the same time taking any possible actions to mitigate the potential for on-site and off-site damage."
