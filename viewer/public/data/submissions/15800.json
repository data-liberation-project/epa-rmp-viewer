Also evaluated in to the process where the less hazardous safety and health concern.\n\nThe Sodus Cold storage in the past has developed other programs as required by agencies such as OSHA, EPA, and the DEC.  Along with the developmented programs in the past numerous safety training have been developed and carried out with in the company.  With the development of these safety programs we feel the company has made the facility a safer place to work and to live near.  The Sodus Cold Storage has also been very active in its drive to make the equipment that we maintain the safest that it can be.  Our planned maintenance programs have been developed and implemented to assure the safety through safer equipment.\n\nIn the past five years not only has the Sodus Cold storage has not had any accidental release of ammonia.\n\nSodus Cold Storage annually invites the local emergency response personal to our facility to further educate them to our operations potentials."
