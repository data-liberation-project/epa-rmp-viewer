Mitigation controls include sprinklers, enclosure, and water sprays.  Specifically, all equipment has relief valves, except compressors 302 and C303; and evaporators AU 311, 317A, 318, 329, 320, 321, 322, and 327A.  All equipment has manual shutoffs, except evaporators 323A/B, 324A/B, and 327.  Automatic shutoffs are installed for all evaporators, and vessels except VV501, V301, V304, V305, V306, and V307.  Detection alarms are in place for all equipment except outdoor items, namely condensers and vessels V503, V504, V306, and V307.  Notification procedures apply to the entire process, regardless of location.  Grounding equipment is not instelled on the major piping components of the system (vessels, heat exchangers, evaporators, condensers, and compressors), but motors throughout the system are grounded.  Excess flow devices are installed for all evaporators except AU311; and vessels V301, V305, V306, and V307.  Sprinkler mitigation controls apply to all the equipment within enclosures except evaporator Au327.  Vessels not within enclosures include V503, V504, V304, V306, and V307.",

Specifically, all equipment (except evaporators) has relief valves; manual shutoffs, detection alarms (except outdoor equipment); and notification procedures are in place for all equipment regardless of location.  All equipment is grounded.  Check valves are employed with all compressors, evaporators, and vessels except V515, V516, and V520.  Evaporators have automatic shutoffs.  One vessel (V303) has a back-up pump.  Mitigation is provided by enclosure and a sprinkler system to all areas of the refrigeration equipment except the outdoor condensers.",

      "SummaryText": "For this 2004 resubmission of the updated RMP for Washington Beef--Toppenish facility, please refer to the file, EXECSU~1.DOC, which is the Executive Summary attached to the original RMP.\n\nSince the original PHA and RMP, no evaporators have been added to the facility's systems.  One screw compressor has been added, which accommodates greater product throughput.  One evaporative condenser has also been added, sized more than proportionately larger than the compressor in order to achieve energy savings.  These items are identical in operating parameters and procedures to the preexisting plant equipment; therefore no revisions of Standard Operating Procedures occurred on this account other than P&ID minor updates.  To accommodate the operating charge of the new components, approximately 200 pounds of ammonia was added.  This crossed no thresholds, but the Offsite Consequences Analysis has been adjusted and rounded accordingly.  \n\nThe entire facility has developed a new Emergency Action (Response) Plan."
