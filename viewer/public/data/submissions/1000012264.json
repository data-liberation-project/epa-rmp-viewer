It is Trident Seafoods intent to enforce the policies and procedures presented in this document to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances or reduce the severity of those releases that do occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0 POLICIES IN PLACE:\n\n\n\nTrident Seafoods, complies with Clean Air Act and Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) air emissions regulations and has polices in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0 SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE:\n\n\n\nTrident Seafoods of Bedford, Virginia is a food processing facility (SIC Code 2038).  Trident Seafoods uses compressed anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7) in its refrigeration system to cool and freeze foods.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and, with this document, the Clean Air Act Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations.  Trident Seafoods , Inc, relies on a system of equipment maintenance and periodic testing to prevent accidental releases.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases, should they occur, are mitigated by storing only a portion of the total amount of anhydrous ammonia on-site in the pressure tanks.  \n\n\n\n\n\n4.0 ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nOver the past five (5) years, Trident Seafoods has not experienced any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nTrident Seafoods does not have an emergency response plan which has been coordinated with community emergency responders.  The facility relies entirely on outside local community emergency response teams to address major ammonia releases. The local Bedford Fire Department tours this plant yearly and is aware of the ammonia system that is used in the production process.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO I"
