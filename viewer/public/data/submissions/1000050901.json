The computerized process control system has its own power backup.\r\nFive-year Accident History:\r\n\r\nNo release of a regulated substance has occurred in the last 5 years that resulted in or could have resulted in off-site consequences.\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nThe Speer Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for Speer Plant is coordinated with Gilcrest / Platteville Fire Protection District. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Speer Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the La Salle Fire Department and the Gilcrest / Platteville Fire Protection District.\r\nPlanned Chan"
