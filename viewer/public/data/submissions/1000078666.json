This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nAndeavor's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  Andeavor's Vermillion Gas Plant has coordinated with the Rock Springs Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nThe Vermillion Gas Plant is located approximately 55 miles southeast of the town of Rock Springs, Wyoming.\n\n\n\nThe Vermillion Gas Plant is a 57 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/day) cryogenic natural gas processing plant. Input to the plant includes sweet wellstream gas. The plant produces a mixed NGL stream of 2,500 barrels per day maximum.  The plant consists of two (2) process trains which operate in a similar fashion and are composed of similar equipment.\n\n\n\nThe gas stream is compressed to increase the pressure to allow processing through the Vermillion Gas Plant. The gas next goes through mol-sieve dehydrator beds for final moisture removal.  Out of the mol-sieve dehydrators, the gas is directed to one of two cryogenic turboexpander trains for processing.  The gas from the demethanizer is recompressed by the residue compressors up to sales line pressure and sold down the pipeline.  Natural gas liquids from the processing trains are sent to pressurized storage tanks to await shipment via pipeline to sales markets. \n\n\n\nThese substances are regulated under the RMP program and considered a flammable mixture.

      "SummaryText": "determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.3 miles and qualifies for Program 1 due to the plant's distance from any public receptors.  The Worst Case Scenario is 72,000 pounds released flammable mixture due to a total release of PV-16.14 NGL Surge Tank.  The Alternative Scenario is 9,670 pounds released flammable mixture due to pipe leak scenario. \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Action Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe Vermillion Gas Plant maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency action including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for all personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post incident clean up requirements.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\n\n\n\nAndeavor employees and contractors receive training in these procedures as necessary.\n\n\n\nEmergency Action Plan is updated as needed."
