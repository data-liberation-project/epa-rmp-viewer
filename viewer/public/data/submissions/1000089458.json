The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employee and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including:\r\n    1. Proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, \r\n    2. Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and\r\n    3. Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.\r\nEmployees tasked with critical plant operations during an evacuation receive training. The Chalk Bluff Gas Plant has 24/7 communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police, and Sheriff's Office). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, Roaring Fork conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for plant personnel."

However, the latest satellite imagery from Google Earth, the MARPLOT Map, and onsite verification, have confirmed that there are zero (0) public receptors within any worst-case scenario at the Chalk Bluff Gas Plant.\r\n\r\nAlternate Scenario:\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario for the Chalk Bluff Gas Plant is a Propane release (1,300 lbs. per minute for 10 minutes) due to a failure of the Refrigerant Accumulator, V-444, resulting in a Vapor Cloud Fire (VCF). The distance to the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) is less than 0.1 miles. There are no public receptors within this distance. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nRoaring Fork encourages employees to participate in all aspects of PSM and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan which is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Chalk Bluff Gas Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the process. These documents address (a) chemical properties and associated hazards, (b) limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and (c) equipment design basis/configuration information. \r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).

The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\nThe facility also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nRoaring Fork has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nPHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience in addition to engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards and makes recommendations to mitigate the risk. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a qualitative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. The final recommendations are tracked to closure, and resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Chalk Bluff Gas Plant periodica"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nRoaring Fork promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent re-occurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
