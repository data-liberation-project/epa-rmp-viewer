If an acidental release should occur,  the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n This facility is a retail farm supply distribution center.  As such, we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including Anhydrous Ammonia. Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck. It is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  \n\nThis facility maintains twenty-nine (29) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks  for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 127,000 pounds@ 85% full. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in two stationary storage tanks [2 @ 12,000 gallon@ 85%] on site. The maximum storage capac"

      "SummaryText": "ity of stationary storage tanks is 105,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 232,000 pounds.  The largest storage vessel at our facility contains 52,500 pounds.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the12,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 52,500 pounds. According to  modeling, the release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have an off-site impact. It should be noted that Turin  has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank. \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds. This release scenario (distance from point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have an off-site impact. It should be noted that Turin has never had a release of this type.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention R"

      "SummaryText": "ule, files Sara III (EPCRA) with proper authorities,  as well as all other applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, barriers, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.  \n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training. Topics covered in this training include; operating procedures for plant startup, plant shutdowns, filling a nurse tank, unloading a transport, emergency shutdown and  startup after emergency shutdown.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n There has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community"
