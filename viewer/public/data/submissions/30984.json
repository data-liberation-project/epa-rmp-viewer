The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Equity Elevator and Trading Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If any accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers and pumping ammonia for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 132,000 lbs. in our 30,000-gal tank and our nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst ? case release scenario and the alternate release scenario\n\na. the worst ? case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.12 miles.\nb. the alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 3 inch pipe.  The distance to the endpoint is .78 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provision of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published bye the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storag"

The five ? year accident history\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nThe facility has:\na. a written emergeny action plan, in accordane with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38:\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency plannig and community right ? to ? know information as required under SARA Title III;\nc. coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on ? going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe condition.  A recent security/safety self assessment has been performed."
