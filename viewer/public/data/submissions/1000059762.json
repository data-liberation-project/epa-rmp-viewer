This document has been prepared to satisfy the following regulation:\n\n\n\n?    Federal EPA's, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThis document contains the necessary information to satisfy the EPA Risk Management Program regulations for facilities handling regulated substances in excess of the listed threshold quantity.  Specifically, this document consists of the Executive Summary as required by 40 CFR Part 68.155 (19 CCR ?2745.3) and the RMP*eSubmit and Data Elements forms as required by 40 CFR Part 68.160 - 180 (19 CCR ?2745.4 - .8).  Finally, this document contains the certification page required by 40 CFR Part 68.185 (19 CCR ?2745.9).\n\n\n\nNOTE: The facility's charge for the May 2020 re-submittal is 13259 pounds. The original RMP*eSubmit indicated a full system potential inventory of 13,822 pounds.\n\n\n\nThis RMPlan document is the information that will be submitted to the Phoenix Fire Department as intended for public review.  The Program document is the system that supports the plan and ensures that the facility is being operated safely.

Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 30 psig on the low-pressure side of the system to 150 psig on the high side. \n\n\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and Condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The majority of the system's equipment is located in the Mechanical Equipment Area outside the north wall of the facility.  The condensers are also located in the Mechanical room and the evaporators are placed in their respective dock or storage areas. \n\n \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe attached Registration contains a summary of the Cafe Valley Bakery administrative and operational programs to prevent ammonia-related accidents and reduce potential risks.

Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Action Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Cafe Valley Bakery facility is located at 7000 W. Buckeye Rd. The facility is approximately 1.6 miles south of Interstate 10 in west Phoenix on Buckeye Rd.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is primarily industrial.\n\n\n\nThe Cafe Valley facility was constructed in 2010 with Sept 30, 2010 as the initial startup date. The primary business of this location is production of frozen bakery products.  The initial start-up charge was 9,200 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe facility now uses 13,259 pounds of ammonia in a single closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage of raw materials and various finished products.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:  The facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins \"\n\n?

IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nPrevention programs are in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  \n\n\n\nEngineering Measures: It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over pressurization. The pressure relief valves vent to a water diffusion tank designed to hold one gallon of water per pound of ammonia which could be release from the largest relief valve in one hour.  An emergency pressure control system provides redundant shutdown of compressors on high pressure and equalizes system pressures if activated.\n\n\n\nThe mechanical equipment area is equipped with an ammonia detection system designed to alarm at 25 ppm. \n\n\n\nEach cold storage room will be equipped with one or more ammonia detectors. These detectors will activate a visual and audible alarm inside and outside the room entrance at 25 ppm. In addition, at 25 ppm, the refrigeration controls will shut down the liquid feed solenoid valves to stop the flow of refrigerant into all air units in the affected room.  The detectors are monitored by an off-site security company which will notify appropriate facility management and emergency responders.\n\nThe detectors are also monitored by a master control system that sends notifications to"

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  \n\n\n\nThis Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the operator plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The operator of the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had a significant ammonia release since start-up in September 2010.  There is no accident history to report.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Hazards Review was conducted initially conducted September 3, 2010 and provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Cafe Valley facility. The last revalidation was conducted on 9/19/2016.  In addition to recommendations from the Hazard Review, the facility safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility on the safety plan/programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan developm"
