      "SummaryText": "Colonial Chemical Inc. located in rural Marion County, TN is a forerunner in the manufacture of surfactant products based on renewable ingredients.  Colonial is committed to manufacturing safe products and to protecting the safety of its employees and the community. Colonial receives epichlorohydrin, derived from plant-based glycerol, in bulk containers.  The epichlorohydrin is transferred from the bulk container to a closed atmospheric storage tank incorporating a full vapor recovery design to prevent the release of vapors.  Safety systems for epichlorohydrin include multiple layers of overfill and overpressure prevention, nitrogen inertion, remote emergency shutdown and isolation devices, interlocks/alarms, spill containment structures and an automatic foam deluge system.  Spills of epichlorohydrin can be isolated remotely and blanketed with foam to suppress the evaporation of toxic vapors.  The storage of bulk epichlorohydrin is in a dedicated containment dike remote from the manufacturing area. Piping containing epichlorohydrin is 100% within impervious containment.  \n\n\n\nOff-site consequence analysis for the hypothetical worst-case scenario involving epichlorohydrin indicates that the potential effects are limited to a small localized rural area adjacent to the Colonial facility.  Analysis of more realistic scenarios involving failure of unloading or transfer equipment shows that no hazardous exposure is expected outside of the Colonial facility. \n\n\n\nThe robust design of the safety features in the epichlorohydrin system is the result of thorough process hazard analysis and application of recognized industry best practices. The integrity of the process safety systems is maintained through management of change, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, safe operating procedures and formal training programs.  Robust design and well-trained and engaged employees following sound operating procedures result in the safe operation of the epichlorohydrin system."
