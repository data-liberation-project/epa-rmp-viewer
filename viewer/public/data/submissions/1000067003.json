The plant conditions approximately 120 to 130 million standard cubic feet (MMscfd) of field gas per day into saleable natural gas liquids and residue gas.  The primary plant operations include inlet compression, dehydration, carbon dioxide removal, natural gas liquids removal, and storage. The NGLs are delivered by pipeline. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant is to separate NGL out of the raw field gas to produce a residue gas and natural gas condensate liquid. To complete this separation, inlet gas is flown through Kutz I or Kutz II. \r\n\r\nKutz I is a refrigerated Lean Oil Absorption processing plant capable of processing 140MMSCFD, it was initially constructed in 1950. Kutz I lean oil absorption process removes and liquefies ethane, propane, butane, and natural gas condensate that is pumped to the Enterprise product line.  This plant maintains and operates three HRA 8 Clark compressors (refrigeration).\r\n\r\nKutz II is a refrigerated Turbo Expander Cryogenics Plant capable of processing 90MMSCFD, it was initially constructed in 1976.

This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the San Juan County LEPC and emergency response organizations. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Kutz Plant plans to evaluate additional engineering safeguards and continue training of employees and contractors. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulated substances."
