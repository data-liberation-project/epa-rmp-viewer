It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the ERP and drills are conducted annually.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\n\n\nThe Kutz Gas Plant provides compression, amine treatment, dehydration, extraction and natural gas liquids recovery for the San Juan and Four Corners Gathering Systems.  The plant conditions approximately 120 to 130 million standard cubic feet (MMscfd) of field gas per day into saleable natural gas liquids and residue gas.  The primary plant operations include inlet compression, dehydration, carbon dioxide removal, natural gas liquids removal, and storage. The NGLs are delivered by pipeline. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant is to separate NGL out of the raw field gas to produce a residue gas and natural gas condensate liquid. To complete this separation, inlet gas is flown through Kutz I or Kutz II. \n\n\n\nKutz I is a refrigerated Lean Oil Absorption processing plant capable of processing 140MMSCFD, it was initially constructed in 1950. Kutz I lean oil absorption process removes and liquefies ethane, propane, butane, and natural gas condensate that is pumped to the Enterprise product line.  This plant maintains and operates three HRA 8 Clark compressors (refrigeration).\n\n\n\nKutz II is a refrigerated Turbo Expander Cryogenics Plant capable of processing 90MMSCFD, it was initially constructed in 1976.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\n\n\n?Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.\n\n\n\n?Mechanic"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant is coordinated with San Juan County LEPC. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the San Juan County LEPC and emergency response organizations. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Kutz Plant plans to evaluate additional engineering safeguards and continue training of employees and contractors. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulated substances."
