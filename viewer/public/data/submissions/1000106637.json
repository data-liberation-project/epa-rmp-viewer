Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no chemical spills or critical releases within the last five years that have had any off site consequences.\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\nGPC has implemented an Emergency Response Program in the event of a regulated substance release.  Plant wide training on the Emergency Response Program is conducted with all GPC personnel annually. \n\nS.O.P.'s, standard operating procedures, and emergency procedures have been developed for each of the critical process areas. Emergency drills are conducted annually in the affected process areas. These drills involve all applicable plant operations, maintenance, and security personnel and include a follow-up critique of the drill and review/revision of procedures as warranted. These drills provide one of several means for the plant to increase safety and hazard awareness, practice emergency procedures and identify opportunities to improve communication, and execution.\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvements are constantly ongoing. Improvements are identified from review of procedures, incident reports, review of drills, review of storage, handling and safety systems by outside vendors, etc. Improving safety is a perpetual process for transportation, quality assurance, maintenance, operations, engineering, contractors, and virtually all aspects of our operation. All contractors on site must have a minimum of the 10-hr OSHA Construction certification that must be renewed every three years. All contractors must complete a safety orientation class and be badged accordingly to work on site. Safety policies and practices are continuously scrutinized for practicality and for improvement."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\nGrain Processing Corporation, GPC, uses every means at its disposal to operate a safe workplace. This includes implementing the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA PSM-Process Safety Management) and 40 CFR 68 (EPA RMP-Risk Management Plan) which are systematic approaches for chemical process hazards management designed to eliminate or minimize the potential for major catastrophes caused by the release of highly hazardous chemicals. GPC employs these measures to ensure that the means for preventing a catastrophic release, fire, or explosion are understood by all personnel onsite, and to ensure the necessary preventative measures and mitigation measures are installed and maintained. Management ensures that these measures are properly established and utilized.\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\nGPC is located in the southeast portion of the city of Muscatine, Muscatine County, Iowa. The facility covers approximately 110 acres. GPC is a corn wet milling operation. Located adjacent to the Mississippi River, GPC produces beverage and denatured ethyl alcohol, crude corn oil, conventional and modified corn starches, maltodextrins, corn syrup solids, superabsorbent polymers, and animal feed by-products. GPC's facility includes storage vessels, equipment, and processes typical of a corn wet milling plant.\n\nThe primary plant operations of concern for RMP are starch modification processes, which include the following subsystems:\n\n1. Propylene Oxide Tank Truck unloading\n\n2. Propylene oxide storage and transfer systems\n\nUse of regulated substances:\npropylene oxide is reacted with cornstarch in the modified starch area to produce modified corn starches for both food and industrial use. \n\nQuantities of all chemicals stored include:\nPropylene Oxide\nMinimum inventory    -0-\nMaximum inventory    235,507 lbs.  (85% of the capacity of the storage tank)\n\nAnother operation that is incl"
