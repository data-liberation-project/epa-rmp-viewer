This facility, centrally located near both commercial and residential properties, houses chlorine and sulfur dioxide ton containers used in the treatment of wastewater.  All containers are located within a separate chemical storage room, two of each chemical in use and two of each chemical in storage.  There are 8,000 lb of each, chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  This RMP was developed for both covered processes.\n\nAs accident prevention is considered with the utmost importance, the planning and development of this program has been met with much effort.  Although site personnel are trained in the hazards of this chemical and process and are capable of responding to incidental releases with Ruston Fire Department personnel serving as primary responders.  The Fire Department maintains a  \"B\" kit for chlorine cylinder repair.  A plan for their response in the event of an uncontrolled release has been developed \u00bf for both work day and after-hours events.  The emergency phone number for this agency is 911.  Fire Chief Donnie Watson serves as point of contact.\n\nThe City of Ruston has not had an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\n\nEmergency response has been coordinated with local responders -- Ruston Fire Department -- and the plan elements have been communicated to the Lincoln Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.  Fire Department personnel have received Hazardous Materials training.  The details of the accident prevention program were presented to the public on June 17, 1999, in  a public meeting held in Ruston.  Mock drills are coordinated and conducted with the local emergency responders.\n\nBy December 2006, this facility will have undergone a complete update including the installation of an ultraviolet disinfection system.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide in 150 lb. cylinders will be used as a back up"
