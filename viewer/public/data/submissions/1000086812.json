The pressure vessels accommodate the receipt of butane and store butane onsite for blending into gasoline which requires compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations as greater than 10,000 lbs are stored onsite.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance at this facility is butane. The equipment which handles butane includes three pressure vessels and associated piping. The pressure vessel and associated piping may contain a maximum of 1,402,000 lbs of butane.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe West Tulsa Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations,and maintenance procedures. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\n\nThe regulated butane storage/blending process in the facility is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures. The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility. There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA. The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\". The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges. Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere"

      "SummaryText": " has been no accidental releases from the butane process at the West Tulsa Facility within the past five years that resulted in offsite consequences, injuries, or significant property damage.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe West Tulsa terminal is considered a Non-Responding facility.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan. Within the past five years the butane process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule. In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThere are no planned changes to the West Tulsa butane process. As opportunities for improvement associated with this process arise at the West Tulsa Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P.\n\n"
