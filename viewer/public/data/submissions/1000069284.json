Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\r\n\r\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Central Farm Service, Clarks Grove, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance: \r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia would be approximately 250,000 pounds in three 18,000 gallon storage tanks; and approximately 140,000 pounds available capacity in various 1,450 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a semi-tanker holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct semi-annual inspections of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance found during the inspections. Visual checks are to be conducted daily at the facility. \r\n\r\n4. The Five-year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have to our knowledge:\r\n\r\na. Caused any death, injuries, or si"

The next annual emergency action plan and emergency response program training is scheduled for July 2018. Additional emergency training is also provided throughout the year at various training sessions, including but not limited to training held every fall on anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\r\n\r\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\r\n\r\nd. A Safety Data Sheet for anhydrous ammonia as part of their emergency response plan information for quick access and reference.\r\n\r\ne. A Minnesota AWAIR (A Workplace Accident and Injury Reduction) program in place and is committed to a safe working environment as well as protection of the community in which we operate.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to ensure safe operating conditions.
