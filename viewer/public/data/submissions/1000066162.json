      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Linde Gas North America, LLC, Freeport, TX, Hydrochlor Facility:\n\n\n\nSafety is the first consideration in the design and operation of this plant.  Nevertheless, there is always the possibility of equipment failure, operator error or force of nature which could cause a serious environmental problem. Hydrochlor is committed to making protection of human heath, safety and the environment the first priority. We will operate on the premise that all accidents and incidents are preventable and work toward this goal. \n\n\n\nHydrochlor will fulfill this policy commitment through the application of a comprehensive Risk Management System which will provide all stakeholders with ongoing assurance that:\n\n\n\n- Adherence to safety, heath and environmental laws, regulations, and permit requirements\n\n- Identifiable safety, heath and environmental risks associated with Hydrochlor operation are assessed and successfully managed\n\n- Systems are in place to manage change\n\n- An environmental contingency plan is in place\n\n- Emergency Response Procedures are in place\n\n- An excellent safety performance is everyone's responsibility, and it is this site policy that all employees must adopt and are encourage safe work practices and conduct for all work-related activities in an environmentally responsible manner.\n\n\n\n2. General Information of the facility:\n\n\n\nThe Hydrochlor LLC facility is a joint venture (JV) between Linde Gas North America, LLC and Versum Materials that was established for the purpose of filling tube trailers and Y-cylinders with Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride manufactured by Olin.   The process is fed by liquid hydrogen chloride from the supplier's (Olin) existing pipeline. Olin operates and maintains a sub-cooler, sump and knock-out pot on the JV site for interface with the JV transfill equipment. \n\n\n\nA Milton Roy (MR) triplex pump transfers sub-cooled liquid to tube trailers and Y-cylinders."

      "SummaryText": " The MR pump is a positive displacement pump, therefore is fitted with a variable frequency drive (VFD) and a recycle loop, controlled by discharge pressure, tied back to the Olin subcooler sump. The purpose of the recycle loop is to maintain higher discharge pressure, particularly while filling Y-cylinders. \n\n\n\nThere are two tube trailer fill stanchions, each with a truck scale, and one dump stanchion. There is an additional truck scale on site for check weighing that is not associated with dump or fill stanchions. There are four Y-cylinder fill stanchions, each with cylinder scale, and one dump stanchion. There is an additional cylinder scale on site for check weighing that is not associated with dump or fill stanchions. \n\n\n\nTube trailers have connections at both the front (liquid) and back (gas) of the tubes. There is a single manifold to connect at the rear of the tube (gas connection), shared by the two tube trailer fill stanchions, that is used for analytical sampling and testing. The Y-cylinder fill stanchions do not have separate gas and liquid manifolds, in which case the Y-cylinder is rotated to spin the dip tube for either gas or liquid connection. \n\n\n\nIn certain cases, tube trailers and Y-cylinders will be returned on site with a small heel of liquid that must be removed before re-filling the container. This liquid heel will be dumped to Olin's anhydrous HCl header, via Olin's knock-out pot on the JV site. Several times a month, tubes and cylinders will be taken out of service to have the primary vessel valve replaced. In these cases, HCl vapor that is not dumped to the anhydrous header (typically 50 psig) will be vented through an absorber on site. The absorber is essentially a liquid contactor to remove HCl vapor from a gas stream. The resulting aqueous HCl will be returned to Olin at a rate of approximately 5 gpm. The absorber will operate continuously; therefore, the concentration of HCl in the aqueous return stream will vary between 0% and 38% acid."

      "SummaryText": " \n\n\n\nAfter connections are made to the Y-cylinder or tube trailer, high pressure Nitrogen (1000 psig) will be used to insure no leaks. This Nitrogen will be vented down to the absorber. In addition to leak check, low pressure He will be used to purge lines after making connections and before line breaking, to maintain purity and prevent operator exposure, respectively. This low pressure He, (aka cycle purge) will also be vented to the absorber.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Linde facility complies with US EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal,\n\nstate, and local codes and regulations. The Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with industry standards and state law at the Linde Gas facility in Freeport, TX.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year accident history:\n\nThe Freeport, TX, Linde facility has not had an accident involving its anhydrous hydrogen chloride processes in the last five years.\n\n\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our anhydrous hydrogen chloride systems, it is Linde Gas' policy to immediately notify the Dow and the Linde Gas emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency. We have communicated this policy with the Dow. All members of the Linde emergency response team are properly trained to respond to emergencies at the facility. All employees have access to Linde emergency action plan. Emergency response training, including fire drills, is conducted annually.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety improvements are an ongoing process typically derived from employee input as well as\n\ncorporate directives.\n\n"
