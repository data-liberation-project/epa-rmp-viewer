It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Peterson Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Cherokee County, Iowa LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Brooke, Iowa location is Bob Neppl, location  manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n                      Bob Neppl, location manager\n                               WORK:    (712) 434-2297\n                               24-Hour:  (712) 295-7761\n\n                      Bruce Hinkeldey,  assistant\n                               WORK:     (712) 434-2257"

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nThe system consists of one (1)  30,000-gallon storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1).\n\nTHE WORST-CASEAND ALTERNATIVE  RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the unincorporated communities of Maple and Elkton, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility"

Finally, First Cooperative Association has extended to the Peterson Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nFirst Cooperative Association, Brooke, Iowa has experienced one (1) accidental release involving anhydrous ammonia. The release occurred on August 22, 1997. The quantity released approximated 9540 pounds. The release occurred when the seals on the main liquid transfer pump began to leak. No deaths, injuries, hospitalizations, evacuations, or shelterings-in-place occurred as a result of the release. There was some damage to the soybean crop growing in an adjacent field. In addition, the soil on-site that was potentially contaminated with anhydrous ammonia-laden water that had been sprayed over the pump while First Cooperative Association employees were shutting off the main liquid and vapor supply lines to and from the liquid pump. The Peterson Volunteer Fire Department, company officials, and a representative of the Spencer, Iowa Field Office for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources responded to the scene. In addition to Iowa Department of Natural Resources officials, the National Emergency Response Center was also notified. With the assistance of the Peterson Volunteer Fire Department, an employee of First Cooperative Association donned appropriate personal protective equipment, entered the release site, and su"

In the unlikely event that the Peterson Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Peterson location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Peterson has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Cherokee County LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nNone."
