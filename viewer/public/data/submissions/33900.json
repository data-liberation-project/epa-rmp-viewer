Among the processes required for proper treatment of potable water is the chlorination process.  The chlorination process adds chlorine gas to process water to reduce bacteria. Chlorine is received in ton containers. The chlorination process has a designated area for storage and process activities.  The process has been designed in accordance with all local, state, and federal codes and requirements. The process has a gas detection system that alarms should the concentration of chlorine reach 1.0 parts per million. The chlorination process is maintained and operated by personnel certified by the State of Wisconsin as Surface Water Treatment Plant Operators.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: the facility MAINTAINS A compliance program to meet the requirements of WI. Comm 32.27, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals for the chlorination process.  Compliance with this regulation, and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule helps to prevent the release of chlorine from this process.  Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of chlorine in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:There have been no accident or injuries related to the chlorination process during the previous five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: The Racine Utilities Water Utility's Emergency Response Plan is based upon OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans.  The plan has been coordinated with the Racine Fire Department.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  The facility personnel co"
