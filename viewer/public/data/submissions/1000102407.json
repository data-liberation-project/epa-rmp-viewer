Pell City, AL facility\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\nBenjamin Moore & Co. is committed to producing high quality products and managing all phases of its business in a manner which minimizes any adverse effects of its products and operations to the environment.  Benjamin Moore was one of the first companies to remove lead and mercury from its products and is an industry leader in the development of paints containing zero volatile organic compounds.  Benjamin Moore is a member of the American Coatings Association Inc. - Coatings Care program, which supports the coating industry's commitment to environmental protection, sustainability, product stewardship, health and safety, corporate responsibility, and the advancement of science and technology.\n\nStationary Source & Regulated Substances\nThe Benjamin Moore & Co. facility in Pell City, AL manufactures coatings such as interior and exterior paints along with the latex resin which is a component of the latex (water-based) paint.  Only one chemical on-site, vinyl acetate, is stored in a quantity above the EPA threshold quantity.  The vinyl acetate is reacted with other materials to produce a non-hazardous polymer, which forms the latex resin that later goes into latex paint.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe vinyl acetate is stored in the tank farm and used in the latex resin production facility on-site.  Both of these areas are covered by OSHA PSM and EPA RMP Level 3 regulations to ensure safe storage, handling, and processing of the materials.  To ensure safe operation of the facility, a team of engineers, operating staff and managers, along with mechanics, conduct a Hazard and Operability Study (Haz-Op) every 5 years where we look at the entire process, discuss what could go wrong.  We then rate the severity of the incident and frequency of the initiating event, then us"

These safeguards could be items such as emergency operating procedures, interlocks, preventive maintenance checks, foam sprinkler systems, relief systems, etc.  If during the review there appears to be inadequate safeguards, a mitigation plan is created to close these gaps in a timely manner.\n\n5 Year Accident History\nWe have had no accidental releases of vinyl acetate in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nIn the event of an emergency involving vinyl acetate, it is our policy to notify the Local Emergency Planning Commission, fire department, applicable environmental agencies, and the police to request that they respond to the emergency.  We will also contract the services of a professional hazardous materials response and clean-up team to aid in the remediation of the event.  In addition, we train our on-site emergency response team to 24-hour HAZWOPER operations level to provide them the knowledge to recognize an emergency situation when it occurs and respond accordingly to decrease any on-site or off-site impacts.  We conducts drills routinely with our emergency response team, and communicate changes yearly with the outside parties.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nBenjamin Moore & Company is committed to the continuous safety improvement of its processes.  Our employees at all levels are continuously critiquing our procedures, training processes, preventative maintenance program, and developing better methods of control to further improve safety at our site, while following management of change process required by OSHA PSM and EPA RMP."
