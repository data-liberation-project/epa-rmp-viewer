Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was opened for business in 1976 by two entrepreneurs.  In 1986, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was bought by First Chemical Company of Pascagoula, MS.  First Chemical Company is a subsidiary of First Mississippi Corporation, who was restructured under the name of ChemFirst Inc. in late 1996. Albemarle Corporation purchased the site in July of 2001. \n\nThe facility is designed for maximum flexibility and is continuously upgraded to ensure safe operation, minimal waste, and top efficiency.  We have more than 60,000 gallons of reactor capacity and a complete range of solids handling equipment.  The plant is especially well-equipped for complex, multi-step synthesis.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant's production operations consist of the batch production of specific and finite campaigns to produce chemicals for our customers.\n\nThe facility's Quality and Environmental management systems are ISO 9002 (Quality) and RC 14000 (Environmental and Safety ) registered.\n\nFACILITY POLICIES FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE\n\nCompany environmental and safety/health policy statements stress the importance of protecting the safety and health of our employees as well as that of the community and the public.  \"The world's natural resources of air, water, and land are finite and must be conserved and protected.  Life and health are precious and must be safeguarded.

The R&D Department reviews this and other (i.e., thermal and chemical stability) information obtained from customers, and if the information is inadequate, testing of the reaction mixtures or compounds is performed.  The Engineering Department generates a P&ID for each project so that the R&M Department can install the equipment as designed.  The Engineering Department has determined the electrical classification for the various buildings and purchases equipment which meets these requirements.  The Engineering Department designs the general ventilation systems for the production buildings and designs the local ventilation systems throughout the plant.  Design Codes and standards that are used are a combination of Albemarle, Tyrone Plant requirements,  ASME Boiler Codes, NFPA Codes, and other applicable codes and standards.  The Engineering Department reviews the process and generates a short process description and block flow diagram.  It also reviews proposed chemical usage and determines the maximum inventory levels.  The Engineering Department reviews process chemistry and determines the corrosivity of raw materials and reaction mixtures.  They then select the proper equipment which will withstand the corrosive effect of the various chemicals or mixtures.

The PM system is also a part of the ISO 9002 and 14001 systems, and these systems are each audited two times a year by third party auditors.  The R&M Department conducts an annual shutdown each year in which additional equipment is inspected and/or tested.  Certain equipment may also be inspected and/or tested by contractors.
