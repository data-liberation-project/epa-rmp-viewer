      "SummaryText": "E.W Brown Generation Station, Kentucky Utilities, Mercer County, Kentucky, operates an inlet cooling system. This system uses approximately 32,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in two separate ice thermal storage tanks. Engineers and company officials have reviewed relevant data from other existing systems to assist them with engineering design and mitigation techniques. This process is repquired to comply with 40 CFR part 68, Clean Air Act Amendments, Risk Management Plans. KU has developed a Risk Management and Process Safety Management Program to inform employees and management of the required procedures to maintain a safe operation.\n\n\n\nThis System is a closed-loop system with automatic shutdown activation. KU has trained process operators and emergency response team members should an emergency occur. Procedures that are in place to assist with quick mitigation of this type of release include: two operators performing this function so that if release occurs, isolation upstream can occur, radio communication to the control panel operator; trained emergency response personnel; and control panel operators recognizing a change in pressure. This process is also designed with an automatic shutdown system. Control panels will be monitored by trained personnel aiding in a quick response. Equipment used to process, store, and handle ammonia are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, KU added a Selective Catalytic Reduction System to the Unit 3 coal fired combustion process.  The Unit 3 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Process is a process which uses anhydrous ammonia in the presence of a catalyst to reduce nitrous oxides, a hazardous emission in the power plant flue gases, to form non-polluting nitrogen and water.  The BR3 SCR process consists of the following steps:\n\n\n\n?    Liquefied anhydrous ammonia, gas under pressure from its container, is delivered to the facility in a tank truck.  \n\n?    Liquefied anhydrous ammonia"

      "SummaryText": " is pumped from the transport vehicle into one of the two 34,000 gallon storage tanks.  \n\n?    Liquefied anhydrous ammonia is stored in the storage tanks.  \n\n?    Liquefied anhydrous ammonia is pumped from one of the storage tanks to the injectors.\n\n?    Liquefied anhydrous ammonia is fed through the injector into a dilution air flow.\n\n?    Pressure relief valves can vent small quantities of anhydrous ammonia gas when valves in the system malfunction.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia Unit 3 SCR system is a series of interconnected vessels and piping, that store and pump anhydrous ammonia to the SCR injectors.  The injectors release the anhydrous ammonia as a gas into an air flow which is in turn, carried into the flue gases.  SCR equipment includes high pressure storage tanks, pumps, piping, instruments, controls, and valves. The quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the SCR system is estimated at 290,950 pounds when the system is completely (85%) filled. The anhydrous ammonia process begins with the delivery of the anhydrous ammonia at the facility until the anhydrous ammonia is converted into ammonia gas at the injectors.\n\n  \n\n\n\nKU's computerized maintenance management system enables personnel to provide continuous maintenance. The maintenance system is computerized and encompasses all phases of maintenance management including problem reporting, resouce scheduling, generation of prevention maintenance work orders, equipment database and complete equipment history. Safe operation of the system is a common goal for all E.W. Brown employees. This effort is supported through programs described previously and the involvement of plant management in development and implementation of the Process Safety and Risk Management Programs."
