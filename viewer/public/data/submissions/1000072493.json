The latest PHA was conducted on March 3rd, 2018.\r\n\r\n- Operating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Campo Viejo site maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tag out; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\r\n\r\n- Training - A training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Initial training on gas plant operations is provided, and refresher training will be conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed. Employee training is documented and records of training will be maintained onsite for at least three years. \r\n\r\n- Mechanical Integrity - Written procedures are in place for maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the"

The plant also incorporates quality assurance measures to ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for the process application for which they will be used.\r\n\r\n-Management of Change - Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  These procedures are updated as needed.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\n-Pre-startup Reviews - Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes will be conducted as a regular practice at the Campo Viejo site.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\n-Compliance Audits - Regularly scheduled audits will be conducted to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits will be carried out by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and conducted at least once every three years.

The Campo Viejo site has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by a Prevention Program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is Stakeholder's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, Stakeholder has a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) in which a Management Team is form that has an Incident Commander to facilitate the response and ensure overall safety during mitigation measures. The ERP details the steps to take in case of an accidental release as well as the reporting guidelines to State agencies and LECP.   Stakeholder has also coordinated response with Plains Fire Department.  The most recent review of the ERP was done on October 2, 2018.\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\nThe Campo Viejo site includes front-end liquids handling, an amine treater and acid gas injection well, a cryogenic processing plant with the capacity to process 60 million cubic feet per day, and a nitrogen rejection unit. Residue gas from the process is compressed for sales and natural gas liquids are pumped to a pipeline sales point.

RMP*Comp&trade; was used to calculate the distances to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint.
