The facility includes front-end liquids handling, an amine treater and acid gas injection well, a cryogenic processing plant with the capacity to process 60 million cubic feet per day, and a nitrogen rejection unit. \n\nA.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nIt is Stakeholder's policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Campo Viejo site has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by a Prevention Program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is Stakeholder's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, Stakeholder has a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) in which a Management Team is form that has an Incident Commander to facilitate the response and ensure overall safety during mitigation measures. The ERP details the steps to take in case of an accidental release as well as the reporting guidelines to State agencies and LECP.   Stakeholder has also coordinated response with Plains Fire Department.  The most recent review of the ERP was done on October 2, 2018.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Campo Viejo site includes front-end liquids handling, an amine treater and acid gas injection well, a cryogenic processing plant with the capacity to process 60 million cubic feet per day, and a nitrogen rejection unit.

OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nSince there are no toxic chemicals handled above the threshold quantities at the Campo Viejo facility, the Offsite Consequence Analysis was carried out only for the flammable mixtures. \n\na.    Worst Case Scenario:\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumes that the vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (Product Surge Tank (PV-1422) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  RMP*Comp&trade; was used to calculate the distances to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint.  As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on the predominant regulated flammable component of the mixture, which in this case is ethane. Meteorological conditions for worst-case scenarios are defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mi/h).\n\nThe entire weight of the mixture is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. The scenario involved an uncontrolled release of 130,078 lb.  RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.4 miles to the 1 psi endpoint.  \n\n\n\nb.

Meteorological conditions were given in the RMP*Comp program and followed the methodology described in section 10 of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis for rural areas.\n\n\n\nC.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA. The Campo Viejo site is a PSM-covered facility and, as such, it has a viable process safety program. Workers and their representatives are consulted and have access to information regarding all PSM elements. Complete and accurate information on the process technology, process equipment, and hazardous characteristics and physical properties of all chemicals and intermediates for all covered processes is maintained. \n\n\n\n- Process Safety Information - Campo Viejo site maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's).\n\n\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The HAZOP method is used to perform these e"

The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of no more than 5 years. All findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The latest PHA was conducted on March 3rd, 2018.\n\n\n\n- Operating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Campo Viejo site maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tag out; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\n\n\n- Training - A training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Initial training on gas plant operations is provided, and refresher training will be conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed. Employee training is documented and records of training will be maintained onsite for at least three years. \n\n\n\n- Mechanical Integrity - Written procedures are in place for maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the "
