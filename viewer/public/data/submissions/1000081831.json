After the operating procedures are completed, they will be published to the company's electronic web-based system and used in the operations training program.  \r\n \r\nManagement of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):\r\nImprovements to the MOC procedure and associated checklists are in progress to capture all process related changes.  Requirements for the identification, evaluation, control, and authorization of modifications to plant design and operations prior to the implementation to ensure that the risk of new or existing hazards are properly managed is available to all personnel.  Extensive PSSR checklists for applicable disciplines (electrical, instrumentation, procedures, etc.) have been developed and implemented.  These checklists are Appendices to the Company's MOC procedure and are available online from the company's electronic web-based process library. \r\n \r\nMechanical Integrity (MI):\r\nA third-party contractor has developed global WTG MI procedures.  In addition to the ultrasonic thickness testing program already in practice at Sonora, a complete third-party MI gap assessment was recently completed.  The identified MI gaps have been addressed and are being used to develop comprehensive inspection standards and procedures along with a specialized inspection program structured specifically for Sonora.  The Sonora MI program has been designed and implemented as of July 2019.\r\n \r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nWTG investigates all PSM incidents.  Throughout the PSM program assessment process, incident investigation procedures are being reviewed and will be updated as necessary.  A mix of WTG personnel will be provided investigation methodology training to further enhance the program and ensure root cause is consistently identified.
