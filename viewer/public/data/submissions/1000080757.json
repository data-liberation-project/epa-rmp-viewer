Due diligence towards employee and environmental safety as the primary concerns has been extended throughout the design of our resin plant.  Our goal being to make the handling of these potentially dangerous processes as safe as possible and minimize the risk to our employees, the environment and other public receptors.\n\nThe only PSM covered chemical in this process is formaldehyde solution.  Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and flammable.\n\nOther hazardous chemicals used in the process but not covered by the PSM are acetone, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide solution (caustic) and acetic acid.\n\nIn the process formaldehyde and acetone are reacted in the presence of sodium hydroxide to form a resin polymer chain.  Once the polymer chain is formed residual formaldehyde in the resin is removed by the addition of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide.  Further formaldehyde reduction is obtained from the addition of other non-hazardous chemicals.  The final resin solution has no detectable formaldehyde.\n\nThe process contains many safety features to limit and/or prevent accidental release of chemicals.  Both internal and external to the building organic vapor monitors are in place which will detect the presence of formaldehyde, acetone or acetic acid.  These detectors alert the operators in the control room to unintended releases.  Each storage vessel and reactor are equipped with high level switches which automatically shutdown any feed into the vessels when tripped.  This prevents overflow.    Any pressure built up in the system can be safely vented to a thermal combustor to prevent unintended vapor release.  Additionally, from a remotely located control room the entire process can be operated.  This includes opening/closi"

      "SummaryText": "ng of valves, running pumps and agitators.  These are just a few of the defenses in place to limit/prevent accidental release.\n\nIn the event of a formaldehyde solution release, the floors of the resin plant building are sloped to send all chemicals to an inside sump which overflows into the outside containment dike.  This dike is also tied to the outside tanker offloading containment pad.  Regardless of where the release begins, if sufficient in size it will ultimately be contained within the containment dike which is equipped at the ready with a pump system designed to safely remove liquids within the dike to either a bulk tanker or IBCs.  \n\nIn the event of a formaldehyde solution release HarperLove will act as a non-responding stationary source.  Our local fire department will provide the response.  HarperLove employees will provide support duties such as remote closure of valves to minimize the release.  Actual site remediation will be conducted in coordination with the fire department and a third-party contractor who has the appropriate training and experience for such activities.\n\nIn the last 5 years there has been one release of a PSM covered chemical on 2/10/22.\n\n"
