The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\n        An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n    4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n                The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and     Handling\n    of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia. The OSHA Standard     is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3.(b).\n5.    Five-Year Accident History \n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge have there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, property damage, or environmental damage.\n6.    Emergency Action Plan\n    The facility has:\n    a. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n    b.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of Sully Cooperative Exchange - Newton. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
