      "SummaryText": "The Hutchinson Water Treatment Center is a reverse osmosis water treatment facility which supplies potable drinking water to the residents of Hutchinson, Kansas.  It is located at 803 E. 23rd Avenue in the middle of town near a mix of residential and commercial land uses as well as the Kansas State Fairgrounds.  This Risk Management Plan covers the chlorination cylinders and equipment within the facility which will provide disinfection for the water supply.  At any time, the facility could house up to four one-ton chlorine cylinders and ten one hundred and fifty pound cylinders.  The one-ton cylinders are used at the treatment facility.The one hundred and fifty pound cylinders are stored at the facility for emergency stand-by use to chlorinate wells equipped to provide water to the distribution system in case of a power outage\r\n\r\nThe Hutchinson Water Treatment Center has incorporated various safety measures to prevent the accidental release of chlorine.  The chlorine storage and disinfection rooms are isolated from the rest of the facility.  Access is limited to the outside doors which are locked at all times.  A gas detection system is in place in both the chlorine storage and disinfection rooms. Both have mechanical ventilation to a chlorine scrubber.  An alarm system, with emergency power, automatically notifies emergency personnel in the event of a leak.  Each room also has a fire sprinkler system, and employees have been trained in the safe and practical use of the personal protective equipment and safety protocols.\r\n\r\nIn case of an accidental release, local police and fire units will be dispatched to the treatment facility.  Emergency Action Procedures (EAP) will be utilized as described in the Emergency Response Program (ERP), and City staff will provide assistance to the responders to the best of their ability in these emergency situations."
