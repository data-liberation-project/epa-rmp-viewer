Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nBraskem America Seadrift Operations is committed to operating and maintaining our polypropylene manufacturing process in a safe and responsible manner.  We have developed and implement programs to safeguard the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  Our programs not only satisfy applicable standards imposed by government agencies, such as those of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), but also adhere to Braskem America's corporate requirements.  We review and, as appropriate, update our Process Hazard Analysis periodically to ensure that process hazards are properly identified, understood, and adequately mitigated.  We also conduct other systematic internal evaluations to ensure the proper maintenance of policies and mitigation controls designed to prevent accidents and releases.  Primary responsibility for safe operation of the facility resides with the facility manager, but this responsibility is shared broadly with all employees through participation in safety related teams, projects, evaluations, and other activities, and through adherence to established policies and procedures.\r\n\r\n2. Description of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nBraskem America Seadrift Operations manufactures polypropylene.  Our final product is transported in railcars or trucks in the form of small pellets which are inert, non-toxic, non-hazardous, and do not burn readily.  Propylene is our primary raw material.  Propylene is flammable and potentially explosive if mixed with air in sufficient concentration, and has similar characteristics to propane.  The inventories of propylene and propane in our process are each above the RMP reporting threshold.  Inventories of other flammable materials in our process, such as methane, ethane, ethylene, and hydrogen"

The protection layers that are identified are maintained in place to ensure adequate protection is available.\r\nOperating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate the process.\r\nOperator Training / Certification Program:  A formal training and testing program is used to ensure that operators have proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to take responsibility for operation of the process.\r\nTechnical Staff Training and Support:  Trained technical staff are consistently available to support operations.\r\nMaintenance Procedures:  Specific procedures are used for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely.\r\nMechanical Integrity Program:  Vessels and other process equipment are periodically tested and inspected to ensure safe operation of process equipment, following recognized industry standards and governmental requirements.\r\nManagement of Change:  A management system is used to ensure that facility modifications will be safe to operate.\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews:  Reviews are conducted prior to start-up of new or modified processes.\r\nIncident Investigation:  Accidents and"

Therefore, with respect to actions, evaluations and other information relevant risk management planning (RMP) for the process unit, any such activity performed or occurring prior to October 1, 2011 did not occur during the period of Braskem ownership.\r\n\r\nBased on information available to Braskem, during the last five years, the facility has not had any accident or incident involving an RMP regulated chemcial that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\r\n\r\n - Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\r\n - Plans governing evacuation and shelter-in-place, and accounting for personnel after an incident\r\n - Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment\r\n - Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public\r\n - Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements \r\n\r\nThe Seadrift Site maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The emergency response squad trains and conducts drills to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.\r\n\r\nThe Seadrift Site emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed Seadrift Site emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Calhoun County Emergency Planning Committee and the community.

Braskem's Acquisition of Facility\r\n\r\nRelative to Braskem's development and implementation of its risk management planning (RMP) program, and specifically with respect to its prevention program, Braskem acquired the relevant process operation from Dow Chemical Company, effective October 1, 2011.  Therefore, with respect to actions, evaluations and other information relevant to RMP for the process unit, any such activity performed or occurring prior to October 1, 2011 did not occur during the period of Braskem ownership.  Nonetheless, to the extent that the prior owner of the process operation conducted any relevant evaluation, including a process hazard assessment, with respect to the process, Braskem regards such evaluation as continuing to be applicable to the process operation, since the equipment and process activities have (for purposes relevant to RMP) been retained in all material respects since the date of Braskem's initial ownership.  Therefore, in providing within this electronic submittal information responsive to specific inquiries regarding prior dates on which certain relevant events occurred, Braskem identifies, where appropriate, the date of such event even if prior to Braskem's initial ownership to the extent that such event or activity remains relevant for RMP purposes to Braskem's on-going operation of the regulated process."
