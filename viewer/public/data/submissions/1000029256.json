      "SummaryText": "NuChem Ltd (NCL) is a retail fertilizer facility.  The materials considered hazardous at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia (a 20% or more solution of ammonia in water).  The facility has aqua ammonia tanks, totaling 960,000 gallons and storage tanks for other fertilizers that are not considered hazardous under provisions of the Risk Management Plan.  NCL is equipped to receive anhydrous ammonia by rail or truck and to load out aqua ammonia from storage to trucks for use by the farmers as farm fertilizers.  It is NCL policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state and national standards relating to handling, anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  In the past five years there has been one employee injury accident, but no releases with off-site consequences.  Specific features employed to minimize the impact of accidental releases include:  1).   Pressure relief valves on the ammonia converters to prevent catastropic rupture due to overpressure.  2).  Diking around the storage tanks to contain any liquid spills.  To further ensure safe operation, NCL employees are trained in safe procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  NCL maintains an active liason with the LaCrosse Volunteer Fire Department in the event of an emergency.  As required by the EPA, NCL has analyzed the worst possible scenarios for anhydrous ammonia in railcars that may be at the facility.  For anhydrous ammonia, the worst possible scenario would be the release of the contents of an entire railcar.  According to EPA's RMP*Comp(TM), the effect of the worst case scenario for ammonia, would extend for 6.9 miles and would include the Port of Whitman County Central Ferry Industrial Park, residences and the Central Ferry State Park.  It is extremely unlikely that the EPA's worst case scenaio will ever occur.  A more probable, also highly unlikely, event would be a hose breakage due to the operators failure to uncouple before pulling away"

For anhydrous ammonia, the effect would extend 0.1 miles and would not include any off-site impacts.  For aqua ammonia, a liquid spill of the largest tank would be contained in the secondary containment, which could include a vapor plume up to 4.7 miles.\n\n\n\n"
