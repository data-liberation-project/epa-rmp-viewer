This approach includes training programs for personnel; programs to guarantee safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Badger Wash Gas Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the Badger Wash Gas Plant.  Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are typically followed.  The emergency response policy of Crescendo Energy, LLC. involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and comply with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  The goal of the spill policy of Crescendo Energy, LLC. is to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and that will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:  The primary activity at the Facility is the removal of liquid hydrocarbons, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide from a natural gas stream.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold.  There are several flammable regulated chemicals typically stored at the Facility.  The flammable regulated chemicals are present in the NGL produced and stored at the Facility.  The NGL is commonly known as \u00bfcondensate\u00bf, an aliphatic hydrocarbon mixture containing several flammable substances.  There are no regulated toxic s"

The Facility handles and stores the flammable substances listed above in sufficient quantities to exceed this threshold quantity.  The Facility stores up to a maximum of 27,120 gallons of condensate in above ground storage tanks and vessels.  The largest storage vessel contains a maximum of approximately 132,750 pounds of regulated flammable chemicals. \n\n Worst Case Release Scenario:  The RMP*COMPTM program developed by the CAMEO team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the Environmental Protection Agency was applied for the worst case release scenario (WCRS).  The worst-case release scenario analysis was reviewed and a new analysis performed as part of the update to this RMP.  The worst-case scenario analysis should be reviewed at least once every five years, or sooner if changes in the regulated processes or stored quantities occur.  The worst-case scenario was assumed to be the release of the total maximum volume of the 22,500-gallon condensate storage vessel forming a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits which then detonates.  For flammable substances, the endpoint is an overpressure condition of 1 pound per square inch (psi) for vapor cloud explosions.  Using the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure and the data contained in the RMP*COMPTM program, the WCRS distance was calculated at 0.41 mile from the Facility.  Based on measurements taken from the Facility and surrounding area, and a visual survey of the adjacent properties within a 0.41-mile radius of the facility, the population within the WCRS area is estimated to be zero (0).  There are no nearby public receptors, as defined in 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.41 mile of the Facility.  Environmental receptors,"

Figure 2 shows the Facility relative to the WCRS maximum distance area depicted by a circle with a radius of 0.41 mile centered on the Facility.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario:  The EPA document Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis was used to determine the consequences of an Alternative Case Release Scenario (ACRS) for the Facility.  The ACRS was selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  The ACRS represents a release that: 1) might occur at the Facility; and/or 2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  The ACRS is the rupture of a truck loading/transport hose between the truck and the NGL loading pumps.  This scenario assumes that the regulated flammable substance (propane) is released from the ruptured hose for 30 minutes until Facility personnel detect the release and isolate the ruptured section.  The released condensate forms a vapor cloud, resulting in an explosion.  The ACRS analysis should be reviewed at least once every five years, or sooner if changes in the regulated processes or stored quantities occur.  The maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure was determined to be 0.29 mile from the Facility.  Based on measurements taken from the Facility and surrounding area, and a visual survey of the adjacent properties within a 0.29-mile radius of the facility, the population within the ACRS area is estimated to be zero (0).
