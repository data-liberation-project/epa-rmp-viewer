A pipe fracture occured in an ammonia line located on the roof of the building.  Approximately 125 pounds was released during a six-hour period.  The pipe run that failed was replaced with a loop system so that no ammonia remains stationary in the pipe run.  This design change removed the possibility of a release resulting from similar circumstances.\n\nF) The emergency response program.\n\nThe plan calls for production employees to evacuate the building in the event of a release that warrants evacuation in response to training received to comply with 29 CFR 1910.38.  Refrigeration pesonnel have been trained to respond and stop a leak in the ammonia system as required by 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  The plan calls for coordination with the Harris County Local Emergency Planning Committee, through the 911 emergency service, and the National Response Center (1-800-424-8802) should the release have off-site impact, a reportable quantity (RQ) is released (100 pounds), or additional assistance is otherwise required.\nAn on-site health clinic is staffed during all production hours"

Administrative controls to mitigate a release such as emergency shut down procedures have been developed, and the operators have been trained on those procedures.  This scenario is required by EPA to assume unfavorable atmospheric conditions such as a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an atmospheric stability class of F.  The affected area would find an endpoint at 1.60 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario is based on a more realistic release from a pipe leak in the compressor room.  This release would be mitigated by the building structure and the emergency shut down procedures which have been developed and implemented.  This scenario assumes more realistic atmospheric conditions such as a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second and an atmospheric stability class of D.  The affected area would find an endpoint at 0.20 miles.\n\nD) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility has adopted a Level 3 Prevention Program.\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted using the What If/Checklist method.\nProcess controls"
