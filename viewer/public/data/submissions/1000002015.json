As part of this commitment, NewPage has established procedures to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facilities.  NewPage's Water Quality Center (WQC) has developed a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (the RMP rule) and helps to manage the risks of the covered substances and processes.  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan describing the risk management program at WQC.  This document is intended to satisfy the risk management plan requirements of the RMP rule.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nNewPage continues a commitment to the environment as it strives to prevent pollution and achieve the objective of operating facilities with minimal environmental impact.  The corporate sustainable development report is publicly available on NewPage\u00c2\u00bfs Internet website.  As part of its safety first objective, NewPage will strive to minimize environmental, health, and safety risks to its employees and the communities in which it operates by employing safe technologies and operating procedures.  NewPage will be constantly prepared for emergencies.  NewPage will continually inform its employees and public of its progress in safety and environmental issues.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nNewPage is headquartered in Miamisburg, Ohio, an area known for its rich heritage in the paper industry and for providing a workforce with a strong work ethic.  NewPage has approximately 8,500 employees in various locations across the United States and Canada.  NewPage is the largest coated paper manufacturer in North America, based on production capacity, with $4.7 billion in pro forma net sales for the y"

      "SummaryText": "ear ended December 31, 2007.  The company's product portfolio is the broadest in North America and includes coated freshsheet, coated groundwood, supercalendered, newsprint and specialty papers.  These papers are used for coporate collateral, commercial printing, magazines, catalogs, books, coupons, newspapers, inserts, packaging applications and direct mail advertising.\n\nNewPage operates paper mills located in Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nova Scotia, and Wisconsin.  Ten of these paper mills are at least partially integrated mills, meaning that they produce paper, pulp, and energy.  Most of the energy produced at these mills is for internal use.  We have a total combined  annual production capacity of approximately 5.5 million short tons of paper, including approximately 4.3 million short tons of coated paper, approximately 920,000 short tons of uncoated paper and approximately 300,000 short tons of specialty paper, as well as approximately 3.2 million short tons of pulp.\n\nNewPage uses third-party certified management systems as day-to-day operations tools for continuous improvement in the areas of product and service quality, environment and occupational health and safety.  Mills have ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and/or OHSAS 18001 certifications.\n\nWQC is a wastewater treatment plant owned and operated by NewPage in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin.  This facility treats wastewater generated by the pulp and paper mill operations in the Wisconsin Rapids area.\n\nAmmonia (with a concentration of 20% or greater) is the only chemical regulated by the RMP rule that is stored or handled at this facility with a concentration greater than or equal to the concentration de minimis level and a total quantity greater than or equal to the threshold quantity.  The aqueous ammonia is stored in a horizontal aboveground tank with a design capacity of 18,000 gallons.  The ammonia solution has a concentration of 29.4% by weight ammonia.

The worst case scenario for ammonia would be a liquid spill and vaporization from the 26,333 lb-tank (18,000 gallons).  An alternative release scenario is not required for this program level 1 process.  Aqueous ammonia is a toxic liquid and is used as a nutrient for the wastewater treatment plant micro-organisms.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of its corporate environmental policy, NewPage will continue to protect the environment and the health and well-being of fellow employees and communities by monitoring existing facilities to ensure that they meet all legal requirements through the use of safe technologies and operating procedures.\n\nWQC complies with the prevention and emergency response procedures from all applicable regulations.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents at the Water Quality Center in the past five years that resulted in any adverse onsite or offsite impacts.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nNewPage has a spill reporting policy that addresses the notification requirements in the event of an accidental release.  The spill reporting policy also identifies contacts and notification responsibilities. \n\nWQC has a written emergency response procedure to respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS \n\nThis facility will undergo regular scheduled maintenance and update to meet any new or revised applicable regulation and industry standard to continue to operate safely.\n."
