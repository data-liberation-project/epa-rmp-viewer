              "Description": "LAYERS OF PROTECTION\nPPG has developed numerous layers of protection to reduce the likelihood of accidents and releases.  These layers of protection have three core guidelines:  \n7 design for safety, \n7 achieve consistent excellent operations and \n7 uphold effective maintenance.  \n\nEMPLOYEES\nPPG employees are the most important component of these layers.  Employees design, operate and maintain our chemical manufacturing processes.  Employees strive to make continuous improvements to ensure that systems and equipment are working properly.  Skilled maintenance technicians are used to repair the equipment properly and to diagnose potential problems before a breakdown occurs.\n\nCODES AND CONTROLS\nThe prevention program utilized by PPG is implemented by using national codes and standards to design each and every process we operate.  PPG also uses state-of-the-art computer controls to give us optimum operating capabilities and prevention techniques designed for safety.  Emergency shutdown systems are designed for each process to automatically shut down equipment should an upset occur.  Every process has been reviewed to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and compliance is re-certified on a continual basis.\n\nPROCEDURES AND TRAINING\nPPG maintains excellent operations as another key layer of protection against a release or spill.  These operations include up-to-date operating procedures, continuous operator training and safety reviews of operation changes.  \n\nSAFE WORK PERMITS \nAdditionally, PPG supports effective maintenance as a key layer of protection.  This is achieved by using skilled maintenance personnel to perform all maintenance activities.  As part of the safety preplanning activities for plant maintenance, PPG enforces safe work procedures such as safe work permits, hot work permits, excavation permits, confined space permits, lockout-tagout procedures and roof work permits\n\nPREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE\nAnother proactive maintenance program used by PPG is our preventative maintenance program.  PPG associates manage this program using a computer software program called MAXIMO.  This software program produces maintenance work orders at a predetermined frequency for all process equipment.  Skilled maintenance technicians complete the work order by inspecting and replacing critical equipment as required, therefore preventing a spill or release.  \n\nMONITORING AND DETECTION EQUIPMENT\nPPG has several chlorine, phosgene and carbon monoxide monitors throughout the Optical Process area.  These monitors provide early warning to operations of a release or spill so that it can be mitigated immediately.  Finally, PPG operators, engineers, supervisors and managers inspect equipment, piping and instruments as part of their operational routine to add another layer of protection to PPG's accident prevention and chemical safety program.",

BARBERTON PLANT\nThe PPG Industries, Inc. facility in Barberton, Ohio, manufactures optical products, fine chemicals and silica products.  Examples of these products include:\n7 Plastic resins - used by customers to make eyewear lenses like Transitions. photochromic  lenses;\n7 Chloroformates - used by customers to make medicines and chemicals used by farmers;\n7 Silicas - used by customers to flatten and thicken paints and varnishes; \n7 Teslin. - a synthetic printing sheet used by our customers to make items such as menus, \n   identification cards, labels and children's books; and\n7 Safety films and coatings - found in commercial and military aircraft windows.\nThe Optical Products process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Planning regulation.  The six chemicals regulated by the EPA and used at the Barberton facility include phosgene, chlorine, allyl alcohol, n-propyl chloroformate, ammonia and isopropyl chloroformate.  These chemicals are used in making plastic resins for eyewear lenses, medicines and chemicals used by farmers. \n\nPOLICIES:  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nThe PPG Barberton facility complies with Occupational Safety & Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule (29 CFR 1910.119), applicable Ohio and federal EPA regulations, and applicable Coast Guard and Department of Transportation requirements.  PPG also follows the Responsible Care. Codes of Management Practice, including the Responsible Care. Community Awareness Code of Management Practice, and PPG's own Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Policy to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG's CAER Policy requires each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.  All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environmen"

Trained personnel are the key to a safely designed, a safely operated and a safely maintained plant.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used.  These standards include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, flammable and toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, a fire water system and Y2K compliant computer controls for the processes.  Employees at the facility receive job-appropriate training.  Safety, environmental, operating and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates, as appropriate.  Also, the Barberton facility uses maintenance and inspection programs that are designed to minimize the possibility of equipment, piping or control failures. These programs include procedures such as X-ray testing and thickness measurements.\n \nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed for each of the six toxic chemicals in the Barberton facility.  EPA rules require that a worst-case scenario be analyzed which would involve the highly unlikely release in ten minutes of the entire contents of the largest storage container.  Based on off-site consequence look-up tables and EPA guidelines and specified assumptions, the least-likely release scenario of phosgene would cause an off-site impact.  PPG-Barberton has no flammable chemicals to report as required by the EPA Risk Management Planning regulations. \n\nAlternative-case release scenarios, or planning-case scenarios was developed for phosgene, chlorine, allyl alcohol, n-propyl chlor"

These scenarios followed the guidelines provided by EPA and off-site consequence look-up tables to perform the end-point calculations.  The local emergency planning committee and office of emergency management will use the planning-case scenario information, along with PPG experts, to develop emergency response plans, train responders, perform practice drills and maintain the appropriate equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Barberton facility has had two accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.  In July 1994, a pipe failure caused a mixture of water, ammonia and phosgene to be released to the air.  As a precautionary measure, PPG asked safety officials to evacuate nearby homes and multi-family housing units downwind of the release.  No one was injured, however, some residents, members of safety forces and PPG employees were checked at a local hospital and released.  The second release occurred in September 1998.  A pipeline leak caused a release of chlorine.  No one off-site was injured during this incident and there was no off-site impact.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nPPG personnel are trained and ready to respond to emergencies. The local fire department personnel and other safety forces are prepared to help if needed.  Operators, supervisors and maintenance mechanics are trained in responding to various emergencies.  PPG's response plans are shared with local fire and police departments and other emergency responders.  PPG conducts emergency practice drills with its employees and local safety forces.  In addition, special emergency response equipment is located throughout the plant.  Emergency equipment is inspected and tested on a regular basis so that it is ready at all times.  Sophisticated alarms alert PPG-Barberton personnel of a spill or release.  If necessary, local officials will notify citizens b"
