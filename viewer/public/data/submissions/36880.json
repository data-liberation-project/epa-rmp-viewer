Safety is an important part of the operations and procedures carried out in the facility.  There is a Safety person employed whose responsibility includes scheduling safety training for all employees at the facility.\n\nThe Southstar Logistics, Inc. facility located in Keller, Texas is a warehouse for both non-refrigerated and refrigerated products.  Approximately 235,000 square feet of the entire facility is for the storage of refrigerated products.  The refrigerated products are usually held for a few days to a few weeks before being shipped to various Grocery stores throughout the greater Dallas Fort Worth area.  The facility and the refrigeration ammonia system is specifically designed with many different rooms and temperatures to maintain the highest quality of products, and their shelf life.   The refrigertion system contain approximately 55,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia used in the mechanical refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system maintains storage room temperatures ranging from +55F to -10F.  Glycol is also chilled for the banana ripening process.  \n\nThe Southstar Logistics facility implements the OSHA Process Safety Management program, which requires extensive industry standards for maintenance, operation, training and documentation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The ammonia refrigertion is a closed loop mechanical system with multiple and redundant systems to prevent or minimize a potential release. Operators are trained on how to maintain and ensure the systems safe and continued operation.\n\nThe system has been in operation since 1983.  There are no reportable releases during the last five-years. \n\nBetween the Maintenance Manager and the Safety person, all of the refrigeration operators obtain or are"

There is also a specific Emergency Response Plan that among other things includes procedures to deal specifically with the possible ammonia release.  Since the system has not had any ammonia releases, tabletop drills and other non-release practice scenarios are carried out on an annual basis.\n\nAs indicated by periodic system inspections, worn or damaged equipment is replaced as needed.  For example the facility is currently in the process of replacing the aging evaporative condensers with same but new condensers."
