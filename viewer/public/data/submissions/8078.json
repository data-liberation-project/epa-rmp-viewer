Information includes information pertaining to \nthe hazards of ammonia, process technology, process \nequipment, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe stationary source is the Battle Creek Farmers Cooperative - Osmond, \nNE anhydrous ammonia storage facility.  The largest ammonia \nprocess group (e.g., largest storage tank or group of interconnected \ntanks) is a railcar that has a storage capacity of 33,400 water gallons \n(156,000 pounds) parked at a rail siding at the facility.  \n\nThe railcars are used when an outside contractor converts anhydrous ammonia\n(using a T-reactor) and other items into 10-34-00 fertilizer at this facility.\nThis process is in operation about 12 days per year.\n\nThe total ammonia stationary storage capacityconcists of:\n\n    up to three railcars with 33,400 water gallons of storrage \n(468,000 for three railcars) for temporary storage capacity\n\n    30,000 water gallons and an 18,000 water gallon storage tanks\nor 224,000 pounds of permanent storage capacity\n\nThe facility also stores numerous smaller transportable tanks (nurse tanks) \nthat are actually used in the fertilizer application process.  \n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario \nper hazardous substance handled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program \napplicability.  Battle Creek Co-op has chosen to use the DEGADIS+ \nrelease model to determine offsite impacts.\n\n\nFor this facility, a worst-case release would occur in the event that \nthe largest ammonia and propane storage tanks would rupture and the \nentire contents would be released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  The \nworst-case scenario requires a ground-level release height (0 feet).  \nAmmonia release rate for use of DEGADIS+ is presented below:\n\n\nSample Ammonia Endpoint Calculation\n\nGiven:       Storage Tank Capacity is 33,400 water gallons\n             ANSI K61.1 fillin"

The alternative \nrelease scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines \nprovided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\n\nThe alternative scenarios chosen for this facility involves a release \nbecause of a sudden split in the hose during transfer at the largest \npermanent storage tank.  While this \nscenario is still unlikely because the transfer hoses used have \nmultiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless steel wire \nunderneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it \nis more likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  \nThis scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor \nline to the tank truck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture \narea is assumed at 0.5 square inches.  Because personnel are always \npresent at the facility during transfer, Battle Creek Co-op personnel \nwill respond within 10 minutes.
