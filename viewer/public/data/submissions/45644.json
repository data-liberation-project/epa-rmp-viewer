The facility is located on Highway 225 in Deer Park, Texas. Momentive sells resins & its precursors to other chemical companies that transform them into thousands of consumer products ranging from plastics to building materials. About 150 full-time employees work at the site.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nMomentive is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for our workers, the public, and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations.As part of this commitment, Momentive has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that provides the basis for managing risks at the site. The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1910.119. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Momentive Specialty Chemicals Deer Park Site. \n\nThe Risk Management Program at Momentive Deer Park Site consists of the following three elements:\n\n* A hazard assessment to (a) help the facility and community understand the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and to (b) provide information to the public regarding accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances)\n* A prevention program "

      "SummaryText": "to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes)\n* An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\n\n1. Momentive Specialty Chemicals strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility by implementing reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  Momentive also uses Corporate Engineering Guides and Standards (EGS) when designing new or modifying existing processes. Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.\n\nIn addition, the facility requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. The facility mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\n\nMomentive's goal is to minimize impacts from accidental release should they occur. In the event of an accidental release, plant operators and emergency responders work together closely to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the impact to the public and the environment. The facility maintains an active Emergency Response Team that is on call at all times to respond to accidental releases of any hazardous chemical handled at Momentive. The facility promotes the use of the CAER Phone Hotline number to inform citizens of any unusual plant event and will actively work with the Deer Park Citizen's Advisory Council. \n\nMomentive's Emergency "

This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency within the boundaries of the facility.  If the emergency extends beyond or could potentially extend beyond the plant boundaries, the Deer Park Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is notified and a statement of the type of emergency and any community protection factors are recommended.\n\nTo effectively implement these policies, Momentive has established a management system lead by the Site Manager with support from the Environmental & Health, Safety (EH&S) Department to oversee safety and environmental-related activities. \n\n2.

Momentive manufacturers and sells resins and it's precursors to other chemical companies that transform them into thousands of consumer products. \n\nThe following RMP listed toxic and flammable chemicals are handled at Momentive:\n\n    * Regulated Toxic Substances: Methyl Mercaptan, Epichlorohydrin.\n    * Regulated Flammable Substances: Pentane.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (68.155(c))\n\n\nThe facility performed off-site consequence analyses of accidental releases of regulated substances to estimate potential affects to the public or the environment. The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternate release scenario. Momentive does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur given the multiple levels of protection in "

This scenario assumes a maximum inventory of methyl mercaptan would be released and evaporates within a 10-minute period. Under the EPA defined worst weather conditions, the methyl mercaptan gas cloud could potentially travel 6.7 miles before the concentration diminished below the ERPG-2 concentration of 25ppm. No credit is taken for passive or active mitigation in the analysis. Potential public receptors include schools, residences, recreation areas, and industrial areas. Environmental receptors within this distance include a state park.\n\nAn \"alternate release scenario\" for methyl mercaptan involves a 1\" inch hole in the piping of the methyl mercaptan tank. It is estimated that a normal inventory of methyl mercaptan would be released over a 13-minute period. Active mitigation accounted for in the analysis includes operator intervention to shut-off the pump and isolate the leak. No credit is taken for passive mitigation. Und"

Potential public receptors include schools, residences, and industrial areas. There are no environmental receptors within this distance from the release point.\n\nEpichlorohydrin \nAlternate release scenario at tank D-340:\nAn \"alternate release scenario\" for epichlorohydrin (ECH) involves a failure of a 3-inch storage tank discharge line inside the tank dike.  This line failure results in an epichlorohydrin spill into the tank dike. Credit is taken for passive mitigation (e.g. the dike walls).  Under the EPA alternate release weather conditions, this release would travel 0.19 miles before the concentration diminished below the ERPG-2 concentration of 20ppm.
