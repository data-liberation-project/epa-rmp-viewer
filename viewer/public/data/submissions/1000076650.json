Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n     Policies\n\n\n\nThe ARKEMA COATING RESINS (ACR) Alsip Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Arkema Coating Resins Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe ARKEMA COATING RESINS (ACR) Alsip Plant is a manufacturing facility that produces synthetic latex polymer products, which are sold to customers that convert them into finished products such as latex paint, caulk and adhesives.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Alsip Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemicals.  The ACR Alsip Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substance at levels above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer (Acetic acid ethenyl ester)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alsip Plant does not utilize any chemicals on the RMP-regulated list of flammable substances.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nOur general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule and OSHA's PSM standard.  Key elements include:\n\n\n\nEquipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmen"

The PHA process incorporates Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) which uses semi-quantitative assessment techniques to ensure that controls used for prevention or mitigation of hazards provide adequate protection.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up-to-date.\n\n\n\nOperator Training/Certification Program:  The plant has training and testing program which provides operators with the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.\n\n\n\nTechnical Staff Training and Support:  Trained technical staff employees are available 24 hours a day to support operations.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Procedures:  The plant has specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Training:  The plant trains persons who perform routine or complex maintenance tasks on process equipment.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity Program:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are periodically tested and/or inspected to ensure safe operation of process equipment, following recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\n\n\n\nTask List is a database systems and SAP that generate reminders designed to ensure that process safety information is kept up-to-date.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:  The plant has a management system to ensure that modified facilities and processes will be safe to operate.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews:  Reviews are conducted just prior to startup to ensure that modified facilities and processes are safe for operation."

Our company and our employees are committed to the standards that these management systems set.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Arkema Coating Resins Alsip Plant that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe ARKEMA COATING RESINS (ACR) Alsip Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.

Drill schedule is established in the beginning of the year and communicated to shift team lead for guidance on scenarios. Site consider various factors while establishing drill schedule such as guidance from corporate guidelines, potential high risk process, past events or incidents etc. Each shift performs 4 drills annually, one drill per quarter. Site also work with Alsip Fire Department to schedule site wide annual drill, which may involve Haz mat team, Alsip police department. All all site employees, contractors working on the site participate in site wide drills. Depending on the drill-scenario and availability of other nearby township Fire departments also join the drill. Some of the drill scenarios site coordinated with fire department and Hazmat team are run-away reaction in the reactor-causing spill and injury, vapor cloud caused by inadvertent mixing of raw material in the monomer storage tank causing runaway reaction and rupture of the tank or rupture disk etc. \n\n\n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOn-going programs, such as Process Hazard Analysis evaluations, continually aim to improve process safety. This facility upgraded and installed new DCS (Distributed Control System) system to improve process performance in December 2019, which will also improve Process Safety and reliability."
