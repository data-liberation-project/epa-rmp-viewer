The plan provides for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe Clarence B. Walker Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine to treat both the raw water from Lake Allatoona and the finished water. The chlorination process includes gaseous chlorine, chlorination equipment and process safety equipment.\n\n For the chlorination process, accidental release modeling was done to determine potential consequences associated with accidental chlorine release. The first\"worst case scenario, defined by EPA, states that the qwner shall assume that the maximum quanity in the large vessel is released as a gas a 10 minute period. The \"alternative scenerio\" is definded as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario. An incident history review was performed for the Clarence B. Walker Water Treatment Plant to determine the most likely case scenario.\n\nThe Cartersville Water Department Risk Management Plan includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\n\n*Operator training\n*Preventive Maintenance Program\n*Process specific safety equipment\n*Safe and effective standards operating procedures, written with operator participation\n*Hazard review of equipment and procedures\n*Inspection Program\n\nFurther, The Cartersville Water Department has an active Safety Program with the following elements supporting the safe handling of chlorine:\n\n*Respiratory Protection (SCBA) Program\n*Chlorine detectors\n*Chemical Right to Know Program\n*Personel Protective "
