This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (Tessenderlo Kerley) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tessenderlo Kerley Facility is located in an industrial park in Eufaula, Alabama.  The Facility produces and/or distributes chemicals used in the agriculture and chemical market.  Production at the Facility consists of the manufacturing of ammonium thiosulfate (ATS) and Ammonium Bisulfite (ABS).  In addition, the Facility stores and/or distributes potassium thiosulfate (KTS), anhydrous ammonia, elemental sulfur and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN 32 %).\n\nATS Production\n\nThe production of ATS consists of three basic units: the sulfur incinerator/boiler, (ABS) absorber tower and the ATS reactor.  Molten sulfur is burned in the sulfur burner to form a sulfur dioxide gas stream, which is sent to the ABS tower.  The sulfur dioxide is then absorbed in an ammonium bisulfite/sulfite/sulfate and ammonia solution.  Ammonia, sulfur and the ABS solution are then routed to the ATS reactor to produce the ATS solution.\n\nAmmonia Unloading and Storage\n\t\nAmmonia is used as a raw material in the Facility.  It is brought to the Facility in railcars and stored in three tanks, which are filled to 85 % of their capacity.  The Facility utilizes a two-inch unloading hose at the railcar rack for the unloading of ammonia.  A one-inch vapor recovery hose is used to connect one-inch piping to t"

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nSeveral actions are to be incorporated during construction of new processes or equipment to ensure these are suitable for the process application.  Checks and inspections are to be performed to assure that installation is consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions suitable for the particular application.  The Facility has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include the following:\n\n1. control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel;\n2. a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;\n3. a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before process piping and equipment is opened;\n4. a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and,\n5. a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. \n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThere is a comprehensive system of written procedures to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, impact to safety and health and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Prior to changes being made, they are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing c"

Based on process knowledge, Tessenderlo Kerley identified one regulated substance kept on site above threshold quantities- anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe Eufaula facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Eufaula facility. The processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The facility is in the process of reviewing the accident prevention program and is in various stages of implementing changes to improve work place safety.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Eufaula facility actively seeks emp"

Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\n A variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nP"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and or other techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten procedures are to be maintained that address various modes of process operations, such as the following: \n\n1. initial startup;\n2. normal operations; \n3. temporary operations;  \n4. emergency shutdown;  \n5. emergency operations;  \n6. normal shutdown; \n7. startup following a turnaround; and \n8. start up after emergency shutdown.  \n\nThese procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  \n\nOperating procedures are to be periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review is to assure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in completing the stated procedures.

Plant personnel are to periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR should be conducted on any new facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and highly hazardous chemicals into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and are adequate.  Prior to startup, the facility determines that a PHA has been conducted, recommendations resolved, and training of employees involved in the process is verified as part of the PSSR.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWell established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment should be kept.  The basic aspects of this program are to include the following:\n\n1. training; \n2. developing written procedures; \n3. performing inspections and tests consistent with good engineering practices; \n4. correcting equipment deficiencies outside acceptable PSI limits; and,\n5. applying quality assurance measures.  \n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel are to receive training on the following:\n\n1. an overview of the process;\n2. safety and health hazards;\n3. applicable maintenance procedures;\n4. emergency response plans; and,\n5. applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe man"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition operating and maintenance personnel, including contractors employees, are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Facility promptly investigates (within 48 hours) all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The reports are maintained for five years.\n\nAn investigation team is established to investigate each process incident.  The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved; a contract employee (if the incident involved the work of a contractor); and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings in a report.  The report includes dates of the incident and investigation, description of incident, factors contributing to the incident, and develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Eufaula facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members with at least one person knowledgeable in the audit techniques.  The audit team develops fin"

Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked and documented until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The two most recent compliance audits reports are retained.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Eufaula facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following sections include descriptions of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Eufaula facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n Specialized Safety Features\n\nThe Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences (mitigate) of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Sensors with audible alarms are located to detect and warn of hydrogen sulfide leaks.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Pressure relief valves on applicable tanks.\n2. Key manual valves are chained and padlocked in their critical (open/closed) position.\n3. Excess flow check valves designed to plug the outlet if outflow reaches equivalent of flow due to pipe rupture.\n4. De-railer and chock blocks to prevent rail car movement.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Standard operating procedures that control, isolate, and terminate leaks.\n2. Personnel trained in emergency procedures.\n\nPersonal protective equipment (e.g., escape respirator, self-contained breathing apparatus, and supplied air breathing apparatus)."

      "SummaryText": "Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Eufaula facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  There has been no incident involving a regulated substance.\n\nEmergency Procedure Information\n\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures account for the possibility of a toxic substance being accidentally released, as well as for the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures. The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Facility.  \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Facility is coordinated with the Barbour County Emergency Management Agency (EMA).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic EMA meetings, the Facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the EMA and emergency response organizations, and the Facility provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant."
