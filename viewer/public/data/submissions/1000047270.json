Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Fresh Select has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Fresh Select, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Fresh Select has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name             Process Chemical        Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration    Anhydrous Ammonia       14,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. Organize"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n\n\nFresh Select facility is a commercial cold storage facility for deciduous tree fruit and citrus. The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to two storage rooms, one precooler, one loading dock, one glycol plate and frame heat exchanger, and a hydrocooler. A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \n\nThe refrigeration system utilizes both pumped overfeed and flooded refrigeration operation. The pumped overfeed portion of the system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to a liquid recirculator through a liquid feed solenoid valve and an expansion valve. From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils. Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils. Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through regulators or check valves and is returned to the liquid recirculator. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the liquid recirculator and the gas is returned to the main suction accumulator. From there the suction gas is piped to one reciprocating and two (2) screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure ammonia gas is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver. Some of the high pressure liquid from the receiver is injected into the oil cooler on the screw compressors. Excess liquid from the main suction accumulator d"

Operation of a float switch activate solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver. The system uses water to defrost the coils. \n\n\n\nThe flooded portion of the system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a liquid feed solenoid valve in the cold room where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator. Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils. Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator which separates any residual liquid from the gas. The remainder of the flooded portion of the system is described in the pumped overfeed system paragraph above.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system at Fresh Select contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected. \n\n  \n\nThe ammonia system at Fresh Select consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Fresh Select is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nFresh Select has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-"

The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Fresh Select facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nFresh Select has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nFresh Select's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nFresh Select has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

This has improved Fresh Select's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Fresh Select's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nFresh Select has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Fresh Select has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Fresh Select now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
