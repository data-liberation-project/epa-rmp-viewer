The facility went through a major expansion in 2005.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nThe Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nThe Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant is located in Iowa Falls, Hardin County, Iowa.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline) and is considered a flammable mixture.  The Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 5.6 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  The radius of impact for denaturant is about 0.6 miles.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 97,200 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.   The worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 340,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from entire denaturant tank.  The worst ca"

      "SummaryText": "se vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.6 miles from the center of the facility.  There is an estimated residential population of 22 people within the 0.6 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nSince the facility also qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was required.  The ARS is the release of 42,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.1 miles from the center of the facility.  There are no public receptors within the 0.1 mile radius.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nOn February 15, 2008, approximately 29,000 gallons of denatured ethanol (approximately 2.5% gasoline) was accidentally released while loading a railcar with ethanol for transport.  The release occurred because the hose used to fill the railcar was not properly attached, and the safety interlock which is to prevent loadout from starting if the loading spout is not secured, failed.\n\nThe plant timely notified DNR of the release, applied absorbent to the release, and the remediation contractor vacuumed up the product.  Most of the product was recovered and impacted soil was excavated and disposed of in a landfill approved by the DNR.  Hawkeye also constructed a product recovery trench and, as of this revision, continues to monitor and report the ethanol concentraton of the recovered water.\n\nSince the incident, full secondary containment has been installed at all railcar loading stations at the four Hawkeye plants.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate"
