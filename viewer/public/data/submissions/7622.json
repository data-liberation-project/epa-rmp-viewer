If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and/or other authorities, to migrate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\nFacility Information\n     Anhydrous Ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application. The maximun quantity stored would be 149,000 lbs in an 30,000 gallion tank.\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario and the Alternative release scenario\n     1. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 30,000 gallion tank released as a gas over 10 minuets. The maximun quantity released would be 149,000 lbs, whick represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capicity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion of 200 ppm) is 1.16 miles.\n     2. The alterative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion of 200 ppm) is .31 miles.\n\nSafety Requirements\n     The facility has implemented the provision of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Healty Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nThe Five Year Accident Histroy\n     There has been no accidential release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n     The facility as provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA TITLE III (EPCRA) and a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standards, 29 CFR 1910.120, including employee tr"
