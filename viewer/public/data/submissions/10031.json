If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Meade County Sheriff's Dept. and request them to respond.  We are an agricultural based business.  We sell Anhydrous Ammonia to farmers for fertilizer, for crops.  We also sell propane to area businesses, residences, and farmers.   We have two anhydrous tanks, 11,800-gallon, the other 26,000 gallon and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.  The propane tank is 11,800-gallons, and the associated piping, valves, etc.  The worst-case scenario for propane would be a failure of our 11,800-gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% @ 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles.  There are homes, major commercial, offices,  churches,  and an industrial area within dsitances to the endpoint, total population of approx. 800 people.  Worst case scenario for our Anhydrous ammonia would be failure of the 26,000-gallon tank, when filled to 85%, resulting in a gas release.  According to our guide, distance to endpoint is 1.02 miles.  Estimated population of approx 2000 people, a school, churches,residences, recreation areas, and major com-mercial, office, and industrial area.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes, are regulations.
