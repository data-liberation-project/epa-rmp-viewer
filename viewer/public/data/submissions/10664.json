Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to\nprevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\nHowever, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will\nrespond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES.\n\n   Seadrift Coke, L.P. is located on Texas Highway 185\nSouth, one (1) mile south of the intersection of Texas State\nHighway 185 and Highway 35, North Seadrift, Texas 77983.\nOur facility consists of one delayed coker and a rotary\nkiln. The primary product is calcined petroleum needle coke\nproduced from decant oil feedstock. Byproducts from the\ncoking process are gas oil, naphtha, light coker naphtha and\nfuel gas. Naphtha, light coker naphtha and fuel gas are\nregulated flammable substances. The other regulated\nsubstance is chlorine, which is used for water treatment.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS.\n\n   The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a toxic\nsubstance at our facility involves a catastrophic release of\nthe entire content of a full chlorine cylinder due to broken\nnipple or valve.  This scenario assumes release duration of\n10 minutes, a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and ambient\nair temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit. While the maximum\nquantity of chlorine stored per site is limited to 2000\npounds, which is less than the RMP threshold quantity for\nchlorine, we have developed numerous controls to prevent\nsuch releases and managed their consequence. No credit for\nadministrative controls was into account in evaluating this\nscenario. The maximum distance to the endpoint of 3ppm\n(0.0087 milligrams per liter) for the WCS is 3.0 miles.\n   The alternative release scenario (ARS) involves the\nfailure of a therm"

The\nmechanical integrity program involves personnel training,\ndeveloping written maintenance procedures, inspecting and\ntesting process equipment, and correcting identified\ndeficiencies.\n   Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) process\noverview, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable\nmaintenance procedures, (4) emergency response procedures,\nand (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they\nperform their job safely.\n   Inspections and tests are conducted at least as often as\nrecommended by the manufacturer or in accordance with good\nengineering practices. When possible, identified\ndeficiencies are corrected before placing equipment back in\nservice or an MOC team is assigned to review the use of the\nequipment and determine actions needed to ensure continued\nsafe operation of the equipment. The mechanical integrity\nprogram is evaluated periodically for compliance with\ncompany policy.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\n   It is the policy of Seadrift Coke, LP that all changes to\nequipment, materials, chemistry, operating parameters or\nother aspects of a covered process be subjected to a formal\nmanagement of change program. This requires that changes be\nthoroughly reviewed and documented, that all affected\npersonnel be informed, trained and certified if needed, and\nthat all plant drawings, operating procedures, emergency\nprocedures and records be updated and kept current.\n   A team of employees from maintenance, production, and\nLoss Control departments evaluates propose"

The\nteam determines the impact of planned changes on process\nhazard, material specification, safety, operating,\nmaintenance and emergency procedures, and required training\nfor affected employees.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n   Seadrift Coke, L.P. investigates all accidents,\nincidents, and near misses.  From these investigations\nremedial actions are developed.  The Loss Control Program\nSteering Committee reviews the remedial actions and the\napproved list of remedial actions is entered into the\nremedial action tracking system in the computer.  All\napproved remedial actions are followed up to completion,\nbefore the Accident/Incident Report is closed.   These\nincident reports are kept on file in the computer for at\nleast 5 years.  The reports are available to all employees\non the computer.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n   To ensure that accident prevention program continues to\nbe effective, a team of plant personnel conducts a quarterly\nevaluation on all Accident/Incident Reports entered during\nthe previous quarter.  These evaluation reports are sent to\nthe Loss Control Program Steering Committee for review and\ndiscussion.  The audit team's effectiveness and the entire\nAccident/Incident Reporting Program are audited at least\nannually to verify compliance with the established program.\nRemedial actions from this audit, approved by the Loss\nControl Program Steering Committee, are followed up to\ncompletion.\n\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n   The processes at Seadrift Coke, L.P. have hazards that\nmust be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The\naccident prevention program summarized above is applied to\nall RMP-covered processes. The prevention activities help\nprevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by\n(1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n   However, we have safety features on process units to help\n(1) contain/control a release, and (2) reduce the\nconsequence of (mitigate) a release. The following types of\nsafety features are used in various proce"
