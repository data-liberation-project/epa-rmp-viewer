      "SummaryText": "JASPER WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Jasper Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is the sole sewage treatment plant for the city of Jasper, Alabama and surrounding areas.  It treats approximately five million gallons of sewage per day.  The final treatment operation in the plant involves injection of chlorine into the treated wastewater to kill potentially harmful pathogens.  This is follow by injection of sulfur dioxide to destroy the residual chlorine in the plants final discharge.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only two regulated substances at the site.\n\nChlorine used for this disinfection is stored as a liquid under pressure in one-ton cylinders.  The cylinders are stored in a concrete cinder block and steel chemical feed building.  When connected to the process, chlorine is withdrawn from a cylinder using a slight vacuum and it is immediately dissolved into a small stream of the potable wastewater.  This chlorine water is then mixed with the entire plant wastewater flow in a contact tank where the chlorine reacts to kill pathogenic organisms such as e. coli.  The WWTP may have as many as six one-ton cylinders of chlorine on site at any one time.\n\nA chlorine residual in the water will remain after the disinfection reaction is complete.  This residual must be removed so the WWTP can meet its permitted chlorine discharge limits.  Sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the wastewater.  The procedure is much the same as for chlorine injection.  Sulfur dioxide is stored as a pressurized liquid in one-ton cylinders.  When connected to the process, sulfur dioxide is withdrawn from the cylinder with a slight vacuum and dissolved in potable.  This sulfur dioxide solution is then mixed with the entire plant flow and the sulfur dioxide reacts with residual chlorine to produce dissolved chloride salts.  The WWTP may have as many as five sulfur dioxide cylinders on site at any one time.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emer"

      "SummaryText": "gency Response Policies\n\nThe Jasper Waterworks and Sewer Board (JWWSB) is committed to absolutely preventing harmful releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  While there is no written policy to that effect, the actions of JWWSB management in providing regular training, and providing routine contracted maintenance of all elements of the gas systems proves that commitment.\n\nThe JWWSB is also committed to incorporating industry standard good practice into its emergency response practices for the WWTP.  To this end, the JWWSB is updating its emergency response program so that it will provide timely, coordinated response to any and all potentially harmful releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The model being used for the update is an industry standard prepared by the Chlorine Institute.  When fully implemented, the program will provide the best practical measures to protect the community from large-scale releases.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe first element of the accidental release program involves the design and construction of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  Chlorine Institute standards and good engineering practice were used in designing the chlorine system.  The sulfur dioxide system was designed and constructed following the recommendations in the Compressed Gas Association\u00bfs manual on Sulfur Dioxide.\n\nAnother important element of the plant\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is maintenance of gas systems.  Silver Sales, which is a regional supplier of operating and maintenance services for gas storage and injection equipment, currently provides twice-yearly review of the gas systems.  They test the critical components and maintain all the equipment in good working condition.  The plant, through Silver Sales, currently replaces all the gaseous tubing in the system twice per year and replaces the rigid gas piping once per year.  Silver Sales also keeps plant personnel updated on newer technologies and equipment being used for the type"

Dixie Crane inspects the hoists used to lift gas cylinders from the delivery truck and move them into storage positions in the chemical feed building.  This inspection is done yearly.  If any deficiencies or concerns are noted during the inspection, they are immediately addressed.\n\nTraining is the third major element in the plant\u00bfs release prevention program.  Only trained personnel are allowed to perform any activity related to use of chlorine or sulfur dioxide including unloading gas cylinders, connecting cylinders to the process, operating the gas injection processes, or disconnecting empty cylinders for the process.  Harcross Chemicals Incorporated, which is the WWTP\u00bfs supplier of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, provides this training every two to three years.  Training consists of eight hours of classroom lecture and hands-on demonstration.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe WWTP has experienced no harmful accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the five year prior to this update.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe WWTP emergency response plan follows the outline in Pamphlet 64 \u00bfEmergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities\u00bf published by the Chlorine Institute.  It contains guidance and methodology for planning for a release emergency.  This includes duties and responsibilities for plant personnel and for outside responders.  It contains instruction for internal and external communications.  It identifies emergency response equipment at the WWTP.  It gives clear instructions about evacuation procedures and post emergency restoration procedures.\n\nIn the event that outside response agencies are required, the emergency response plan identifies agencies whose assistance may be required and it gives instruction about coordinating response efforts with those agencies.  The plan instructs how to communicate with the media and the general public.  Finally, the response plan has detailed instructions about reporting incidents to req"

If subsequent deficiencies are identified, physical or procedural changes will be undertaken without delay."
