      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nDean Dairy Holdings, LLC processes fluid dairy products, ice cream and frozen desserts at Barber Court, Jefferson County, Birmingham, Alabama. The site is located on approximately 21 acres. The site consists of two separate manufacturing facilities which operate independent anhydrous ammonia systems. System #1 contains approximately 45,000 pounds of ammonia, System #2 contains approximately 23,000 pounds of ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of fluid dairy products, ice cream and frozen desserts within the facilities.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nDean Dairy Holding, LLC is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees, and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate actions to take in the event of a release.\r\n\r\nAs a part or its PSM Program, Dean Dairy Holdings has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  These programs include:\r\n1.\tProcess Safety Information\r\n2.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n3.\tOperating Procedures\r\n4.\tTraining\r\n5.\tMechanical Integrity\r\n6.\tM"
