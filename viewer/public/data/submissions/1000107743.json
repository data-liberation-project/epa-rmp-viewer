The\nobjective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to\nminimize the potential impact to employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. Management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nThis facility processes raw wheat to produce flour. The raw materials used in the processes are\nwheat and chlorine gas. Support operations include a chlorine system, a quality control laboratory, and administrative offices. One chemical is utilized at the facility, in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP. The chemical is chlorine and is used to bleach or age the flour.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios:\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario for the Martins Creek, PA location would be a damaged tank valve from the supplier. Each chlorine tank is independent of each other, therefore the loss of multiple tanks at the same time is not considered. This would result in the loss of 1 chlorine cylinder (liquified under pressure) contents of 2,000 pounds released over a duration of 10 minutes.  \n\nThe tanks are located inside a storage building designed for chlorine storage, which acts as a passive mitigation technique and limits the release rate to 110 lbs/min. Due to chlorine being a chemical of interest, normal operatin"

The identified environment receptor within the toxic endpoint is the Delaware River, Lower Mud Run Creek, and Martins Creek \n\nThe Alternative Scenario for the Martins Creek, PA location would be a leak from a 3/8-inch copper flex line that connects the chlorine cylinder to the manifold. This scenario is more plausible than the worst-case scenario based on Ardent Mills operational experience concerning chlorine application systems.  \n\nThis scenario encompasses a damaged pigtail with a 3/8-hole expelling chlorine gas at 33.3 lbs. per minute for a duration of 3 minutes.   \n\nThe release would be inside the concrete block storage room designed for chlorine storage, which acts as a passive mitigation technique and limits the release rate.
