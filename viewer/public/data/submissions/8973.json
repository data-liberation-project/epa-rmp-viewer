Failure analysis was not limited to mechanical issues, and included behavioral, administrative, and catastrophic events as part of each component evaluation.\nThe evaluation team consisted of the Facility Manager, a Lead Technician, at least one facility technician, and a corporate Solar Health and Safety member.  On a functional basis, this unified document allows for the rapid identification and evaluation of ammonia related issues, and identifies control technology and procedures to prevent or minimize a release.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis Emergency Action Plan was prepared in a joint effort between Solar Asset Management Services,\noperator of the facility and Berry Petroleum Company, owner of the facility.\n\nThe Berry Cogen-38 facility Emergency Action Program is established to implement a\nhealthy and safe environment in the workplace.  It should be used to ensure that all personnel\nhave proper training  and knowledge concerning the evacuation of the facility.\n\nPrinciple objectives of the program is to establish a plan for the rapid and orderly evacuation of all personnel in the event of an emergency.  The safety of all personnel at the site is of paramount importance.  This plan is\ndesigned to enhance the effectiveness of the coordination, communication and response to an emergency.\n\nThis program applies to all Solar Asset Management Services [SAMS] employees, contractors and visitors at the Berry Cogen-42 Facility located at 25121 North Sierra Hwy., Santa Clarita, CA 91321.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION:\n\nLOCATION AND SURROUNDING AREA:\n\nThe Berry Cogeneration-18 Facility is located in Kern County, California, approximately 3.2 miles southwest of the City of Taft and 3.2 mil"

The site is adjacent to the Berry Petroleum Company Production Facilities.  The area around the facility is basically uninhabited.\n\nCOGENERATION FACILITY:\n\nThe Berry Cogeneration-38 facility is owned by Berry Petroleum Company, Steam and electricity are produced, and electricity is sold to the local power utility company.  The facility consists of a single Frame -VI General Electric Gas Turbine (rated capacity 38 MW),  a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) including auxiliary duct burner  rated at 300,000 pounds per hour of steam, and associated auxiliary  and balance of plant systems.\nExhaust heat from the gas turbine is utilized in the heat recovery steam generation system..  All steam produced is delivered to the Berry Petroleum Company for injection into the oil formation for enhanced oil recovery.\nThe site is currently operated by Solar Asset Management Services and is manned 24 hours a day.  There are Five personnel ([1] Lead Technician-I, and [4] Technician-I personnel) assigned to the facility.\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA OPERATIONS:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in liquid form in a specifically design storage vessel.  Ammonia is stored at ambient temperature in the pressurized horizontal storage tank with typical quantities of 3000 to 9600 gallons.  When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a tank heater and vaporizing unit are utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor.  The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixing chamber where it is mixed with air.  The resulting vapor ammonia/air stream is then injected into the HRSG.  This, in conjunction with the catalyst within the HRSG, allow for the reduction of NOx and other unwanted materials being sent to the environment.  The exhaust gas, containing a lower concentration of NOx, is then sent f"

The largest quantity should be determined taking into account administrative controls such as procedures that could limit the quantity of a substance that can be stored in a vessel or pipeline at any time.  The worst-case release scenario is also defined by pessimistic meteorological conditions, including an atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour), and an ambient air temperature of 250C \n(770F).  Because Facility 38 is located in an area with few buildings nearby, open (rural) conditions were assumed to estimate the maximum impact.\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in liquid form in a 12,000-gallon tank.  Administrative controls limit the amount of ammonia in the tank to be 9,600 gallons.\n\nTo model the release, it was assumed that the entire contents of the ammonia tank were released over a ten-minute period from a one-inch diameter hole in the tank.  For the SLAB model, it was assumed that the release would consist of a mixture of 81 percent liquid and 19 percent vapor that would form an aerosol and behave initially as a dense gas.  The release was assumed to occur at ground level (0 meters height). The plume extends to 4.0 miles from the release point.  The actual direction of the plume would be dependent on \nthe wind direction at the time of release.  Previous evaluations f"

This scenario was identified during the process hazards analysis that was conducted for the facility and was based on the results of the analysis.\n\nThe scenario involves the release of ammonia from a 2-inch fill line at the tank.  The process conditions for the line include an operating temperature of 00F and a pressure of 114 pounds per square inch (psi).  It was assumed that the ammonia is released through a half-open fill line.  The release from the area was assumed to occur over a 5-minute period based on the hazard analysis.  The release height was assumed to be at ground surface.\nThe plume potentially extends to 0.6 miles from the release point.  Less than 50 people are estimated to live in the area potentially impacted by the alternative release scenario.  No sensitive receptors are known to be within this area.\n\nGENERAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe health and safety of all employees is the top priority.\nEnsure that all safety precautions are followed when performing startup, loading, and operations activities.\nAll affected employees are to be familiar with this program and follow its procedures.\nTraining of involved personnel on the program is required.\nEmployees will be given a initial orientation as to the purpose for this RMP manual.\nEmployees will be advised routinely as to the development stages of this RMP manual.\nEmployees will be advised of the developments concerning the hazard analysis discussions and\nfindings.\nEmployees will be given opportunities to discuss suggestions or concerns towards this manual.\nincluding the ongoing hazard analysis development.\n\nFIVE YEAR"
