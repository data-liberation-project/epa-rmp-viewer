(Myriant) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia (10,000 pounds) in their succinic acid bio-refinery processes.  Therefore, the facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.150.  The anhydrous ammonia system at the facility is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP Rule requires that covered facilities prepare an Executive Summary.  The following pages represent the Executive Summary, summarizing the items required as described in 40 CFR Part 68.155 (a) through (f).\r\n\r\n\u00a768.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nMyriant has documented emergency response procedures in place, as documented in the facility's Emergency Response Plan (HSE-08) and Emergency Action Plan (HSE-07).  This plan has been endorsed by Myriant staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facility. Myriant has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, which must be followed in the event of an anhydrous ammonia leak.  All personnel involved in handling anhydrous ammonia are trained with regard to ammonia safety and accident prevention.\r\n\r\n\u00a768.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Myriant Lake Providence, Inc. facility.  The regulated substance handled is anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n\u00a768.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nMyriant has a documented Prevention Program for the anhydrous ammonia process that documents release prevention measures.  These prevention measures include elements such as Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Wo"

As such, Myriant has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have resulted in on-site injuries or off-site injuries or other impacts.\r\n\r\n\u00a768.155(e) Emergency Response Program\r\nMyriant is a non-responding facility, as defined by USEPA (29 CFR Part 40 CFR Part 311).  Therefore, Myriant has developed an Emergency Response Plan (EHS-08) and Emergency Action Plan (EHS-07)to ensure employee safety instead of an Emergency Response Program, as allowed by 40 CFR Part 68.90(b). The Myriant Emergency Response Plan / Emergency Action Plan outlines actions required to respond to an anhydrous ammonia emergency and has coordinated this plan with East Carroll Parish LEPC and East Carroll Parish Fire Department. Fire Department personnel are the designated first responders in the event of an anhydrous ammonia emergency at the Myriant facility.  Myriant employees are not designated responders to an anhydrous ammonia release.  As specified in 40 CFR Part 68.90, Myriant's Emergency Response Plan / Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR Part 68.90(b) and therefore, the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR Part 68.95.\r\n\t\r\n\u00a768.155(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis which was conducted for the anhydrous ammonia process at the Myriant facility in September 2012.  Recommended improvements for the Myriant facility were identified in three main categories: Standard Operating Procedures, Engineering/Maintenance, and Administrative.  All safety improvements were made prior to startup and were investigated concerning their impacts o"
