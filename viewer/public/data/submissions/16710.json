Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Farmer's Cooperative Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment\n\n2. Facility Information: The facility is a country grain elevator which stores and blends fertilizers and sells propane on a retail basis. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. It is stored at the facility in one 18,000 gallon and 0ne 26,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity stored would be 187,000 pounds. Propane is stored at a separate site in one 18,000 gallon tank and is used for grain drying. The maximum quantity stored would be 56,600 pounds.\n\n3. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. Anhydrous ammonia: The maximum quantity released would be 110,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, ppm) is 2.2 miles. Propane: The maximum quantity released would be 56,600 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of 1.0 psi overpressure) is 0.3 miles or 1,580 feet.\n\n4. The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.
