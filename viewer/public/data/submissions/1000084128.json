Refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks placed away and protected form forklift and truck traffic). No releases or accidents, involving anhydrous ammonia, that are reportable in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP Rule), have occurred at this facility.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe low temperature recirculator contains the largest quanity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst-case basis. This vessel is typically maintained at approximately 30%, which is equivalent to approximately 6,781 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia. A WCS assumes that the tank's contents are released over a 10-minute period of 678 lbs. Per minute. EPA RMP Ammonia guidance Document Endpoint Tables predict, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmosphericstability Class F, the ammonia release may travel 1.5 miles from the point of release. It is estimated that approximately 2700 people may be affected in the surrounding community and highway.\n\n\n\nAlternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\nThe alternate case, more likely, release scenario was selected to involve a 3/4-inch relief valve lifting at 250 psig. Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 250 psi and 113 F) was estimately to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 0.75 inches) of approximately 92 lbs./min., determined from an ammonia gas release table. It is estimated that the release valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators on site, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 920 lbs. The EPA RMP Ammonia Guidance Document Endpoint Tables predicted with a wind speed of 6.7 mph and atmospheric stability Class D, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.2 miles. It is "

There is a major highway and a public rest stop, as well as adjacent business within the radius to the toxic end point.\n\n\n\nPlans have been implimented to improve the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at Southeast Frozen Foods by coordinating emergency response plan with the Calhoun County Office of Emergency Management. Annual operator refresher training, hazardous materials technician and incident commander training, and refrigeration process safety manangement program training is ongoing. Annual refrigeration process safety management program inspections are being conducted to improve the process.\n\n\n\nSoutheast Frozen Foods is committed to continous on-the-job training and through Refrigerating Engineers & Technicians Association (RETA)memberships/training and through outside contractor training.Southeast Frozen wants to partner up with local OSHA and EPA for continous guidance for better improvements. We have attended local DHEC training and national EPA/OSHA training."
