The maximum intended inventory of sulfur dioxide at the facility at anytime is 8,000 pounds (4 ton containers).\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant provides biological treatment for sanitary wastewater generated through out the Greenwood Metropolitan District service area.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process to destroy nuisance and pathogenic microorganisms present in the wastewater (i.e., chlorine use as a wastewater disinfectant is an industry standard).  The chlorination process includes chlorine container handling and storage facilities, chlorine feed system (piping, vacuum chlorinators, and injectors), and related safety equipment and instrumentation.  Sulfur dioxide is used in the wastewater treatment process to remove residual chlorine from the treated wastewater prior to discharge from the plant (i.e., sulfur dioxide use to dechlorinate treated wastewater is an industry standard).  The dechlorination process includes sulfur dioxide container handling and storage facilities, sulfur dioxide feed system (piping, vacuum sulfonators, and injectors), and related safety equipment and instrumentation.  The Greenwood Metropolitan District Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is manned 12-hours a day and access to the plant site is restricted to authorized personnel.  After hour notification of alarms is through SCADA dial out paging to an operator on call.\n\n3.  General accidental release program and the chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant complies with EPA's RMP rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and with all applicable state and local codes and regulations.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  Accidental release prevention is a function of the safety devices (technology) inherent in the facility design, safe material handling practices used (procedures), and commitment to training of plant employees (management practices).  All applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Prevention Program (40 CFR 68.65-87) are adhered to.  It is a goal of the Greenwood Metropolitan District Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant to ensure plant and community safety through an aggressive program of hazard analysis, preventive maintenance, equipment testing, standard operating procedures, and employee training.\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant emergency response policy involves the preparation of a emergency preparedness plan which is tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.   The emergency preparedness program includes procedures for notification of the Greenwood County HAZMAT Team (off-site mutual aid response), Greenwood County LEPC (community response plan), and SCDHEC (state response plan).  The Greenwood Metropolitan District Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant emergency preparedness program is based upon recommendations of the Water Environment Federation (WEF), Compressed Gas Association, and the Chlorine Institute and is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Emergency Response Program (40 CFR 68.90) requirements.\n\n2.

Five-year accident history:\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the past five years.  Due to the effectiveness of the  release prevention program, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide during the past five years.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has an emergency preparedness plan that is integrated with the LEPC plan.  The Greenwood Metropolitan District Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a mutual aid agreement with the Greenwood County HAZMAT Team to provide emergency response services in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  The plant emergency preparedness plan includes procedures for the notification of offsite mutual aid responders, LEPC, SCDHEC, and the public along with a discussion of actions to be taken in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.
