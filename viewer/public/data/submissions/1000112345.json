In the event of an emergency involving the New Haven Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the New Haven Fire Department and request their assistance. The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire response capability. The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the New Haven Fire Department and New Haven Office of Emergency Management. The New Haven Fire Department regularly participates in training and exercise sessions for this Facility.\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nShell is continually striving to make the New Haven Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for our employees, our neighbors and our community. In an effort to improve and promote system safety, Shell looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. The New Haven Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additionally, Shell works cooperatively with the surrounding community to address any concerns."

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release does occur, a Facility Response Plan (FRP) and Emergency Action Plan (EAP) are in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the New Haven Fire Department and New Haven Office of Emergency Management.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe New Haven Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. There have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials (Butane) covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nResponse actions are coordinated with the New Haven Fire Department. A Facility Response Plan (FRP) and Emergency Action Plan (EAP) are in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.

Shell and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, Shell also employs specific prevention measures that are incorporated into the process operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures include:\n\n-Process engineered and constructed (as a minimum) in accordance with recognized industry and company standards.\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety/relief valves).\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams.\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators along with third party 24/7 remote monitoring.\n-Computerized monitoring and control of process operation.\n-Redundant control systems.\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems.\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, and safety devices.\n-Limited facility access.\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs.\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits.\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators, and 24/7 remote"

Shell - New Haven Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors/visitors which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the New Haven Terminal.\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in three (3) storage vessels. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to an injection skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending/injection skid and auto analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees Fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail safe), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and HMI, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the New Haven Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB.
