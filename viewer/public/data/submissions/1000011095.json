      "SummaryText": "The Dos Rios Water Recycling Center (WRC) is one of several sites operated by the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) where liquefied gaseous chlorine is used for disenfection. The Dos Rios facility also utilizes liquefied gaseous sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the final effluent. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide is stored at the site in a quantity greater than the threshold for the Accidental Release Prevention Rules set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. SAWS has determined that the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and handling faciltiy on site is a Program 2 Process.  SAWS has upgraded its chemical storage area by enclosing it and has installed a dry scrubber system for containment and adsorption of process chemicals. The facility is not subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Plan rule and does not operate under one of the SIC codes listed in 40 CFR 68.10 (d) (1).\r\n\r\nThe goals of the SAWS Risk Management Program are to:\r\n\r\n* Protect public health and safety\r\n\r\n* Reduce the potential of an accidental release of chlorine\r\n\r\n* Minimize impacts should a release occur\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis has been performed for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide using EPA'S RMP*Comp calculations for offsite consequence analysis. Assuming a complete rupture of containers, off-site receptors would be impacted. Because all storage containers used by SAWS must conform to stringent Department of Transportation (DOT) construction standards the occurrence of a worst case release is not realistic. Information from the hazard analysis is used to improve emergency planning activities with the San Antonio Fire Department and the Bexar County LEPC. An analysis of a more likely alternative release (pipe leak) showed that Chlorine or Sulfur dioxide would not be expected to extend beyond property lines.\r\n\r\nThis plan contains a management program that details responsibility for implementing  and updating the RMP.  A hazard assessment was conducted to estimate potential environmental and public recep"

A Program 2 Prevention Program was prepared that documents a management program, safety information on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes, the results of the hazard review, written operating and maintenance procedures and descriptions of training, compliance audit and incident investigation procedures.\r\n\r\nSAWS has detemined that it will rely on local emergency response personnel to coordinate off-site activities in the event of a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. SAWS has an emergency response program to train employees to indentify the source of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak and to implement emergency notification procedures. SAWS provides annual in-house HazMat training for the emergency response employees.  SAWS works with the San Antonio Fire Department to ensure that proper emergency reponse procedures are in-place for responding to a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release. SAWS is an active member of the Bexar County Local Emergency Planning Committee and has participated in an LEPC video for informing residents about chlorine and other hazardous materials in their community."
