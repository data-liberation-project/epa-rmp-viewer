      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Public Service Company of Colorado (PSC) Fort St. Vrain Station.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are represented in the Emergency Planning and Response Sections of the Fort St. Vrain Station PSM/RMP manual for the chlorine system and the RMP manual for the ammonia system. PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nPSC management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP and RMP manuals.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nFort St. Vrain Station is a gas-fired electric generating station.  The PSM and RMP regulated substance currently handled at this facility is chlorine.  The chlorine is used for cooling and process water biocidal control and is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 6 containers (12,000 lbs.) on site.  In 2001, the facility is adding a new process using 29% ammonia solution, which is regulated under the RMP rule only, and qualifies for RMP Program 2 requirements.  The ammonia is used for flue gas treatment and will be stored in one 14,230 gallon storage tank with a possible maximum inventory of 107,609 pounds.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and"

      "SummaryText": " consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one-ton container of chlorine and/or 14,230 gallons of aqua ammonia) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  The RMP*Comp air dispersion model was used to determine distances to the toxic endpoints.  For chlorine, a distance of 3.0 miles to the toxic endpoint was calculated for a release of 2000 pounds in ten minutes.  For aqua ammonia, a distance of 2.7 miles to the toxic endpoint was determined for a release of 107,609 pounds in ten minutes.  Since the chlorine release produces the larger radius of influence, the results of the worst-case release scenario for chlorine are included in the RMP plan.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine consists of a release of 960 pounds of chlorine over a one-hour period due to a severed 5/16 inch pigtail on the one-ton container.  No active mitigation devices were considered to influence the release scenario.  A distance of 0.7 miles to the toxic endpoint was determined.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for aqua ammonia consists of a release of 1000 gallons (7562 pounds) of ammonia over a one-hour period due to a hose failure at product delivery.  Release into the diked area was considered to influence the release scenario.  A distance of 0.2 miles to the toxic endpoint was determined.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine and Aqua Ammonia\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Fort St. Vrain Station Chlorine System PSM/RMP manual and the Ammonia System RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n? Employee participation, which includes provisions for active participation by plant employees in the development and implementation of the plan"

The program is described in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP and RMP compliance manuals and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Fort St. Vrain Station PSM/RMP and RMP programs, process hazard analyses and hazard reviews were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations were implemented, all were considered.  The exercise provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes.\n\nAdditionally, though the ammonia process is regulated by RMP Program 2 requirements, PSCo has determined to voluntarily comply with RMP Program 3 requirements to provide a higher level of safety and environmental protection."
