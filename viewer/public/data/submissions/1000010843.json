      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Program (RMP) was prepared for Waste Management LNG,Inc.'s (WM) newly constructed Altamont Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) facility located in Alameda County, California. This RMP addresses United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP requirements and the USEPA RMP computer program, RMP*COMP, was used to evaluate the worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios. Finally, because this facility is subject to the Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards, this RMP is designed to meet the specific requirements of those standards as well.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is WMA?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. WM is committed to protect the health and safety of its employees and the public. In order to achieve this objective, WM has allocated and invested considerable resources in implementing reasonable controls to prevent predictable releases of LNG by training its employees, by the safe design, installation, maintenance and operation of this facility, and by installing fire and leak detection and mitigation systems. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Chemicals Handled\n\nThe Altamont LNG facility is owned and operated by WM. The primary purpose of this facility is to convert landfill gas to LNG. The LNG will be dispensed at the facility into trucks for transport to an off-site facility where it will be use for fueling vehicles. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is LNG. Methane, which is the major component of LNG, is considered hazardous by the USEPA. LNG is a flammable liquefied gas. It is stored at -258.7 A?C. It is a clean burning fuel. The maximum intended inventory of LNG at this site is 180,000 lbs.  \nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nPer changes to federal RMP reporting requirements ma"

      "SummaryText": "de in the interest of national security, information regarding the accidental release scenarios has been omitted from this Executive Summary. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo ensure worker and community safety, the Altamont LNG facility includes numerous mechanisms for preventing accidents. These include designing the facility to meet all current design standards (including National Fire Protection Association [NFPA]-59A [Standard for the Production, Storage, and Handling of Liquefied Natural Gas] and those applicable to earthquake safety); regular facility maintenance; worker training regarding facility operation, safe LNG handling procedures, and response to accidents; leak and fire detection systems; emergency shutdown procedures; and compliance audits. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nBecause this is a new facility, a five-year accident history is not applicable. \n\nEmergency Response \n\nEmergency response at this facility will be handled by the local Fire Department (Alameda County Fire Department).  Facility personnel will not be expected to perform emergency response activities apart from: 1) reporting an incident (LNG leak or fire) when it occurs, 2) activating any facility-wide notification system, and 3) evacuating the facility to a safe location. Note that the facility is designed to be in compliance NFPA-59A. \n\n \nPlanned Changes\n\nNo changes to improve safety are planned at this time as the facility is not yet operational. Additional changes to improve safety will be determined based on experience with the operating facility. \n \n"
