Based on the Risk Management Program, Program Level applicability provisions, the covered process at the Philip J. Holton Purification Plant meets the criteria of a Program Level 2 process.\r\n\r\nThe Philip J. Holton Purification Plant has developed an accidental release prevention program and implemented chemical-specific prevention steps to manage the covered process.  The program includes both a documented compliance manual and administrative procedures to manage the program.  Specific elements of the program include, but are not limited to:\r\n\u00bf A documented management system\r\n\u00bf Completion of routine hazard assessments, including an offsite consequence analysis\r\n\u00bf Assembly and retention of chlorine safety information and other process safety information\r\n\u00bf A hazard review process to evaluate the controls and safeguards of the process\r\n\u00bf Written standard operating procedures for chlorine management and operations\r\n\u00bf A written training program for the risk management program, inclusive of applicable operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures\r\n\u00bf A chlorine system, preventive maintenance program\r\n\u00bf A system for routine compliance audits, inclusive of third-party audits, as applicable\r\n\u00bf A written incident investigation program\r\n\u00bf A written emergency response program\r\n\u00bf A documented Risk Management Plan\r\n\r\nIn addition to the covered process, accidental release prevention program, the facility has an active safety program, involving all site personnel.  All employees have the authority to stop work if deemed unsafe and report the unsafe condition through a formal process. There is an active Safety Committee, which meets monthly.\r\n\r\nAll new employees receive facility-specific safety training.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary: \r\n(a) The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy: It is the policy of Providence Water to operate the Philip J. Holton Purification Plant safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the chlorine system and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment. \r\n\r\nSafe operation depends on proper storage of chlorine, proper handling of the chlorination system, and inherent safety features in the design and operations of the chlorination system. \r\n\r\nSafety in storage and handling is achieved through the use of safe handling procedures and training of personnel.   The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the facility. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the Hope Jackson Fire Department.\r\n\r\n(b) The Stationary Source and Substance Handled: The Philip J. Holton Purification Plant is a stationary source operating for the purpose of treating surface water for use in households, businesses, and industries within the Providence and surrounding member communities.  Chlorine, which is a regulated, toxic substance, is used as part of the treatment process. \r\n\r\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  Providence Water has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine at the Philip J. Holton Purification Plant located in Hope, RI.  \r\n\r\nProvidence Water is a public utility, which is not subject to federal OSHA requirements.  There have been no accidents occurring within the last five years at the facility and a worst-case release has the potential to affect an off-site public receptor.

Holton Purification Plant has developed a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan. The plan addresses fires, explosions, spills or releases of hazardous chemicals (including chlorine), severe weather, and other potential emergency conditions. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of local, state, and federal agencies. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes emergency response to chlorine releases. Should an emergency release of chlorine occur at the facility, the facility will be evacuated, the Hope Jackson Fire Department will be notified, and the Fire Department will assume Incident Command. \r\n\r\n(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety: The Philip J. Holton Purification Plant completed its most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in the first quarter of 2019. As a result of the PHA review, a number of improvements to the risk management program have either been completed or are planned.  The improvements are intended to improve the safety of the process and minimize the potential for a release.  Changes primarily include program changes (improved documentation), operating procedure or checklist updates, and employee training.\r\n\r\nRegistration:\r\nThis Risk Management Plan includes the required registration information referenced in 40 CFR \u00a768.160(b)(1) through (22) to be reported for a Program 2 process.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\r\nAs a Program 2 covered process with a regulated toxic substance, an offsite consequence analysis has been performed for one worst-case release scenario and o"
