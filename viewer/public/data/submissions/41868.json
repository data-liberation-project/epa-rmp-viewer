The Facility?s mission is to protect public health by treating and disposing of residential and commercial wastewater. \n\nChlorine is used for disinfection and a maximum of 10,000 pounds is stored on-site. Sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate wastewater effluent prior to disposal. A maximum of 6,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide is stored on-site. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored as a gas that is liquefied under pressure in containers (1 ton cylinders) that contain 2,000 pounds each\n\nChlorine and Process Safety Equipment\n\nThe following paragraph provides a brief narrative of the LSRWWTP?s chlorine system. The LSRWWTP has one chlorine system that serves as the disinfection system which provides a chlorine solution to application points within the treatment process. Although the disinfection system is equipped with evaporators, they are not currently used. Only gas chlorine is utilized for disinfection which employs Vacuum Regulator ? Check Units (VRCU). The VRCUs are used to reduce the pressure of the chlorine to a slight vacuum. A vacuum created as water flows through ejectors pulls the chlorine gas from the VRCUs through the chlorinators and into the ejector assemblies. At the ejectors, chlorine gas is mixed with water to form a dilute chlorine solution. The chlorine solution is then distributed to the various application points. The flow rate of chlorine gas is controlled for each application point by adjustment of the respective chlorinator located just upstream of each ejector assembly. \n\nSulfur Dioxide Process and Safety Equipment\n\nThe following paragraph provides a brief narrative summary of the LSRWWTP?s  sulfur dioxide system. The LSRWWTP has a complete vacuum system that feeds sulfur dioxide gas through"

      "SummaryText": " vacuum regulator-check units (VRCUs) mounted on ton containers. The vacuum gas system utilizes pressurized sulfur dioxide gas (approximately 130 psig) from the container passing through the VRCU where it is reduced to a slight vacuum. A vacuum, created as water flows into the ejectors, pulls the sulfur dioxide gas from the VRCUs, through the sulfonators and into the ejector assemblies. At the ejectors, sulfur dioxide gas is mixed with water to form a dilute sulfur dioxide solution. The solution is then distributed to various application points. \n\nThe complete vacuum system is inherently safe by design since most of the system components are under vacuum. Any break or damage to a vacuum component will allow air into the system but will not cause a chemical leak. The ton containers, which are under positive pressure, are the only system component where a leak could occur. In the unlikely event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak, a leak detector located in the chemical container storage area will activate alarm horns throughout the facility. If the leak detector is activated, LSRWWTP staff will implement the facility?s emergency response system. \n\nRisk Management  and Process Safety Management Program Overview\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation which can be found in 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) regulation which can be found in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe primary components of the RMP are as follows:\n\n? A five-year accident history\n? An off-site consequence analysis for a worst-case and alternative case scenario\n? A comprehensive prevention program to minimize risks (i.e. minimize the potential for a release)\n? An emergency response program to ensure that an accidental release is handled appropriately\n? An overall management program to supervise the implementation of the RMP\n\nThe following sec"

Since the largest container stored at the facility holds 2,000 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, the worst case scenario for each chemical is a release of the entire 2,000 pounds over 10 minutes. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release is a ?more likely? incident than the worst-case. The RMP regulation allows the owner to define the alternative release scenario based on historical experience or operations staff knowledge of their system. The alternative release scenario for the facility was to assume that the vacuum regulator mounted on the chemical container gas valve failed.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThere are always inherent risks associated with the handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. These risks include the potential inhalation of either chemical if it is accidentally released. The prevention program is a key component to reducing the risk associated with a potential chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas release. Key elements of the prevention program include:\n\n?
