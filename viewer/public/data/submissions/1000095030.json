The plant was evacuated, and fire department was called to extinguish the fire. The explosion caused offsite environmental damage in the form of a grass fire. No deaths or injuries resulted from the accident.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSummit Midstream has established and coordinated emergency response action plans with the Pawnee Fire Protection District.  The emergency response plan also includes procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies, if a release occurs.  The specific details of the action plans are documented in the PSM/RMP program manual.  \n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety shall be actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues shall be held regularly at the plant. Employees will be encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted with key employees to meet the PSM requirements. During these sessions, recommendations are made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases. Each recommendation is considered for implementation. Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process."

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. \n \nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency in a timely manner to assure safe operation. \n \nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Summit Midstream incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n \nManagement of Change\n \nSummit Midstream has developed a system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Company has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Additionally, gas plant personnel will periodically evaluate the performance of contract employers in complying with plant safety policies and procedures.\n \nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n \nSummit Midstream conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides a final check to ensure (1) that all construction and equipment satisfies design specifications and (2) that all safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place.

These procedures shall be annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures will be kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n \nThe operating procedures are used to communicate safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) pipe break procedures for hazard mitigation before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n \nTraining\n \nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Summit Midstream has developed a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

Within the PHA, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Company primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The HAZOP methodology utilizes a systematic nodal approach to assess potential process deviations and associated risks.\n \nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when it believes such measures are necessary. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking is measured against the Summit Midstream risk matrix to ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate attention. \n \nOperating Procedures\n \nSummit Midstream maintains written procedures that address various modes of process"
