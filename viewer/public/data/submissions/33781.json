The Plant is a 70-megawatt, gas-fired cogeneration facility, located at Dow\u00bfs Pittsburg, California, chemical facility.  The Plant\u00bfs covered process is the ammonia storage system that provides an ammonia source for the Selective Catalytic Reduction system used to control air emissions.  The covered process includes one 15,000-gallon tank storing a maximum of 12,975 gallons (66,000 pounds), as limited by administrative system controls.  The Plant is regulated under the federal Accidental Release Prevention Program due to on-site anhydrous ammonia storage in excess of the 10,000-pound federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) applicability threshold in a process and under the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program due to on-site anhydrous ammonia storage in excess of the 500-pound California RMP applicability threshold.\n \nChemical Safety Overview:  The Plant is dedicated to protecting employees, the community, and the environment from chemical incidents through safe operation of the facility.  As part of its obligation to protect the integrity of human, environmental, physical, and financial resources, and to conserve and efficiently utilize those resources, Calpine will:\n\n1.Fully comply with laws regulating Environmental Protection and Employee Health and Safety;\n\n2.Furnish workplaces free of recognized hazards likely to cause injury to employees, the public, or the environment;\n\n3.Train employees in safe and environmentally conscious practices and require compliance with environmental, health, and safety (EHS) regulations, policies, and procedures; and\n\n4.Provide professional staff to maintain and support EHS programs.\n\nCalpine Corporation and the Calpine Pittsburg Plant are committed to conducting safe and environmentally sound operations.  This commitment is documented in the corporate policy and in the EHS program that is available to al"

This program consists of a series of policies, procedures, and manuals for the equipment and chemicals on site and includes a Process Safety Management (PSM) program, a Release Contingency Plan, an RMP, guidelines for use of personal protective equipment, and training requirements and documentation.  The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the Plant\u00bfs RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes, and standards (US EPA 40 CFR 68 and California\u00bfs Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5).  \n\nFive-year Accident History:  The Plant has had no RMP-reportable accidents/releases of ammonia within the five years preceding this RMP submittal.\n\nPrevention Program:  The Plant has implemented a Program 3 level Prevention Program, as required by the RMP rules.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of accidental anhydrous ammonia releases from the Plant and include such measures as process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incidenet investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractors.  The Plant prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  Overall safety at the Calpine Pittsburg Plant is governed not only by the ability to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Calpine has developed an Anhydrous Ammonia Spill/Release Contingency Plan to minimize the effects of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia on employees, the public, and the environment.  Leak determination is generally perfor"

      "SummaryText": "med by Calpine personnel.  Outside agencies (e.g., the fire department) will respond and provide a primary response role.  Because Calpine is located within the Dow Chemical facility, an arrangement is in place so that Dow Chemical Emergency Responders will intially respond and provide an additional back-up role after arrival of the fire department.  The Plant falls under the Contra Costa County Hazardous Materials Area Plan.  If an incident occurs and emergency response is required, the Plant calls 911 to notify the local dispatch center who may activate the community warning systems (CWS) if deemed necessary.  The dispatch center then notifies the CCCHSD hazardous materials (HAZMAT) response.  Employees are trained on the Contigency Plan procedure when initially hired, when the procedures are revised, and when employees\u00bf responsibilities are changed, and they receive annual refresher training on the emergency response program.\n\nSafety Management and Changes:  Calpine Pittsburg Plant management developed a formal management system to plan, organize, implement, and control the RMP elements of the anhydrous ammonia system.  To ensure efficient and effective management of Plant operations, management has developed the PSM program and RMP.  These programs provide a systematic and integrated approach to evaluating, implementing, and continuously improving PSM/RMP activities.  To ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain and improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance, and investigations will be conducted as required by the RMP.  Updates to the RMP will be completed as necessary in response to these activities.\n\nSummary:  As documented in this submittal, the RMP for the facility has been completed in accordance with all 40 CFR 68 and CalARP requirements and the facility has certified RMP compliance."
