      "SummaryText": "The City of Newport Beach California owns and operates the Big Canyon Reservoir water facility located at 3300 Pacific View Drive, Corona Del Mar, CA. The primary purpose of the reservoir is to store and supply the residents of Newport Beach with potable water. The facility uses chlorine for disinfection and maintaining the water quality. The facility houses 10 one ton containers of chlorine. 4 one ton containers are in service while 6 remain in storage.\n\nBecause of the chlorine on site, the City is required to comply with an EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) as well as OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP). \n\nIn August 2003, the City contracted BLACK & VEETCH to administer and complete a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the Big Canyon Reservoir facility. The PHA identified the hazards of the process, previous incidents or near misses, safeguards, facility siting, human factors, and used a risk ranking matrix to identify the severity of each scenario. The PHA team which composed of operators, managers, and staff, ran \u00bfwhat if\u00bf scenarios to identify all possible risks. Recommendations were added to each scenario as needed. The PHA included up to date process flow diagrams as well as drawings.\n\nThe City of Newport Beach has formalized its prevention response by updating the training practices, equipment maintenance, operations procedures, employee feedback forms, employee participation plan, emergency response plan, employee safety programs, and contractor programs.\n\nThe Big Canyon Reservoir Emergency Response Plan was updated. The plan addresses a combined response from City staff as well as outside agencies to respond to a chlorine leak. The plan includes operator instructions on how to respond if a leak should occur. \n\nBLACK & VEETCH completed an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) for the Big Canyon Reservoir process system. The OCA includes a worse case release scenario, alternative release scenario,"

Regular meetings are held to discuss any recommendations for improvement. \n\nThe City of Newport Beach has owed and operated the facility for 45 years. In 45 years, not one accident has resulted from a chlorine leak that has injured the public or its employees. In September, 2003 the City of Newport Beach will be removing all chlorine ton containers from the facility and converting the system to Sodium Hypochlorite."
