The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 112,156 pounds stored in two bulk storage vessels (12,000 gallons each).  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered by truck and distributed into smaller tanks for use as a fertilizer.\n\nWorst-Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe scenarios were conducted using the RMP*Comp program as provided by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario involved a catastrophic release of the total contents of a 12,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage vessel at the facility.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14 milligrams per liter (mg/L) was 2.8 miles.  The alternative release scenario involved a release from a transfer hose failure.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14 mg/L was 0.1mile.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Ivan Dayhoff Elevator, Inc., facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and applicable state and local codes and regulations.
