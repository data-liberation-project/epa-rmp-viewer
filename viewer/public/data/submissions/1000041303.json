This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators as electronic files on computers located in the control rooms and in hard copy for all emergency procedures.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process or working within a RMP-covered process.  New employees receive 40 hours of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) basic training.  Personnel in refinery operations receive an additional six weeks of job-specific training.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-related duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Before operating in a process operators must be certified by demonstrating adequate skill and knowledge in that specific process.  All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted routinely with the maximum time frame to be at least every three years.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and is considered adequate for the complexity of the processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The PHAs are facilitated by someone with experience with the selected method.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed and resolved by local management.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal sh"

The Refinery uses PICS (Pacific Industrial Contractor Screening), a third party consulting company who evaluates and monitors contractor qualifications and safety records.  Contractors are to be approved by PICS before they enter the Refinery.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance through job site audits and PICS reports to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  The information and data from the audits is communicated to contractors to facilitate continuous improvement.  The Eagles (behavioral based safety program) also conduct observations of contractors. \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Kenai refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the Kenai refinery.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Refinery has safety features on many units to help contain and control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\u00bf\tPortable hydrocarbon detectors;\r\n\u00bf\tHeat, smoke, and flame detectors;\r\n\u00bf\tGas and toxic detectors for control rooms and the laboratory; and \r\n\u00bf\tH2S detectors for the sulfur unit and the API area.\r\n\r\nRelease Containment"

      "SummaryText": "TESORO ALASKA COMPANY KENAI REFINERY\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nRMP Correction - March 2017\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Tesoro Alaska Company (Tesoro) Kenai Refinery (Refinery) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Kenai Refinery, located in Nikiski, Alaska, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and gasoline) from crude oil.  The refinery uses or produces several regulated flammables, such as pentane, propane and butane.  Tesoro calculated the quantity of RMP regulated substances using detailed engineering calculations.\r\n\r\nThe 2017 update includes the new Flare Gas Recovery unit within the existing Amine unit.  The reportable quantity of RMP regulated flammable material increased from 58,000 lbs to 83,000 lbs.  No changes to existing release scenarios were required by this change.  \r\n\r\nThe 2014 recertification included the addition of the Mega Splitter, part of the Crude Unit, which increased the reportable quantity of RMP regulated flammable material from 989,687 lbs to 1,000,000 lbs in the Crude unit.\r\n\r\nTesoro calculated the mass of RMP regulated flammable materials in each tank using detailed engineering calculations.   Per 68.115(b)(2) tanks that contain less than 1% by weight of a regulated substance in a mixture, the mixture is not included in the total quantity calculations for comparison against the threshold quantity.  In addition, tanks whose c"

The RMP regulation also includes exemptions for gasoline and Naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures [68.115(b)(2)(i) and 68.115(b)(2)(ii)].  In the previous submittal tanks that qualify for these exemptions were included in the total quantity reported.  As a result the total quantity for the Tank Farm decreased from 163,203,168 lbs in the 2011 submittal to 4,000,000 in the 2014 submittal.  However, the tanks meeting the above exemptions are included in the RMP because they are interconnected with the covered process(es).\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative scenario (ARS) for the Kenai Refinery were reviewed to ensure all modeling inputs, including process volumes and composition, are still valid. The OCA has not changed since the 2011 submissions, with the exception of population estimates within the radius of impacts (ROI) of the WCS and ARS made during the 2014 recertification.  Tesoro evaluated the populations within the ROIs using MARPLOT, an EPA tool that utilizes 2010 census data. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAt Tesoro we are proud of our safety performance.  The Kenai Refinery (Refinery) has had an excellent record of accident prevention since the start of our operation in 1969.  In fact, we have never experienced an incident that impacted people or property outside of the Refinery since 1969.  One reason for our success at preventing accidents is that we investigate even minor incidents promptly and thoroughly to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  Thus, we can eliminate many problems before they become accidents.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Kenai Refinery.  This program includes the required elements of our Process S"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating parameters), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to:\r\n(1)\tEnsure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards;\r\n(2)\tVerify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change;\r\n(3)\tAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes; and\r\n(4)\tOperating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\nThe Refinery conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  PSSR is integrated into the Management of Change (MOC) program and is required for every MOC.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention progr"

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably had the potential to have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release, that could have caused major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of safety management and accident prevention.
