Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention\nprograms including:\n\n     Process safety information\n     Process hazard analysis\n     Operating procedures\n     Training\n     Mechanical integrity\n     Management of change\n     Pre-startup review\n     Compliance audits\n     Incident investigation\n     Employee participation\n     Hot work permit\n     Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific\nprevention steps:\n\n     Safety relief valve protects storage tank from over pressure\n\n     No pumps are used in SO2 service\n\n     Process hazard analysis completed every 5 years\n\n     Operational reviews completed for all process changes\n\n     Annual review of operating procedures\n\n     Hazard communications training provided for all personnel - operational and maintenance\n\n     Periodic testing and inspection of equipment and piping\n\n     Facility emergency action program in place\n\n     Formal investigations conducted for all significant releases\n\n     Formal facility audits \n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental\nchemical releases.  NCSD and our employees are committed to the standard that these\nmanagement systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and\ncontrols to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNCSD keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our sites.  The\nfollowing is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under\nEPA's RMP rule (releases that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site,\nor known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelterin"
