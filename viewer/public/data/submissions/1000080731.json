The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of the facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has coordinated with the local fire department and emergency planning committee so they can plan for a response to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \r\n\r\n3.  Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios:  The worst case and alternate case release scenarios are not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\r\n\r\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:   The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Equipment and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the state Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2014 (previously ANSI K61.1) and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n5.  The Five Year Accident History:  There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that has resulted in any onsite deaths, injuries or property damage or to the best of our knowledge any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n6.  The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and"
