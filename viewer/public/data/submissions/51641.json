      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and staff of the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant are committed to operating the Plant with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment. To ensure the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment, the Plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68. The policies and procedures integrated under the Plant?s management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia. \n\nDescription of Processes, and Regulated Substances Handled at the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant \n\nThe Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant produces fluid milk and ice cream products. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant. Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: Liquid storage; Expansion; Evaporation; Compression; and Condensation. \n\nMechanical refrigeration is a physical process, rather than a chemical process: the ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the refrigeration cycle. Heat is removed from the product being refrigerated or frozen as ammonia changes phase from liquid to vapor. By reliquefying the ammonia vapor, the ammonia can be used continuously in the refrigeration cycle. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant which is subject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard). Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system. \n\nAt ambient temperature and pressure, ammonia is a colorless gas with a characteristic, irritating odor. \nAmmonia is highly soluble in water. Ammonia is the"

Anhydrous ammonia is handled both as a pressurized liquid \nat ambient temperature and as a refrigerated liquid at or below ambient pressure within the Bellevue Milk and \nIce Cream Plant refrigeration system. \n\nThe toxic endpoint to which the consequences of ammonia releases must be analyzed is 0.14 mg/L. This is approximately equal to 200 ppmv, which corresponds to the American Industrial Hygiene Association?s Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2) for ammonia. ERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe Plant?s accidental release prevention program consists of the following elements: Process Safety \nInformation; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety \nReview; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; Compliance \nAudits; and Employee Participation. The purpose and scope of each element is briefly described below. \n\nProcess Safety Information - The purpose of compiling the required Process Safety Information is to enable Plant personnel who work with the ammonia refrigeration system to identify and understand the hazards posed by ammonia refrigeration. The Plant?s Process Safety Information procedure addresses: Information requirements pertaining to the hazards of ammonia; Information requirements pertaining to the technology of the process; Information requirements pertaining to the equipment in the process; and Process Safety Information accessibility requirements. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The purpose of the Plant?s PHA procedure is to describe the method for "
