ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston is committed to providing its employees and the surrounding community with a safe and healthy environment.  The Risk Management Program is an integral part of our strong commitment to sustainable development, which means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  Sustainable Development requires reductions in the generation of wastes and pollutants, protection of clean air and clean water, sustainable protection of the land, and the wise use of energy.  It requires employee commitment, strategic thinking, innovation, the involvement of our suppliers, new technology, and enhanced production processes.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Boardman-West, Oregon processing plant produces various potato products such as french fries and formed potato products.  The plant site consists of a main processing plant, primary water treatment facility, and refrigerated cold storage.  Activities are conducted at this site during all months of the year.\r\n\r\nPotato processing includes several activities and processing steps.  The plant purchases the majority of its potatoes from local growers.  Since potatoes have a single growing season, they must be held under controlled storage conditions.  Prior to processing, the potatoes are separated by  and processing specifications.  The inspected, washed, peeled, and trimmed potatoes are cut, blanched and fried.  The final products are frozen, packaged, and prepared for shipping.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nConAgra Foods Lamb Weston's accident prevention/loss control systems and policies involve a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and best-management practices.

Process safety information is a collection of data that allows us to identify and understand the hazards posed by our inventory.  Representatives from our skilled work force and ConAgra Foods Lamb-Weston management, who understood the process being analyzed including the engineering behind the covered process, conducted the process hazard analysis.  This analysis identifies potential process failures that could result in an uncontrolled release of ammonia.   \r\n\r\nIn order to safely manage changes that need to be made to the processes containing ammonia, a system of checks and balances has been established.  This system will evaluate safety prior to the work being done, and provide a solid review of the system to assure that once started, it will run as designed.  Standard operating procedures are in place for each operating phase and are readily accessible to those workers who operate or maintain the process.  In addition, a policy and procedure are used to assure that proper safety precautions are taken for all personnel performing Hot Work.  The integrity of the refrigeration system equipment is maintained according to recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices and according to a well-documented preventive maintenance program.\r\n\r\nAn"

The facility also has a training program for all employees and contractors regarding the hazards of the chemical and safe work practices to be used.  Part of this training includes monthly safety meetings as well as drills on spill/release response and plant evacuation.  \r\n\r\nAny incidents related to the ammonia refrigeration systems are promptly investigated even though the rule only requires investigation of those incidents, which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release.  All incidents are analyzed, resolved, and findings shared with affected employees.  In order to assure compliance with all elements of the prevention program, an audit is conducted every three years including a report of the findings and documentation of any deficiencies corrected.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston Boardman West facility released approximately 275 pounds of ammonia on May 16, 2012 when a weld on a freeze tunnel coil cracked and leaked.  The release resulted in 88 employees being relocated from the area and 11 employees being sent to a medical facility for evaluation and released.  No other incidents from covered processes in the last five years have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe Boardman-West, Oregon plant has an emergency action plan which has been coordinated (reviewed) with the Boardman Fire Department and Oregon State Fire Marshal's Office.
