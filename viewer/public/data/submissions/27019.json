It is the policy of this facility to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Management and employees are commited to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, county LEPC, EPA and any other applicable authorities to mitigate the release and minimize its inpact on people and the environment.\n\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substance handled:  The primary activity at this faciltiy is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  The facility has one Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank that holds 30,000 gallons or 140,000 pounds of product at one time.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, filled into nurse tanks, and sold to farmers for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:  The worst-case scenario is the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank or rail tank car released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 140,000 pounds, which is the volume of the largest storage tank filled to 85% as limited by design capacity.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.16 miles (The Fertilizer Institute's Worst-Case Anhydrous Ammonia Releases Table 1).  There are about 400 homes and a total population of 2500 within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario:  The alternative release scenario, based on the mos likely potential incident, is a release from a transfer h"

Based on The Fertilizer Institute's Alternate-Case Releases of Anhydrous Ammonia Table 1, assuming that the release is stopped by active/passive mitigation after 2 minutes and a wind speed of 3 meters/second,  at 3500 lb/min, 7000 lb would be released effecting an 0.46 mile radius.  There are about 125 homes and a population of 750 people within the distance to the end point.\n\n\nTh general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  All employees are trained in the equipment safety features and the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\nThe five year accident history:  There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that has caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.\n\n\nThe emergency response program:  The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA standards, 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training. \nA copy of the Emergency Action Plan will be made available for the local Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The company submits annual community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facitilty.  Company personnel and the Ohio Department of Agriculture conduct periodic evaluations to assure safety equipment and procedures are being followed correctly.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
