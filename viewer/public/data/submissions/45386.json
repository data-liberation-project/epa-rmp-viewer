The total annual gallonage from all sources \r\nfor 2003 is 2.02 Billion Gallons* with a peak day of 15.7 Million Gallons*. \r\nTo supply this amount of water, we operate two surface water treatment \r\nplants the Missouri River Water Treatment Plant (MRTP) located at \r\n2560 Canyon Ferry Road, and the Ten Mile Water Treatment Plant \r\nwest of Helena at 1115 Rimini Road. The Ten mile Water Plant is in operation \r\nyear round while the MRTP is used only during the summer months for peak demands.  \r\nAdditional water is obtained from the Hale system, which consists of the \r\nOro-Fino and Eureka infiltration galleries. The department's two treatment plants \r\nare maintained, evaluated and upgraded to stay abreast of advancements \r\nin technology, health science and governmental regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Helena water distribution system consists of six finished water \r\nstorage reservoirs \r\n(Malben, Winne, Hale and Upper Hale, Woolston and Knob Hill the newest\r\n completed 2002) and pumping stations (Forest Estates, Hale, Eureka, \r\nDahlhausen, Reeders Village) linked together with 185 miles of water \r\ntransmission and distribution pipelines. The Chessman (530 MG) \r\nand Scott (195 MG) reservoirs in the Ten Mile Watershed also provide \r\nadditional water for the Ten Mile Water Plant during low flows. \r\nThese reservoirs are filled with spring run off water.\r\n \r\nCarollo Engineers of Boise, Idaho completed a Water Master Plan Update\r\n for the City of Helena in April 1997.

All alarms and autodialers are on batteries, \r\nuninterruptible power supplies, and back up electrical generator.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario would be the total loss of one ton of chlorine through \r\ncatastrophic valve or tank failure. Response time could be so limited \r\n(less than 15 minutes) that under the right conditions total loss of one ton \r\nof chlorine is possible. \r\n\r\nAlternate Scenario\r\n\r\nValve failure or leak while tank is being worked on. Disregarding minor releases \r\nthe less worst-case scenario would be CPRV failure, CPRV to tank connection, \r\nor tank valve leak. Operators would close the tank valve either shutting chlorine \r\noff or reducing the flow to a manageable level for repairs.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention.\r\n\r\nOperators are trained in the proper way to change CPRV's and tanks. Regular \r\nmaintenance is kept on the CPRV's, lines, and feeders. Cylinders with \r\nexceptionally difficult or tight valves are rejected and returned. \r\nSelf contained breathing apparatus and tanks are kept in a separate \r\nadjacent room along with emergency oxygen. Operators are trained in proper \r\nleak detection and correction. Two operators are required for tank \r\nchanges or repairs. \r\nA third operator is notified of any leaks and told to notify emergency \r\nresponders if communication is lost for more than 20 minutes. To prevent \r\na chlorine release it is standard operating procedure to have two operators \r\nwork on tank changes or to work on the Chlorine Pressure Reducing Valves (CPRV's). \r\nAn emergency repair kit is stored close to the cylinders. \r\nSelf Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) is stored in an adjacent room. \r\nThey are wall mounted with quick release brackets. An oxygen cylinder is \r\nalso stored by the SCBA's. Regular maintenance is performed on all \r\nchlorination equipment and safety equipment.

      "SummaryText": "t. \r\nPhase one of this update determined that the existing Missouri River \r\nTreatment Plant should be rehabilitated or replaced due to age of equipment, \r\npublic health risks, and operational safety issues. Plant replacement or \r\nrehabilitation costs are significant. This past year the Missouri River \r\nTreatment Plant just received new filters and media, along with an \r\nautomation upgrade. In addition to those upgrades the City of Helena has\r\ncontracted with an Engineering firm,HDR in 2004 to update our Water Master \r\nPlan. Also we are in talks with the United States Bureau of Reclamation to\r\nrenew our contract for water from the Missouri River for another 40 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Facility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThis is a local government owned and operated facility for the production \r\nof potable water for the City of Helena. The only reportable regulated \r\nsubstance for the RMP plan is chlorine. Two to eight tons of chlorine are \r\nstored at this facility in 150# and ton cylinders. No more than two ton cylinders \r\nare on line at a time. One cylinder is in actual use and the other is in standby. \r\nThe online tanks are on tank mounted isolated regulators called Chlorine Pressure \r\nReducing Valves (CPRV's) that reduce the chlorine pressure to a vacuum state. \r\nChlorine feed equipment supplies a vacuum to the tanks allowing the release of \r\nchlorine to the feeders. All feed lines supply chlorine below atmospheric pressure. \r\nShould a leak develop the feeders would be unable to supply enough vacuum to \r\ncontinue the release of chlorine and the feed would stop at the CPRV attached \r\nto each tank. No flammable substances or other restricted items are stored in \r\nthe chlorine tank rooms. The room has a chlorine detector connected to an \r\nalarm panel, annunciator horn, computer, and Autodialer. All unacknowledged \r\nalarms initiate the Autodialer, which calls all on duty and off duty personnel \r\ntill acknowledged. If the alarm conditions exist after an hour \r\nit again starts"
