Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Maple Grove Fire Department which provide our emergency response services.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nReinhart Foodservice, L.L.C. utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to keep products at temperature and preserve food safety standards. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at Reinhart Foodservice, L.L.C. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia that is expected to be present in this system is 14,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nReinhart Foodservice, L.L.C. has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA, and the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.
