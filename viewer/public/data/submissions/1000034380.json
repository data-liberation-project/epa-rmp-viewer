              "Description": "The Commercial Products Unit (CPU) is divided into 2 sections, the East CPU and the West CPU. The West CPU contains a number of fractionation columns used to purify feedstocks, blendstocks, and crude finished products from other units. The East CPU contains the covered chemicals listed under this section. The East CPU generally uses hydrogen sulfide and olefins to make crude mercaptans, which are then purified in the West CPU. The East CPU uses several different systems to produce the crude products. The East CPU systems are collectively covered by the specific prevention program outlined in this section and the general prevention program covered in the executive summary. (Note - data element 7.3: While there are ongoing reviews of safety information as a result of MOC changes, the date of the last PHA was the date of the last comprehensive review of the safety information for the unit. This is in conjunction with the instructions for section 7.3 from the RMP Submit User's Manual.)",

The Borger Plant is located in Borger, TX, and is situated on approximately 60 acres. The plant was initially built by Phillips Petroleum and began operating in 1944 as the Philtex Experiment Station. The Philtex Experiment Station became the Philtex Plant and underwent a major expansion in 1959. \n\n\n\nThe plant produces a variety of specialty chemicals such as organo-sulfur compounds, high purity hydrocarbons, solvents, diversified organic chemicals, and aromatic polymers. These products are primarily intermediates which customers use to produce finished consumer products such as plastics, solvents and odorants. Since the original RMP filing, the use of allyl alcohol and piperidine have been discontinued and removed from this report. Chemicals used at the facility that exceed the RMP threshold quantity include flammable mixtures which may contain butane, 1,3-butadiene, ethyl chloride, propylene,1-butene, 2-butene, ethyl mercaptan, 2-methylpropene, isobutene, isopentane; and toxics such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and methyl mercaptan. Since the last filing, reference to the Ryton facility has been removed because it was sold to another company on 12/31/2014.  Ryton was not required to be covered under RMP process. \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Management at the Borger Plant complies with the requirements of both the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulation. The Borger Plant manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization. Procedures for employee involvement are detailed in site procedure POL-6020 - Implementation Roles and Responsibilities for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.
