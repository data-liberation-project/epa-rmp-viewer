The Borger Plant is located in Borger, TX, and is situated on approximately 60 acres. The plant was initially built by Phillips Petroleum and began operating in 1944 as the Philtex Experiment Station. The Philtex Experiment Station became the Philtex Plant and underwent a major expansion in 1959. \n\n\n\nThe plant produces a variety of specialty chemicals such as organo-sulfur compounds, high purity hydrocarbons, solvents, diversified organic chemicals, and aromatic polymers. These products are primarily intermediates which customers use to produce finished consumer products such as plastics, solvents and odorants. Since the original RMP filing, the use of allyl alcohol and piperidine have been discontinued and removed from this report. Chemicals used at the facility that exceed the RMP threshold quantity include flammable mixtures which may contain butane, 1,3-butadiene, ethyl chloride, propylene,1-butene, 2-butene, ethyl mercaptan, 2-methylpropene, isobutene, isopentane; and toxics such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and methyl mercaptan. Since the last filing, reference to the Ryton facility has been removed because it was sold to another company on 12/31/2014.  Ryton was not required to be covered under RMP process. \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Management at the Borger Plant complies with the requirements of both the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulation. The Borger Plant manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization. Procedures for employee involvement are detailed in site procedure POL-6020 - Implementation Roles and Responsibilities for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.

These teams drive safety by focusing individual work groups on safety activities and issues in their area.\n\n\n\n     2)    Process Safety Information (PSI) management is managed according to the standards outlined in EHS-6155 - Process Safety Information. This procedure assigns responsible positions for documentation required for demonstration of compliance with OSHA and EPA standards.\n\n\n\n     3)    Site procedure POL-6010 - Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provides site-specific details on the conduct and disposition of all unit PHAs. The policy references corporate PHA procedures. The relevant procedures provide oversight and management of the performance of PHAs. Instructions include relevant timelines for report development and review, procedures for recommendation development and tracking, and final report issuance. The corporate procedures for conduct of PHAs and the qualitative assessment of risk include consideration of off-site consequences and harm to the environment or the public. PHAs meet both OSHA and EPA standards for risk identification and analysis.\n\n\n\n     4)    Operating procedures are developed, reviewed and kept current by personnel experienced in the operation of that portion of the unit or in the specific job or task.

The EOC has the authority to request assistance from outside mutual aid contracts.  Also, the Borger Plant offers assistance through the mutual aid contracts to offsite emergencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Borger facility had one accidental release in the last five years. This release occurred on 15 March 2011, discharging 535 gallons of MeSH/DMS mixture into the atmosphere. There were no injuries or damage either onsite or offsite.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAs part of the Borger Plant commitment to continuously improving the safety of our processes, some of the initiatives and mea"

      "SummaryText": "sures that have been completed or are on-going include:\n\n\n\n     1)    Completed a risk-based Building Siting study based on OSHA and API RP guidelines to determine the risk to building occupants from external explosion, fire, or toxic release and developed a plan.\n\n\n\n     2)    Adding Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) meeting ANSI/ISA-84.01-1996 and IEC 61511 standards to the processes as determined by hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) reviews.\n\n\n\n     3)    To monitor the overall effectiveness of the facility's PSM programs, Process Safety Metrics are generated monthly. Metrics are periodically reviewed with all units, departments, and Borger Leadership Team.\n\n\n\n     4)    Plant equipment is being assessed for possible Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) and corrective and preventative measures are being taken to address this potential hazard when necessary.\n\n\n\n     5)    A significant, multi-year, multi-functional effort to improve the Mechanical Integrity (MI) documentation and procedures has been initiated.\n\n\n\n     6)    Systems are being implemented to identify and confirm \"master\" values for PSI required by 29 CFR 1910:119 PSM standards. The master values will be used to check and update data stored in the various database storage systems.\n\n\n\n     7)    A current project will move the storage of propylene storage from the CPU unit to Unit 5 in order to store the propylene in a more remote location. The Propylene in Unit 5 will then be at quantities above the threshold limit, and therefore, Unit 5 will be added back to this report at the completion of the project. The associated information for CPU and Unit 5 will be updated accordingly at that time. \n\n"
