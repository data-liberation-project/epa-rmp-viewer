This includes the manufacturing and packaging of grease and specialty oils. The manufacturing process utilizes refined oils, combined with additives to produce lubricants and lubricating products.  Regulated substances are received in bulk from tank trucks or as packaged in 55 gallon drums. Both bulk and packaged raw materials are stored inside the plant in either a storage tank or in sprinkled storage.  \n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant has adopted continuous improvement principles to support an incident free culture. Incidents are investigated with identification of assignable root causes.  Preventative and corrective measures are employed to lessen the chance of a repeat incident from occurring.  To further mitigate the possibility of an incident, the plant culture has an engaged workforce that proactively identifies incidents before they occur. These near misses are investigated and findings tracked to resolution.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, by utilizing a behavior based safety system, the employees observe work tasks of their peers, both in their own work area as well as in other work areas.  We also ensure that we have experienced and cold eyes reviews of processes to further mitigate the possibility of a workplace incident. These activities are strongly supported by management in the plant who also participate as observers. Trending analysis of incidents and near miss incidents is used to identify target areas where more proactive behavior based observations are required to more effectively deploy resources for maximum impact.\n\n\n\nThe plant maintains permits for discharge of wastewater (POTW) and storm water (NPDES), and an air operating permit (minor). To maintain the effectiveness of permit compliance, routine checks of systems performance, auditing by employees external to the plant as well as proper oversight of work "

The Olathe Grease Plant is also subject to Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) Tier II filing for toxic chemicals.

These scenarios are useful for emergency planning in the event of an accident. There are two types of scenarios required by the EPA. The worst case scenario (WCS) is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance. It assumes the worst case meteorology that would allow the release to travel the greatest distance. The alternative release scenario (ARS) allows companies to develop a more realistic planning scenario.\n\n\n\nThe WCS for toxics at the Olathe Grease Plant involve the release of toluene-diisocyanate (TDI) from an indoor storage vessel. The ARS for toxics involve the release of toluene-diisocyanate (TDI) and cyclohexylamine (CHA). Offsite impact is mitigated by our prevention programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Release Prevention & Emergency Response. \n\n\n\nThe Olathe Grease Plant takes a systematic, proactive approach to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

The document details the response activities and notifications necessary in the event of a spill. The notification requirements include both internal and external community stakeholders. Small spills of the regulated substances are handled by trained plant personnel. Larger spills will be handled by outside emergency responders or a pre-qualified oil spill response organization.

This ensures our contractors meet or exceed our requirements for safety, health and environmental programs. We believe this review reduces the likelihood of an accidental release.  Additionally, we have established a program which supports an ongoing relationship with critical contractors.  This program involves periodic facility tours, stewardship of SHE metrics, sharing of behavioral based safety observations, and resolution of any findings.
