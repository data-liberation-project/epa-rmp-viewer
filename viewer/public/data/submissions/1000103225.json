Throughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, toxic gas\nsensors, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate\nexposure to hazards. Infrastructure security improvements at designated areas in the plant have\nbeen implemented that provide layers of protection against deliberate man-made incidents in\naccordance with applicable elements of U.S. Department of Homeland Security's CFATS Risk\nBased Performance Standards.\n\nIn the past five years, Thatcher Company has had no accidental releases. \n\nTCSLC has developed an Emergency Response Plan (SOP EHS-13).
