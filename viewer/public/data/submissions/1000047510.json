The CUPA requested any Air Operating permit be considered as Title V so the Freon ARBRMPR3 number was input, and they also requested a small seasonal creek/ditch be added as an environmental receptor for the worst case. Since 2009 there have been several expansions and increased inventory of NH3. These changes included adding compressors, evaporative condensers, rooms, High Pressure Receiver and Hydro-coolers.\n\nThis RMP resubmission includes; revised Executive Summary and Registration, Offsite Consequence Analysis, 5 year Accident History, Prevention Program 3 dates, and change to Emergency Action Plan. Our employees will evaluate, evacuate, notify and take defensive mitigation actions without entering a hazardous area. A current detailed copy of RMP, and Prevention Program including PHA materials can be reviewed at the facility by contacting Lawrence or Tim Sambado.\n\n \n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). This facility will not make specific RMP or OCA information available to the public until a final ruling is made. Any accidental or authorized release of information in section 2-5 by government officials violates Federal Law.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at A Sambado & Son, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handle"

We have 1 regulated substance above federal thresholds present at our facility.  The substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) NH3.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as refrigerant in a closed loop flooded ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, alternative release scenario analysis we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp software.  The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used as a reference.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest vessel.  In this scenario Ammonia (anhydrous) is released from the largest High Pressure receiver #5.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  There are no mitigation measures since this HPR is outside.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. All liquid releases can be contained on-site. Two small seasonal creek/ditch are within the distance to toxic endpoint in the worst case release. They are not public recreational areas.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a gas release typical of a compressor shaft seal failure.  The scenario involves a gas release from a ? inch diameter hole with a pressure of 181 PSIG/95?F. The release rate is 12 pounds/min. inside an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint"

The oldest part of the facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition and then applicable later building codes associated with each expansion.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nA Sambado & Son, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. This includes updated and current P&ID's.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is ?What if Checklist?.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 yrs..  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 02/4/14.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, A Sambado & Son, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nA Sambado & Son, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in"
