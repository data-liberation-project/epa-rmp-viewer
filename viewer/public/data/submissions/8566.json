We use a combination of resources including personnel training, consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the different refinery processes.  We have accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n7 A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n7 A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n7 An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n7 A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n7 An overview of our emergency response program\n7 An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n7 The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n7 The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n \n \n FACILITY DESCRIPTION, STATIONARY SOURCE, AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n \n PRSOC Refinery produces and distributes petroleum lubricants and distillate products from Reduced Crude and Crude Oil Feedstock's.

The PRSOC Refinery  have an Environmental Quality Board CAA Permit #PFE-TV-2911-0397-0025.\n \n The PRSOC Refinery uses the following flammable chemical that has been identified as regulated under the EPA's RMP rule with the potential to cause offsite consequences in the event of an accidental release:\n \n Propane - Used for refrigeration purposes in the MEK Unit.  It is also used as fuel in the Utilities Unit especially during start up and shutdown operations.  We have two propane storage bullets, one located at the MEK Unit Area, which contains 121,000 Lbs. (full capacity) and the other propane storage bullet located at the Utilities Area, which contains 142,000 Lbs. (full capacity).\n \n No regulated toxic material is handled or stored in quantities above the threshold limit values established for reporting by the regulation.\n \n \n HAZARD ASSESSMENT PROGRAM\n \n The hazard assessment program of EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.   The EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guideline was used for the calculation of the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) results. It is important to understand that this scenario is based on the regulatory guidelines and it is calculated using the EPA rules.  The worst-case scenario associated with a release of a flammable substance in Program 3 processes at the Refinery, a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), follows:\n \n \n Worst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n \n A catastrophic rupture of the second largest propane vessel of the refinery occurs releasing the total content (121,000 Lbs.) of the flammable substance.  This release forms a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the vessel. This event would have off-site consequences. The largest propane vess"

A Pre-Startup Safety Review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n \n Compliance Audits\n \n Corporate compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  This ensures that the Process Safety Program is being maintained as required.  This is accomplished by conducting a formal evaluation and certification.  The Refinery Process Safety Manager follows up on the programs on a regular basis to verify compliance of the elements of the PSM program. \n \n Incident Investigation\n \n The purpose of an Incident Reporting and Investigation procedure is to establish a consistent and effective system of internal reporting.   It is also the means for investigation and follow up of all undesired events that resulted, or could have resulted, in physical harm to people, loss of production, or harm to the environment so that the potential for the recurrence of such events is minimized.  An incident investigation committee that collects the facts and data of the incident that occurred conducts the incident investigation.  This committee will then analyze the data to identify immediate and root causes.  Based on these findings, appropriate actions will be taken to reduced or eliminate future incidents.  These action items will be followed up to ensure proper implementation.\n \n Hot Work Permit\n \n PRSOC Refinery develops implements and maintains an effective system of safe work permit procedures, which shall include the requirements set forth in the different types of work in the refinery.  The Hot Work permit is a written authorization to proceed with maintenance or construction activities after the review of the status and conditions of the equipment or area. The haz"

The refinery employs contractors to supplement its work force during normal periods or periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Contractor safety procedures are coordinated and implemented by the Refinery Contractor Representative.  Evaluation of the Contractors safety record and training program is used in selecting the Contracting Company.  The safety regulations require Contractors to train their employees in the safe work practices and safety rules of the refinery.  Contractors are also required to report any safety hazards that the contract work may cause for the facility or any hazards found by the contract employees.  \n \n \n SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \n As part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-risk reduction and safety measures as specific prevention steps:\n \n General:\n \n Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards\n Equipment designed with pressure safety relief valves\n Technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams  \n All process modifications reviewed for safety & health impacts\n Television surveillance capabilities\n Redundant control systems\n Inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, and safety interlocks\n Testing and inspection of all boilers by state inspectors Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs\n Employees/Management Health & Safety Committee\n Computer based training programs\n Scheduled safety inspections\n Safety showers and eyewash stations\n Self-contained breathing apparatus located in process units \n Substance abuse program and random drug test"
