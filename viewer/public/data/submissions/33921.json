We invest significant time and money into maintaining our refrigeration system and facilities. Over the course of the last year we have made significant refrigeration operation and safety enhancements by investing in a technologically advance energy management system with remote accessibility by key personnel, additional ammonia detection in each room, and 24 hour direct alert. Our Chief Engineer handles most day to day operations of our refrigeration system. Each year we review, repair, and audit all critical refrigeration components. In addition, our Chief Engineer receives annual training with regards to emergency response. We utilize the services of a qualified ammonia refrigeration contractor for major repairs.\n\n\n\nThrough efforts of Newport St. Paul Cold Storage?s Safety committee we have a detailed emergency response plan.
