      "SummaryText": "VALLEY FRESH, INC.\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\nJune 1999\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nValley Fresh, Inc. Poultry Plant (Valley Fresh) prepared a chemical risk management program (RMP) in general accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq.  The regulations are also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 68.  \n\nValley Fresh prepared an RMP to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Valley Fresh incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Valley Fresh personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on support services provided by the local fire department and hazardous materials response team.  Valley Fresh will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP.\n\nValley Fresh is located at 680 D Street in Turlock, California. The facility is located on approximately two acres bordered on the east by 5th Street, Americold cold storage to the south, 7th Street and Foster Poultry Farms to the west, and D Street to the north.  The properties surrounding the facility have industrial businesses to the east and north and residences to the south and west of the facility. \n\nThe facility was constructed in 1958 for Turlock Refrigeration.  Valley Fresh purchased the plant in 1969 and updated the ammonia refrigeration system in 1983. Operations at the facility"

The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and has a secured entrance that is staffed by security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.  The ammonia refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides cooling for production areas, product, water chilling, and ice making. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, and compressor controls.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  The Valley Fresh facility reported no accidental releases of ammonia during the past five years.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Valley Fresh facility due to the quantity of ammonia used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \u0005the greatest amount held in a single vessel\u0005released as a gas over 10 minutes.  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThe largest ammonia vessel at Valley Fresh, the high-pressure receiver, has a capacity of 7,000 pounds of ammonia at 80 percent liquid level, the safe fill level for the vessel.  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for the facility is a release of 7,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.  Catastrophic failure of the high-pressure receiver would be required for this scenario to occur.  As required by the RMP regulatio"

      "SummaryText": "ns, pessimistic atmospheric conditions, very conservative chemical dispersion characteristics, and a toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm) ammonia vapor were assumed.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case release scenario is 0.55 miles, or approximately 2,880 feet.  The SLAB Model was used for modeling the worst case release scenario.  SLAB was first developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.  SLAB has been revised and updated by the USAF Engineering and Services Center and the American Petroleum Institute.  SLAB is commonly used to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of denser-than-air releases.\n\nValley Fresh used the alternative release scenario described in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998.  The release scenario is described as a <-inch effective diameter orifice leaking liquid ammonia and resulting in an airborne release, representative of a pipe connection leak or a gasket rupture.  The evaluation used a release rate of 88.9 pounds/minute and average weather conditions.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.08 miles, or 399 feet.  The SLAB Model was used also for modeling the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Valley Fresh has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Valley Fresh ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditio"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to: formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lock-out/tag-out program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP auditing and inspection program.  Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the ammonia system at the facility.  The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nValley Fresh is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment.
