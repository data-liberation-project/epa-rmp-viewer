We installed external visual and audible aids for any leak detection alert at the Henry Fork Plant in March, 1998. \n\no A new, updated toxic gas leak detector was installed at the Northeast Plant in March, 1999. \n\no The site's Emergency Response Plans (ERP) have been significantly upgraded in 1997. The ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. The Catawba County LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to notify businesses or residences that may be impacted by a release.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Hickory has had an active Safety Committee. There is a Utility representative on the Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. Sean Hovis, Risk Manager for the City of Hickory, also takes an active role in supporting the Utilities Safety Program.
