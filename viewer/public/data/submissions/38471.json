There have been no chlorine or sulfur dioxide incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\nIn 1995 and 1996, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plants with the assistance of two consulting organizations. A PSM Implementation Manual was edited to be site specific and issued to the plants. \n\nKey items included in the manual were:\n\no Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits; and\no Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide safety information as required by the regulations.\no Standard Operating Procedures for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Management\n\nThese manual were updated in 1999 to comply with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).

We installed external visual and audible aids for any leak detection alert at the Henry Fork Plant in March, 1998. \n\no A new, updated toxic gas leak detector was installed at the Northeast Plant in March, 1999. \n\no The site's Emergency Response Plans (ERP) have been significantly upgraded in 1997. The ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. The Catawba County LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to notify businesses or residences that may be impacted by a release.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Hickory has had an active Safety Committee. There is a Utility representative on the Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. Sean Hovis, Risk Manager for the City of Hickory, also takes an active role in supporting the Utilities Safety Program. Mr. Hovis uses support from the city's insurance carrier and an outside consulting firm, currently Operations Excellence Consulting, Inc., to implement a city wide safety program.\n\nWithin the Utilities department, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n- Lockout/Tagout\n- Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plants have had an excellent safety record. We plan to continue our emphasis on safety to maintain and improve our safety performance.\n\nReport by:\n\nGene Hayes\nDirector of Utilities\nCity of Hickory, North Carolina"
