The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source: The Englewood Water District wastewater treatment facility was built to chlorinate wastewater and is located at 140 Telman Road in Charlotte County Florida.  The station includes a chlorine storage area, which contains liquid chlorine containers, chlorinators, and various types of related safety equipment.  A maximum of 4 one-ton containers of chlorine are found in the chlorine storage area (two on-line and two for backup.)  One 2 ton-cylinder is connected to the chlorination system on site at any given time.  The facility is occupied and staffed 24 hours a day 7 days a week, and qualifies as a Program 3 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.\n\nb.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled: The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to give Englewood Water District Employees concise guidelines in the event of an accidental chlorine-related release at the Telman Road facility.  The Englewood Water District emergency response program is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program (\"ERP\") requirements.\n\nc.    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: The Englewood Water District accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n?High level training of the operators\n\n?Preventive maintenance program\n\n?Use of industry standard process and safety equipment\n\n?Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n\n?Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures\n\nChlorine-specific prevention steps include:\n\n?Training in the practices of safe chlorine handling\n\n?The availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by operators \n\n?Awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine\n\n?Presence of chlorine detectors.\n\nd.
