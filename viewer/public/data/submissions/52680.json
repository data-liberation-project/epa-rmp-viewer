      "SummaryText": "JEA NORTHSIDE GENERATING STATION\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nRE-SUBMITTAL: September 2008\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe JEA Northside Generating Station (NGS) is located at 4377 Hecksher Drive, Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida.  The NGS facility is one of three electrical generating stations located throughout the city that is part of the JEA Power Business Unit.  JEA is committed to operating this facility and other JEA systems and facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of JEA and Contractor employees, the public and the environment.  In addition, JEA is committed to operating this and other JEA facilities in full compliance with all applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the RMP-covered System is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, JEA has developed this RMP plan.  Among the important components of this RMP plan is JEA's Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the Facility.\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe JEA NGS facility operates one system that contains aqueous ammonia (concentration greater than 20%)- the West Tank System.  The West Tank System is the only RMP-covered process at NGS containing over the 20,000-pound threshold amount of aqueous ammonia.  Aqueous ammonia is stored in a single tank containing 40,282 gallons of the solution of which 30% is aqueous ammonia.  The maximum inventory is therefore 91,000 pounds.  The aboveground aqueous ammonia storage tank is completely surrounded by a concrete containment dike.\n\nThe electric generating Units 1 and 2 are equipped with an aqueous ammonia injection system designed to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission to acceptable limits.  This system is referred to as the West Tank System.  The ammonia is injected into the process at the hot cyclone inlets of each boiler to reduce NOx emissions"

      "FacilityID": 52680,
      "SummaryText": ".\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program 2 contains the following elements: a Process Hazard Review of the process, the collection and documentation of Process Safety Information, a Preventative Maintenance Program, written Operating Procedures, a Compliance Audits program, Safety Training for operations and maintenance personnel, and an Incident Investigation procedure.  This Prevention Program will ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The RMP Prevention Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe NGS facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe NGS has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The current plan has been coordinated with the City of Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department (JFRD) and the Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Region 4 Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911.  JEA is currently in the process of revising the facility's plan.  The JFRD is presently responsible for determining when evacuation of off-site areas is necessary and for public notification.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNGS will implement the recommended action items from the Compliance Audit and Process Hazard Review conducted in 2008."
