This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces products used by the friction materials, and coatings industries using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:\n\n1. epichlorohydrin\n2. ethylenediamine\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQ"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe worst case scenario is the complete rupture of the completely full epichlorohydrin tank.  The tank contents would be released immediately into the secondary containment diked area.  Using the EPA OCA methodology, the material would evaporate at a rate of 22.7 lb./min., and would create an area with concentrations above the  toxic threshold out to a distance of 0.6 miles (3190 ft.).  The list of potentially impacted receptors is:\n1. AFA Pallet\n2. NJ Transit bus repair facility\n3. Sun Chemical facility\n4. Reichold Chemical facility\n5. General Chemical facility\n6. Darling Delaware facility\n7. Passaic Valley Sewage Authority\n8. Newark Bay Cogeneration facility  \n9. Miles Inc. facility\n10. Louis Dreyfus Energy\n11. Texaco sales Terminal\n12. Amerada Hess\n\nAdministration controls include inventory control, training, constant surveillance, preventive maintenance, and Process Safety Management measures.  Mitigation measures include the secondary containment dike, emergency response plan, training in spill control, and contacting of outside agencies and closest neighbors.     \n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n1.  For epichlorohydrin, an alternate scenario involves a failure of the unloading line while a tank wagon of the material is being unloaded to the storage tank.  It takes 1 minute to get the truck pump shut off and stop the flow from the truck.  492 lbs. are released into the tankwagon loading area dike.  Using the EPA OCA methodology, the material would evaporate at a rate of 1.89 lb./min., and would create an area with c"

Trained personnel are stationed at the tank wagon unloading area during all tank wagon unloadings. \n2. Each chemical has a specific procedure for unloading it, with all necessary precautions and safety steps specified.\n3.
