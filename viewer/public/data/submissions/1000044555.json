The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance.  The procedures include instruction for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and decontamination.  All emergency equipment is maintained following established procedures. Employees are trained in the procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders such as local law enforcement, local and state government officials, and the local emergency planning committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule.

In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel having responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are trained in those procedures.\r\n\r\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements.  Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nThis facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release to prevent a similar accident from recurring.\r\n\r\nThe Company has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.
