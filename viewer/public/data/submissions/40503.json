The plan provides for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe Cartersville Waste Water Pollution Control Plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect the final plant discharge. The chlorination process includes gaseous chlorine, chlorination equipment and process safety equipment.\n\nFor the chlorination process, accidental chlorine release modeling was done to determine potential consequences associated with an accidental chlorine release. The first worse case scenario defined by EPA states that the owner shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10-mintue period. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario. An incident history review was performed for the Water Pollution Control Plant to determine the most likely case scenario.\n\nIn each case, atmosphere dispresion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine before its concentration decrease to a theoretical toxic endpoint. This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatning health effects.\n\nThe Water Pollution Control Plant Risk Management Plan includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potentialchlorine release hazards.\n\n*Operator training\n*Preventive Maintenance Program\n*Process specific safety equipment\n*Safe and effective standard operating procedures, written with operator participation\n*Hazard Review of equipment and procedures\n*Inspection Programs\n\nFuther, The Water Pollution Control Plant has a"
