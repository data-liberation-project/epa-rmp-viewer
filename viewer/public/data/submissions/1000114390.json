This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, maintenance of the facility, and proactive risk identification and management, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \n\nThe Black Canyon Facility, located about 17 miles northwest of LaBarge, Wyoming, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes one primary operation (dehydration) to prepare the natural gas/liquid mixture for transportation to the ExxonMobil Shute Creek Facility for processing.  This facility could contain a regulated flammable mixture and a regulated toxic substance.  Transportation of natural gas regulated substances into and out of the facility is handled via pipeline.  Regulated flammable liquids are trucked out of the facility.  This facility is surrounded by rolling hills and mountains.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results \n\nIn accordance with special security guidance provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), data addressing the facility's Offsite Consequence Analyses (Worst Case Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios) are not detailed in this section.  Refer to Data Element Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this plan.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe foll"

This summary addresses each of the EPA RMP elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program for covered processes.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThis facility provides for and encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at this facility and addresses each program element.  In addition, this facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nThis facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The PSI information is updated through the MOC process based on the regular design improvements to maintain safe operations. The Engineering Group is responsible for coordinating PSI updates.\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, this facility has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, l"

This facility ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\nThis facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThis facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the facility utilized a PHA Baseline Guideword HAZOP, an industry- accepted hazard evaluation technique for RMP and PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of facility operating/maintenance personnel, facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures including comparison to industry standard updates.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering, operations personnel, and management.  Operations personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on relative risk. Resolution plans are tracked until completed through the company action r"

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in the digitalized action tracking system.\n\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design, this facility updates and revalidates the process hazard analysis at least every 5 years.  The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented and retained in the digitalized action tracking system.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThis facility maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations (e.g., startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown) and provide guidance on how to respond to upper/lower limit exceedances for specific equipment or process parameters. Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and validated.  The Competency Assurance Standard (CAS) provides guidance and electronic tools to ensure the procedures are maintained.  Revisions necessary to reflect changes are made through the Management of Change (MOC) process including the training of personnel for any procedural changes or updates.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Competency Assurance Standard (CAS) provides the framework to ensure operators and other employees achieve minimum required competencies to safely perform their work.  The CAS system guides development and maintenance of written operating and maintenance procedures to provide a comprehensive training program to employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then"

After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., written tests, hands-on skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.  Personnel who operate process equipment receive refresher training at least every 3 years.  This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented. In addition, specific trainings (e.g. isolation, process safety knowledge verification trainings, etc.) are provided to the operator for verification of knowledge to safely operate the plant with validation through written or verbal examination.\n\nContractors\n\nThis facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce for maintenance or construction tasks.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, procedures are in place to help ensure contractors: perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in the workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow safety rules, and inform facility personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to working in this facility which includes: a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, applicable emergency action plan provisions, and information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis (JSA) is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with facility personnel assistance as needed) prior to maintenance/construction tasks.\n\nFacility personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated during the initial selection process, and the facility supervisor conducts periodic evaluations of sa"

Changes are reviewed to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, drawings, and procedures are updated for these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided the necessary training related to the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThis facility promptly investigates incidents that resulted in (or could have reasonably resulted in) a fire, explosion, release, major equipment/property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, root causes develop recommendations, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings are tracked until completed using the digitalized action close out system.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who could be affected.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that reports can be reviewed during the next PHA cycle.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, a compliance audit is conducted at the facility at least once every 3 years to determine whether the program's procedures and practices are being implemented.
