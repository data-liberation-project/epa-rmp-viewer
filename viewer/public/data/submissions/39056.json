      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE ESSEX FACILITY\nThe Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District (HBMWD) has the utmost commitment to the safety of its employees and the surrounding public. Toward that end, preventing accidental releases of chlorine gas to the atmosphere is essential. The HBMWD's policies and practices have emphasized safety for many years, long before the OSHA Process Safety Management standard or the EPA RMP rule existed. Plant operators are highly trained to operate and maintain the chlorination system safely, and the training is ongoing. In its nearly 43-year history of using chlorine gas for water disinfection since 1960, the facility has never had a release of chlorine that endangered the public or the environment. The HBMWD will do everything in its power to perpetuate its excellent safety record. Facility personnel conduct joint safety training exercises with the Arcata Fire Department. In the case of a release or threatened release of chlorine, the Arcata Fire Department will be called immediately to respond. The facility is staffed 24 hours a day.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe HBMWD is the regional water purveyor in the Humboldt Bay area. The Essex Control Center is the main pumping and chlorination station. One-ton containers are used to supply the chorine for disinfecting the water prior to its distribution to wholesale and retail customers. Five containers are kept in the chlorination building at the facility. The chlorine is compressed gas, liquefied by pressure. Chorine gas is piped from the on line container to the piping and vacuum regulation system to be metered into the water to achieve the proper dose for disinfection.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe accidental release prevention program is described in a document titled Process Safety Management of Chlorine at Essex Control Center. The prevention program complies w"

      "SummaryText": "ith the OSHA PSM standard and the EPA RMP rule, as well as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program. Numerous prevention measures are applied to all aspects of the chlorination system. Some important examples of prevention measures include the following.\n1.    Training of personnel emphasizes maintaining and operating the chlorination system in a safe manner.\n2.    The facility is always staffed, and the night operators inspect the chlorination system every two hours.\n3.    There is a chlorine leak detector and audible alarm. As a backup to on site personnel, the alarm is telemetered to the HBMWD security contractor, who will investigate unanswered alarms.\n4.    There is a seismic sensor for additional earthquake safety.\n5.    An automatic valve shutoff system closes the valve on each chlorine container when triggered by either the chlorine detector or the seismic sensor.\n6.    A standby electric power generator powers the facility during power outages.\n7.    Established procedures are followed for the safe handling of containers while being delivered, maneuvered, and stored.\n8.    Only one chlorine container is on line, and one is on ready reserve to allow for the automatic switchover of the containers when the on line container is empty. The valves of the other containers are closed.\n9.    Pigtails are installed with the proper amount of slack and are replaced annually.\n10.    Each time a pigtail is connected to a container, a new lead washer is used and the valve and the connection are immediately tested for leaks.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no releases of chlorine that have caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nFacility personnel are trained to respond to minor chlorine leaks. In the event of a major release or threatened release of chlorine, facility personnel are trained to notify appropriate persons and agencies and to provide support to the responding personnel from the Arca"

However, improving safety is an ongoing process, and changes are made from time to time.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nThe HBMWD is committed to keeping its facilities safe for its employees and the potentially affected public and environment. The General Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements. Under the direction of the General Manager, the Superintendent plays a key role in accomplishing these objectives. In particular, the Superintendent has the responsibility for implementing the risk management program at the Essex facility on a day-to-day basis. The Superintendent involves the facility supervisors and other staff to assist with the program and in accomplishing the safe operation of the facility."
