The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Agri-Energy, LLC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.
