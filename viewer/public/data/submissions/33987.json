The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. It is the policy of Agri-Energy, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nAgri-Energy, LLC operates an ethanol fuel production plant located near Luverne, in Rock County, Minnesota. The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with soluables, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain 30 to 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance. The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 120,000 pounds. The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Agri-Energy, LLC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAgri-Energy, LLC has not had a natural gasoline accident causing death, injuries, environmental of property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last fi"
