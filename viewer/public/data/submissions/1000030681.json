      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Univar USA Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass warehousing.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Formaldehyde (solution) and Ammonia (aqueous).\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (solution) at our facility is 48,000.00 lbs. while Ammonia (aqueous) is present at our facility in maximum quantity of 150,000.00 lbs.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To evaluate the worst case scenario and alternative release scenarios analyses  we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario submitted for Program 3 and both toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from warehousing.  In this scenario 480 lbs. of Formaldehyde (solution) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 37% of the maximum capacity of the source. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.0 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L.\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Case Release Scenario for Ammonia (conc 20% "

The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by neutralization. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is 0.1 miles.                                                                                                                                                                                  The Alternative Case Release Scenario for Formaldehyde (solution) involves a release from warehousing.  The scenario involves the release of 83 lbs.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nUnivar USA Inc. mainta"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What If\" Scenario. The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/20/09.\n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Univar USA Inc. maintains written standard operating procedures (SOPs).  These SOPs address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The SOPs reviewed and certified annually and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nUnivar USA Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is conducted on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nUnivar USA Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes all warehousing equipment.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Univar USA Inc. to "

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Univar USA Inc.. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nUnivar USA Inc. conducts Compliance Audits at least every 3 years to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulations are being implemented.  The most recent Compliance Audit was conducted on 04/19/2012.  Any corrective actions required as a result of these audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nUnivar USA Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a Regulated Substance.  These investigations are undertaken within 48 hours of the incident.  The purpose of the investigation is to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All Incident Reports/Investigations are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nUnivar USA Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a Regulated Substance occur.\n\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\n\nUnivar USA Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been only one release involving an RMP Regulated Substance in the past 5 years at this facility.\n\n\n\n6.    Emergency Contingency Plan\n\nUnivar USA Inc. carries a written Emergency Contingency Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The Plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\n7.
