Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Univar USA Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass warehousing.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Formaldehyde (solution) and Ammonia (aqueous).\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (solution) at our facility is 48,000.00 lbs. while Ammonia (aqueous) is present at our facility in maximum quantity of 150,000.00 lbs.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To evaluate the worst case scenario and alternative release scenarios analyses  we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario submitted for Program 3 and both toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from warehousing.  In this scenario 480 lbs. of Formaldehyde (solution) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 37% of the maximum capacity of the source. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.0 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L.\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Case Release Scenario for Ammonia (conc 20% "

The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by neutralization. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is 0.1 miles.
