THE WORKERS ALWAYS USE GOGGLES AND WEAR THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS PRESENT DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS.\n\nOUR SAFETY RECORD IS OUTSTANDING AND ALLOWS US TO REPORT THAT NO INJURY ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURED AT THIS STORAGE FACILITY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND TOURS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO MAKE FIRST RESPONDERS AWARE OF THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.
