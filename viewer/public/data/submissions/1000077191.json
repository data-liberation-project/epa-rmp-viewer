Each accumulator feeds one, two, four, or six bunker mounted evaporator coils located in the Cold Storage Rooms and Pre-coolers. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates."

Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator. Any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the screw compressors.\r\n \r\nIn the pumped overfeed system, high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each liquid recirculator. Each liquid recirculator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters each liquid recirculator. Low pressure liquid is pumped from each liquid recirculator to the bunker mounted and ceiling suspended evaporators located in the Cold Storage Rooms, Hallways, and Pre-coolers.

There are three ammonia sensors installed at Sun Pacific Lerdo. Two (2) ammonia detectors are installed inside the machinery room, and one (1) inside the pump room. \r\nThe machinery room is equipped with two (2) roof-mounted ventilation fans that are continuously running that can be used to reduce the ammonia concentration inside the room in an emergency. The emergency ventilation system can be controlled manually by the ON/OFF switch located on the machinery room roof, or the emergency break glass switch outside the principal machinery room door.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Control Box (ECB) was installed in accordance with the Fire Code at the time of construction.

The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun Pacific Lerdo facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Lerdo has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Lerdo's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR \u00a75189(n)\r\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements] - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119(n)\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 \u00a72765.1-2765.2\r\n- USEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 40 CFR \u00a768.95\r\n- California Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) [Emergency Response Plans and Procedures] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4 \u00a72731\r\n- California Hazardous"

Nevertheless, Sun Pacific Lerdo continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sun Pacific Lerdo's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sun Pacific Lerdo's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Lerdo has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sun Pacific Lerdo has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the futur"

      "SummaryText": "valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing. The relief valves on the high side of the system relieve at 250 or 300 psig while the low side of the system relieves at 150 psig. Accumulators 15 and 21-29 relief valves are equipped with a rupture disc and non-resetting gauge to assist in recognizing that an overpressure event has occurred. The rupture discs are installed upstream of each relief valve and are designed to break at the relief valve set pressure. Once the rupture disc gauge has been broken, the gauge needle will move to the burst zone, indicating that the relief valve has lifted. The gauges can be manually reset. All pressure relief valves are piped to the ammonia diffusion tank sized according to the Uniform Mechanical Code at the time of construction. This tank helps mitigate many of the hazards associated with the release of ammonia through a pressure relief valve.\r\n\r\nThe liquid recirculators and main suction accumulator are equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressor.\r\n\r\nProcess Classification\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Sun Pacific Lerdo consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.
