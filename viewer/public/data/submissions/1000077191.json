Each accumulator feeds one, two, four, or six bunker mounted evaporator coils located in the Cold Storage Rooms and Pre-coolers. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates."

Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator. Any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the screw compressors.\n\n \n\nIn the pumped overfeed system, high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each liquid recirculator. Each liquid recirculator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters each liquid recirculator. Low pressure liquid is pumped from each liquid recirculator to the bunker mounted and ceiling suspended evaporators located in the Cold Storage Rooms, Hallways, and Pre-coolers.

There are three ammonia sensors installed at Sun Pacific Lerdo. Two (2) ammonia detectors are installed inside the machinery room, and one (1) inside the pump room. \n\nThe machinery room is equipped with two (2) roof-mounted ventilation fans that are continuously running that can be used to reduce the ammonia concentration inside the room in an emergency.

All pressure relief valves are piped to the ammonia diffusion tank sized according to the Uniform Mechanical Code at the time of construction. This tank helps mitigate many of the hazards associated with the release of ammonia through a pressure relief valve.\n\n\n\nThe liquid recirculators and main suction accumulator are equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation.
