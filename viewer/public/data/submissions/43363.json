Therefore, this summary addressees each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The Facility is in the continuous process of reviewing the Accident Prevention Program and as such is in various stages of implementing changes to improve work place safety.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility\u00bfs PSM program is an important step forward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. Employees involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI)concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). The PSI will be useful to the operator; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training: contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemicals properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemicals-specific information. Including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheet(MSDSs).\n\n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various  processes are identified and controlled.

However , as situations warrant the facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and failure mode and effect or the deductive fault tree technique. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team. The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency). This ranking helps ensure that potential response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.
