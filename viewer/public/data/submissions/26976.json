      "SummaryText": "Sysco Food Services of Dallas is a distributor of a wide variety of both equipment and food products to the restaurant industry.  The system described in this submittal is a refrigeration system utilized in the warehousing of frozen food products.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the chemical of concern.  It is used as the refrigerant in the system.  A total of 20,000 pounds of ammonia is recirculated and/or stored in the system.  The design and construction of the system is in accordance with the applicable guidelines and recommendations of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The system is continuously monitored and inspected by technicians who are qualified and trained in accordance with the requirements OSHA, 1910.119.  These operators continuously monitor the system for any indication of leaks or equipment problems using a process control system and permanent, continuous ammonia detectors capable of distinguishing the presence of ammonia in the atmosphere down to a few parts per million.  In addition, the system is visually inspected via a walk-through checklist on a daily basis.  Any indication of deviation from process set points or leaks would result in the immediate isolation of the problem from the remainder of the system for prompt repair.  Design, maintenance, repair, and operation of the system are conducted in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals).  In the event that a leak should occur in the system in spite of precautions taken, the system is equipped with ammonia detectors which are located at strategic points throughout the facility.  These ammonia detectors will sound an alarm and alert the operators upon detect"

      "SummaryText": "ing an ammonia level in the air greater than twenty-five (25) parts per million, which is well below the OSHA Permissible Exposure Level of fifty (50) parts per million.  \n\nFor the purposes of this submittal, to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Environmental Protection Agency requires that the facility submit a worst case release scenario.  This is the complete release of liquid ammonia from the vessel in the system designated as the high pressure receiver in a time period of ten minutes.  The worst case release would result in an ammonia release of approximately 10,000 pounds in the ten-minute period, which would result in off-site impacts.  This ammonia refrigeration system was started in 2002, and as such, has no accident history to summarize.  \n\nSysco Food Services of Dallas has implemented an Emergency Response Plan to be followed in the event of an accident or release.  This Emergency Response Plan describes the notification protocol to be used in the event of an ammonia release, and the response action to be taken to contain or stop the release.  The notifications in the event of a sudden release of over 100 lbs of ammonia would include the local fire department, the Denton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the State Emergency Response Commission, and the National Response Center.  The fire department and the Denton County LEPC have been provided with copies of the Emergency Response Plan."
