      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Whiting Clean Energy Cogeneration facility in Whiting, Indiana owned and operated by Primary Energy are in the process of installing a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit which will utilize ammonia for reduction of NOx emissions. The ammonia for use in the SCR process will be stored in a 6,000-gallon storage tank located at the facility. At full capacity, the tank can store 29,000 pounds of ammonia. Since the facility will be storing more than 10,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia, the SCR ammonia process is subject to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations codified in 40CFR Part 68.\n\nAmmonia is an easily liquefiable colorless gas with a sharp, intensely irritating odor. It is listed by the USEPA as a regulated toxic substance for release prevention.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nPursuant to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), Primary Energy has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to ammonia.  The facility completed detailed Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) through checklist analyses and a complete Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The PHA was completed in April 2001 using technical and operations staff from the facility as well as experienced facilitators from URS Corporation, an outside consulting firm.\n\nPrimary Energy is committed to the safe operation of SCR ammonia system at the Whiting facility. Primary Energy\u00bfs implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes preventive maintenance programs (mechanical inte"
