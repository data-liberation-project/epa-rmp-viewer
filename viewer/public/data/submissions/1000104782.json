Pre-Start-up Safety Review: a pre start-up safety review will be completed for all new ammonia projects prior to its start-up to verify that all safety programs are established, all the training has been completed by all individuals involved, and construction has been completed according to design standards and guidelines.\n8. Mechanical Integrity: A mechanical integrity program is established to ensure that the ammonia refrigeration system is built to the established codes and is maintained to manufacturer's recommendations.Preventive maintenance procedures are also established to ensure the refrigeration system is maintained properly to minimize unexpected breakdown and failure.\n9: Hot Work Permit: A hot work program has been established and implemented so that any cutting, welding, or burning operation on the ammonia refrigeration system must be authorized by the maintenance manager or the safety manager.\n10. Management of Change: These procedures ensure that the Plant Engineer and the Refrigeration Manager properly review all changes made to the systems.\n11. Incident Investigation: These procedures ensure that any incident ( and near missed ) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\n12. Compliance Audit: An audit of the Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Plan will be performed on a regular schedule to ensure that the program  is being continually implemented and working properly.\n13.
