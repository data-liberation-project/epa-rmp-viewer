At this facility, ammonia and aqueous ammonia are used. These chemicals are considered hazardous by  the EPA. Certain safety precautions in handling ammonia are necessary in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby  members of the community. These safety  precautions are dependent upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety  devices inherent in the design of this facility and the training of our personnel.\nIt is the policy of Rockwood to comply with all applicable federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, and to conduct its business in an environmentally sound manner that avoids any  unreasonable adverse impact on the environment or the neighboring community.  In keeping with this policy, Rockwood has developed and implemented a risk management program to ensure the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The risk management program includes procedures (1) to identify potentially hazardous chemicals at the facility, (2) for maintaining a safe working environment that helps prevent the accidental release of hazardous chemicals, and (3) for minimizing the consequences of an accidental release should one occur.  \nStationary  Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThis facility produces pigments of various types and colors. The major processes at this facility  include storage of materials, crystal dissolution, mixture/formulation, drying, calcining, and product handling. Raw materials are delivered to this facility by trucks."

      "SummaryText": "RMP regulated chemicals handled by this facility are aqueous ammonia and anhydrous ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia is used for pH control in the process. Aqueous ammonia is used as a process reactant.\nAnhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility by tank trucks. It is unloaded into a 30,000 gallon storage tank. Administrative controls require that the tank be filled to no more than 80% of its capacity.\nThe aqueous ammonia storage tank is surrounded by a containment dike. Based on tank capacity, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this facility  is 124,000 pounds (80% of one storage tank). The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia that can be stored is 52,000 pounds. The amounts of both aqueous ammonia and anhydrous ammonia stored on site exceed the RMP threshold quantities. Anhydrous ammonia is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. For these reasons, the anhydrous ammonia is subject to the RMP Program 3 requirements. Rockwood has chosen to include aqueous ammonia in the RMP Program 3 also.\nWorst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\nWorst-Case\nThe worst-case release scenario, by definition, is the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be released from the storage tank and the ancillary piping over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be released is 124,000 pounds, the capacity of the storage tank. For a worst case scenario, it is assumed that there are no mitigating measures. Under this scenario, the distance to the toxic endpoint using the RMP Comp model is estimated at 3.6 miles.\nAlternate-Cases\nThe first alternate-case, and most likely, release scenario is defined as a blown gasket in the ammonia system. The ammonia release rate is estimated at 21.2 pounds per minute. Active mitigation measures are not considered in this scenario since the release could occur at any  location within the facility. Under this scenario, the distance to the toxic endpoint using the"

      "SummaryText": "RMP Comp model is estimated at 0.1 miles or 528 feet. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility's plant boundary.\nThe second alternate-case release scenario is defined as a release of 29% aqueous ammonia from a pump packing. The aqueous ammonia release rate, of five gallons per minute, is estimated as an average transfer rate. This equates to 10.9 pounds per minute of ammonia.  Active mitigation measures are not considered in this scenario since the release could occur at a location within the facility  where mitigation measures are not available. Under this scenario, the distance to the toxic endpoint using the RMP Comp model is estimated at 0.1 miles or 528 feet.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility's plant boundary.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\nThis facility is subject to both EPA's Accidental Release Prevention program and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Under both of these programs, the facility has outlined specific procedures that it follows to prevent or minimize the release of ammonia to the environment. Specifically, the facility has performed process hazard analyses (PHA) of the anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia systems and will repeat this process at least every 5 years. The purpose of the PHA is to provide a systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards associated with the ammonia system. In addition, the facility  regularly performs training of its employees to ensure that the procedures developed for the safe use and handling of the ammonia are adhered to at all times.\nFive Year Accident History\nThis facility has not had a RMP accidental release of ammonia within the last 5 years.\nEmergency  Response Program\nThis facility has an emergency  response program, labeled as \"Emergency Procedures\".  The Emergency Response Program has been developed in coordination with the St.  Louis County  Local Emer"
