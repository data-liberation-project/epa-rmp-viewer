      "SummaryText": "he calculations are documented in the Koch Foods RMP Plan on file with the Risk Supervisor at the facility.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of MARPLOT mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2010 data as well as CAPS Circular Area Profiles with more up to date census information.\n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nKoch Foods has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements Koch Foods has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n- Accident History\n\nThere have been no ammonia related incidents at the Koch Foods facility within the last five years that have resulted in on, or off site property damage, injuries or deaths.\n\n- Emergency Action Plan\n\nKoch Foods current Emergency Action Plan focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance from local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nKoch Foods currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration processes at this time.   However, the processes will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nKoch Foods-Berteau is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Chicago Fire Department and the Cook County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration systems. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Koch Foods operations.  Due to the characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Koch Foods is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP*eSubmit text.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMPComp and EPA's RMP tables for Hazardous Release were utilized exclusively. The tables are referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the release scenario mathematical approximation process.\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of t"
