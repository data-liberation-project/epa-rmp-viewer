The training program was last reviewed on June 8, 2018. The current training program is comprised of the following:\r\n*  Initial employee training;\r\n*  Periodic refresher training;\r\n*  Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\r\n*  Competency testing involving written tests and/or observation following training; and\r\n*  Training records for each employee.\r\n\r\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, record keeping, and training. The latest equipment inspections were conducted in June 2018. The most recent review of maintenance procedures was conducted in June 2018.\r\n\r\nRMP Change Management:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The Facility RMP Management of Change (RMP MOC) procedures are used to evaluate changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Review:  The pre-startup review applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated. Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-startup safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the RMP MOC review. Additionally, a pre-startup safety review is performed in conjunction with the RMP MOC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic c"

If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Consolidated Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\r\n\r\n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n*  The Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\r\n\r\n*  Anhydrous ammonia is received in bulk and converted to aqua ammonia. These regulated substances are stored, distributed, and dispensed for direct application as crop production nutrients. \r\n\r\n*  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and loaded into a 50,000 gallon storage tank (bullet). The regulated substance is later transferred to either one 15,000-gallon storage tank or one 18,000-gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 362,627 pounds.
