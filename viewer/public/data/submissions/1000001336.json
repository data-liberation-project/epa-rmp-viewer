      "SummaryText": "The Colver Power Project is a 103.5-Megawatt MW (net) waste bituminous coal fired electric production facility.  This facility utilizes a circulating fluidized bed boiler that produces 785,000 pounds of steam per hour at 10,000F, at a pressure of 2,525 psi.  The electrical energy is supplied to General Public Utilities.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies\nColver Power Project has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Injection System used for nitrous oxide reduction.  The facilityA?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nThe anhydrous ammonia is used in oxides of nitrogen oxides (NOx) control.  This process is referred to a \"Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction\" (SNCR).  NOx are generated in the combustion chamber when waste coal is fired.  Oxides of nitrogen flow with other flue gases in the flue gas stream, out of the combustion chamber through the cyclone, cyclone outlet and backpass, baghouse and out the stack.  The NOx analyzer, located on the stack, activates the anhydrous ammonia injection system via the Bailey DCS.  Injector ports located at the cyclone inlet inject anhydrous ammonia into the flue gas stream and reduce the amount of NOx emitted into the atmosphere.  \nAnhydrous ammonia is stored onsite in a single above ground tank with a water capacity of 11,600 gallons.  The tank is located outdoors, 30 feet east of the baghouse.  Facility administrative controls limit the maximum storage capacity to no more than 82% by volume, which is equal to about 51,200 pounds or (9500 gallons) of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Two unmanned monitors (water cannons) are located strategically near the ammonia storage tank.  One is 100 feet southwest, t"

As ammonia is A?self alarmingA? due to its pungent odor, even minor releases are readily noticeable.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation\nHot Work Permit\nContractors\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n5-Year Accident History\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of Anhydrous Ammonia at the facility in the past five (5) years.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe emergency response program is based on the facilityA?s \"Preparedness and Prevention and Contingency Plan\" which includes procedures for the notification of key facility management personnel and the following agencies:\n- Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) - Ebensburg Office (Local Office)\n- Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission\n- Cambria County Emergency Management Agency\n- Cambria County Hazmat Team\n- Local Fire Department\n- Police Department\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThere are no current changes, immediate changes or improvements planned for the Anhydrous Ammonia process.
