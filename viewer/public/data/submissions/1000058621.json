The revised plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program for the ammonia system components, as well as programs for pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requiremenst for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requiremenstfor contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. Acme Markets has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented at the Denver facility. Lastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Denver facility's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.",

Acme Markets operates many retail grocery stores throughout the Eastern U.S. that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in Denver, PA. Acme Markets Refrigerated Distribution Center #8790 located on this facility employees 958 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of highly Hazardous Chemicals. \n\n\n\nAcme Markets Denver, PA distribution center stores and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage. The Denver facility has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\n\n\n\nPursuant to PSM regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Acme Markets has developed a comprehensive written PSM program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If? /Checklist Analysis developed by the International Institute of ammonia refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Denver facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm (ERM-West, Inc.), and was revalidated to meet PSM and RMP Requirements in 2014.\n\n\n\nAcme Markets implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventative maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work"

Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  \n\n\n\nAcme Markets is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Denver PA distribution center. Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of the system. \n\nAcme Markets employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at Acme Markets should be addressed to \n\nAcme Markets Environmental Affairs Department.   \n\n"
