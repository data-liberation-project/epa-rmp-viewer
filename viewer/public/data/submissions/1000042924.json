Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nOrtec, Inc. is strongly dedicated to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment to safety starts with our senior management staff and filters down throughout our entire organization. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with regulated processes at our facility.  \n\n\n\nII. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOrtec, Inc. is a custom chemical manufacturer.  Our primary business includes various adhesives, coating polymers, and similar polymers.  We presently have one regulated toxic substance present at our facility.  This substance is Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile].  The monomer is a raw material used in making our polymers.\n\n\n\nAcrylonitrile is stored in a bulk storage tank. \n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we used the EPA's RMP*Comp. \n\n\n\n\n\nIII. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined in 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA regulations.  Our facility also meets the requirements of the OSHA PSM rule.  For Acrylonitrile, a pre-startup review was conducted along with specific training by the supplier on the handling of Acrylonitrile.  All of our affected employees are trained yearly on the hazards associated with Acrylonitrile and safe handling practices.  Employees were trained on the unloading procedures for Acrylonitrile.  Only designated employees are qualified to unload Acrylonitrile monomer into the bulk storage tank.  \n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the rele"

We maintain current SDSs for all our raw materials and products.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and properly controlled.  Depending on the process, we use both the Hazard and Operability Study and Checklist methodologies to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance, safety, and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOrtec, Inc. maintains written operating procedures in order to safely conduct activities within our covered process.  The procedure for Acrylonitrile tanker unloading addresses personal protective equipment requirements, abnormal conditions, and emergency equipment/supplies requirements.  This procedure is regularly reviewed and used by the operator each time an Acrylonitrile tanker is unloaded.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nOrtec, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who handle monomers are competent in safe handling practices to protect themselves and their surroundings.  Refresher training is provided on Acrylonitrile handling at least yearly and more frequently as needed. Air monitoring is also conducted periodically during unloading operations to ensure that workers are not being overexposed.  The results are posted for all employees to review.  \n\n\n\nComprehensive training is also conducted specifically for unloading of Acrylonitrile into our bulk storage tank.  Safety procedures and alarms are reviewed during this training.\n\n\n\nAd"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others;  storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  \n\n\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Ortec, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and given training on the modification.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ortec, Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nOrtec, Inc. believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  By participation in the Ortec Safety Committee, employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including any information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.  All employees are given an overview on the incident management system, which includes incident investigation. \n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year "

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental reportable release of Acrylonitrile during this period.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nOrtec, Inc. has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  \n\n\n\nPickens County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.  Our EHS&S personnel are active members of the LEPC.  Additionally, representatives from the Easley Fire Department are invited to tour the facility yearly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIIV.   Safety Improvements\n\nTo ensure more regular training of our employees, Ortec,Inc., has increased the safety training staff.  Employees are routinely trained in chemical hazards and chemical release prevention methods.  Ortec, Inc. is also proactive in the area of process safety by conducting hazard analyses on all major processes even when not specifically required by law."
