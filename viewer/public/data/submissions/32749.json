Worth, Texas.  On site, Bunge has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance for refrigeration.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of federal Regulations (CFR) \u00a768.130.\n\nSince the quantity of ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, Bunge is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the Ft. Worth facility which includes three (3) major elements:  Hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMP Plan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by Bunge.  The required RMP information was electronically submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner before the deadline of June 21, 1999.  The RMP Plan has now been updated and Bunge has submitted its 5-year update.\n\nBunge is also subject to OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Based on the information presented in this report, Bunge is subject to Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\nBunge is committed to maintaining compliance with the requirements of RMP rule.  As such, Bunge will update this plan in the event of any of the following:\n-Within 5 years of the submission date of June 21, 2004,\n-No later than 3 years after a newly regulation substance is first listed by the U.S. EPA,\n-No later that the date on which a new regulated substance is first present in an already covered process above a threshold quantity,\n-No late than the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a new process,\n-Within 6 months of a change that requires a revised PHA or hazard review,\n-Within 6 months of a change that requires a revised offsite consequence analysis as"

Worth, Texas.  Bunge produces shortenings, oils and margarines.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for the product storage.  There is approximately 26,000 pounds of ammonia located within the closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n1.3 Worst-Case Scenario\nSection \u00a768.25 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.\n\nAt Bunge, the worst-case scenario is identified to be the release of the largest vessel containing ammonia.  The largest vessel (7,300 pounds) is assumed to instantaneously release the entire contents in a worst-case accidental release scenario.  The ammonia will then volatize into the atmosphere.  Modeling of this release was performed using a finite dispersion model based on the methods established by E. Palzazzi et. al.  This method was used because it allowed the urban topography to be accounted for.  The toxic endpoint calculated was 0.69 miles.  This release would affect residential populations.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a one inch hole in a liquid ammonia line.  This failure will assume that 1,445 pounds of ammonia will release over 11.3 minutes from the roof the facility (20 feet above ground).  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPA\u00bfs dispersion modeling software SLAB and shows that the toxic"

This release would affect the public if standing at the guard shack.\n\n1.4 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nBunge has specific process controls in place to minimize the risks of spills.  Bunge has a preventative maintenance software program, in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant\u00bfs date to day operations.  All inspection and testing procedures are contained within this program and are issued as required to the Bunge personnel for completion.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system.  These include an interlock system, alarms, and ammonia detectors located within the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n1.5 Five Year Accident History\nIn the past five years, Bunge is proud to report that there have been no accidental released of ammonia as outlined in \u00a768.42 of the RMP Regulation.\n\n1.6 The Emergency Response Program\nBunge\u00bfs emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.  These policies summarize the action to be taken in response to a chemical spill.  In the event of a spill, the HazMat Team will react with the proper actions, as listed in the Emergency Response Plan, in association with the locate fire department.\n\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nBunge makes safety a first priority in its every day operations to ensure a safe working environment for all of its employees.  Bunge is committed to continuously improving the facility\u00bfs safety and working practices through employee involvement and development.  To maximize the amount of safety and to make sure everything is in accordance with state, federal, and health and safety committee legislature, internal audits are performed periodically.  If the audit finds that there are instances where the safety standards are not followed, suggestions are made to correct the situation.  Any changes recommend"
