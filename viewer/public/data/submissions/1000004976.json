We observe all necessary safety precautions in handling anhydrous \nammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own \npersonal health and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our \npolicy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, the safety devices \ninherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the \ntraining of our personnel.\n\nThis facility complies with ANSI K-61.1 and OSHA 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous \nammonia storage.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local \nemergency response agency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage.  We receive anhydrous ammonia by \ntransport truck and store it as a liquid in pressurized vessels. Access to the process is \nrestricted to authorized employees and contractors.  The maximum amount of \nanhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this facility is 30,000 gallons (water capacity).\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of one 30,000 gallon tank when filled to its \nmaximum allowable capacity (85% @ 60 F), resulting in a release of anhydrous \nammonia.  The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 2.41 miles, based on the dense \ngas dispersion model Degadis.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and \nthere are estimated to be 863 residents, commercial/industrial areas, recreation areas, \ncemeteries, a school, hospital, and correctional facility within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is failure of a 12 foot length of 3 inch hose due to a \ncracked hose or failed fitting.  The operator observes the leak and isolates the hose by \nclosin"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and \nmaintained in accordance with ANSI K-61.1, OSHA 1910.111 and state law.\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWe maintain safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating \nparameters and equipment designs associated with our anhydrous ammonia storage \nfacilities.\n\nProcess Hazard Review\nOur Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) team conducts comprehensive \nstudies and reviews to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified \nand controlled efficiently. These activities are undertaken by a team of qualified \npersonnel with expertise in process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  \nAny findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWe maintain written operating procedures for operation of the anhydrous ammonia \nstorage facility.  These procedures address various modes of operation including initial \nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency \noperations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is readily \naccessible to operators.\n\nTraining\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are \noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these \nprocesses.
