      "SummaryText": "Our facility has one 8,000 gallon storage tank, one 12,000 gallon staorage tank and equipment for receiving ammonia from truck transports transferring ammonia from storage to nurse tanks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to storing and transferring ammonia.  Although ammonia is a toxic material, records at this facility show that we never had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.  Specific safety features that we employ to minimize damage from any unusual occurences include:  1.) Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose of line breaks.  2.)  Pressure relief valves on each tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tanks.  To futher ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained, and periodically retrained, in procedures that are in accord with current ammonia storage and transferring regulations.  In addition, we have coordinated with the Earth Volunteer Fire Department to respond to emergencies.  As required by EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA.  This scenario involves a vapor cloud release of the entire contents of the 12,000 gallon tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the impact from this scenario would eaxtend 4.18 miles from our facility.  It is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA's worst-case release scenerio will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break caused by a pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the impact from such a release would only extend 0.38 miles and would not impact any schools, hospitals, or parks."
