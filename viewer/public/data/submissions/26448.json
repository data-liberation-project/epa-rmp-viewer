Our continuing work to prevent accidents and releases from occurring, as well as our preparations to respond to accidents if they should occur, help to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This Risk Management Plan amends the Risk Management Plan for the Philadelphia Plant prepared in 1999.  The Amendment was required to reflect the revised Worst Case Scenario of the chemical compound Nitric Acid (90%).  The 1999 Risk Management Plan included a Worst Case Scenario analysis for Oleum (20%).  The use of Oleum (20%) has been discontinued at the Philadelphia Plant.  Both compounds are RMP regulated chemicals.  Rohm and Haas Company is making additional information available to the public in connection with this RMP.  This summary, prepared pursuant to 40 CFR \u00a768.115, provides an overview of the many risk management activities at the Philadelphia Plant and includes:\n\n1.0\tIntroduction\n2.0\tGeneral Facility Information\n3.0\tRegulated Substances\n4.0\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n5.0\tThe General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps  \n6.0\tFive Year Accident History\n7.0\tEmergency Response Program \n8.0\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n9.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air Act ' 112(r).  The RMP contains a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical may be subject to the RMP.

Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to the public.  This document is part of Rohm and Haas Philadelphia\u00bfs RMP communication effort.  \n\n\n2.0\tGeneral Facility Information\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Company Philadelphia Plant is a manufacturing facility located in the Bridesburg section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Rohm and Haas Philadelphia Plant manufactures specialty chemicals for industry, water treatment, and weed control.  The facility occupies 55 fenced acres bordered by Bridge Street, the Frankford Creek and the Delaware River.  Facility operations include chemical loading/unloading by truck, material storage; chemical processing, waste collection, storage and treatment; and steam generation. In all phases of its operation, the Plant stresses safety and protection of the environment.\n\nThe plant is currently composed of the following three operating areas:\n\n\u00bf\tSeparations Area - Production of ion exchange resins used in water treatment and purification, sugar refining, food and beverage processing, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\u00bf\tGOAL\u00d2 Area - Production of GOAL\u00e2 Herbicide for use on ornamental plantings, turf plantings, and tree fruit.  Goal\u00e2 is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Agrosciences Inc.\n\u00bf\tFacilities Area - Includes steam generation and waste water pre-treatment. \n\nWe are pleased to provide information on our safety and emergency preparedness plans, as well as the systems and training to prevent accidental releases.\n\n\n3.0\tRegulated Substances\n\nOur plant uses one chemical on the RMP list: \n\n\u00b7\tNitric Acid (HNO3 90%),  an RMP toxic used in the production of Goal\u00d2 herbicide. \n\nRMP calculations for Nitric Acid have been adjusted to account for the actual concentration of HNO"

For example, the plant complies with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, which is nearly identical to EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. Additionally, the Plant follows corporate and plant-specific safety standards, which in some cases are more stringent than the OSHA general safety standards.  The following items are part of our ongoing program to prevent releases and incidents:  \n\n1)\t Employee Participation \u00bf Employees are involved in many activities to continuously improve plant safety.  Employees participate in safety committees, job safety analysis, audits, design and pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analysis, training, procedure development and monthly safety meetings.\n\n2)\tProcess Hazard Analysis - Various process hazard analysis techniques are used to identify and analyze the potential hazards associated with the chemicals and processes we use. Corrective action plans are developed and implemented as part of the analyses and updated a minimum of every five years. Safety systems are designed into the processes.  These are designed to create several layers of protection, so that if one system fails other systems will maintain the process in a safe state.  Examples include:\n \n4\tRedundant safety systems and instrumentation\n4\tAutomatic shutdown devices that are triggered if critical safety equipment malfunctions\n4\tSecondary containment for storage tanks\n4\tAlarm systems and automatic shutdown devices for critical control parameters\n4\tPressure relief devices to prevent overpressurization\n4\tFire protection systems\n4\tOperator surveillance of unloading operations\n4\tPermit system to control work in hazardous areas\n4\tWork preplanning and safety reviews\n\n3)\tOperating Procedures \u00bf Operating procedures have been developed for all processes to ensure safe operation.

All plant employees are trained on the relevant aspects of the emergency response plan.  \n\n\n 8.0\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule provides detailed requirements that define a worst case scenario (WCS), namely a release of the entire contents of the largest storage vessel occurring under very stable weather conditions and at a low wind speed that results in the greatest distance to an \u00bfendpoint\u00bf  In general terms, the distance to the \u00bfendpoint\u00bf is the distance a toxic vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur.  EPA notes that the worst case scenario is designed principally to support a dialogue between the source and the community on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or primary basis for emergency planning.  Based on previous history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, the worst-case scenario is highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternate release scenario (ARS). Unlike the worst case scenario, the ARS can be limited by active mitigation safeguards, such as alarms, automatic shutdowns, and operator interventions.  According to EPA, an ARS is a more useful communication tool for the public and first responders and for emergency response preparedness and planning. \n\nThe WCS and ARS include administrative and mitigation measures which will act to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  Please refer to section 5.0 for Administrative controls.  Mitigation measures include the following:  Deluge system, remote fire monitor nozzle, containment dike system with sumps and drains, and safety interlock systems.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:  Rohm and Haas Philadelphia ha"

      "SummaryText": "s identified one WCS based on the RMP definition. \n\nRMP Defined Worst Case Scenario\n\nThis scenario involves Nitric Acid, which is considered a toxic material under the RMP rule.  It assumes the loss of the entire inventory of a 2,000 gallon (22,440 pound) storage tank inside a containment dike over a ten minute period.  This scenario takes the following passive mitigation systems into account:\nA containment dike that will contain tank contents, a bermed tankwagon loading/unloading station, and below grade sumps and drains to the chemical sewer within the dike area.\nThese passive mitigation systems would all act to reduce a spill pool area such that the vaporization rate to the atmosphere would be significantly reduced.  The PHAST dispersion model was used to determine the toxic endpoint of this release, and such a release could have a significant off-site impact.  The PHAST dispersion model has identified a toxic endpoint distance of 0.9 miles.  This release could affect the surrounding community which includes: residences, schools, recreation areas, major commercial, office, and industrial areas, and Interstate 95 depending on the weather conditions and the wind direction.  \n\nBecause of the plant controls, procedures, and training, this worst case event is considered highly unlikely.  \n\n\n Alternate Release Scenario:  Rohm and Haas Philadelphia has identified one ARS based on the RMP definition. \n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) - Nitric Acid (Toxic Liquid)\n\nRohm and Haas Philadelphia has identified one Alternate Release Scenario for Nitric Acid.  This scenario was chosen after reviewing process hazard analysis, the plant spill history, and discussing alternatives with knowledgeable and experienced unit personnel.  The scenario we have identified is more credible than that described in the worst case, but is still highly unlikely given the multiple levels of protection and extensive employee training.  The following provides a description of our alternate case sce"

      "SummaryText": "nario.\nIf a rupture occurred in the 1-1/2\u00bf transfer line from the tank truck to the storage tank, 6,300 lbs of Nitric Acid (90%) would be released outside.  The tank truck unloading operation is constantly attended by an operator per DOT regulations.  It is assumed that the release would be physically detected by the operator and stopped within 10 minutes.  The release would be contained in a sloped and diked area as the tank truck, storage tank and piping are all within a diked area.  This containment would reduce the pool area, thereby reducing the Nitric Acid vaporization rate.  The unloading area is equipped with a deluge system and a remote fire monitor nozzle to assist with mitigation. The PHAST dispersion model was used to determine the toxic endpoint.  The PHAST dispersion model has identified a toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 miles.  This release could affect plant employees, and the employees of the Frankford Arsenal to the north, depending on the weather conditions and the wind direction. There are no residences or environmental receptors within the alternate release toxic endpoint circle.  \n\n\n9.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe plant focus on safety is strong throughout the Rohm and Haas Company.  Rohm and Haas continuously looks for ways to reduce risks and to improve safety performance.  Our safety program is integrated into all parts of plant operation and involves the identification and implementation of ways to improve safety performance.  Nitric Acid will continue to be managed under the PSM and RMP regulations"
