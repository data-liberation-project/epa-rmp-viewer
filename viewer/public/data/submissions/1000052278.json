      "SummaryText": "The Milliken Longleaf facility located at 1351 Scarboro Highway, Sylvania, GA 30467 in Screven County, GA is primarily involved in the bleaching, dyeing, finishing and printing of cotton and manmade fabrics. The facility produces flame retardant fabrics on two lines (Line 54/55). These lines utilize anhydrous ammonia as part of the fabric treatment process. The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a pressurized vessel located to the west side of the facility. The vessel has a 12,000 gallon capacity for storing the anhydrous ammonia in a liquid state at a pressure of 250 psi. The ammonia is vaporized by a heating element and transferred to the process.\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), which is designed to prevent accidental releases into the environment and reduce chemical risk at a local level. The facility is also subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, which is designed to prevent the release of highly hazardous chemicals that could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace or the surrounding community.  Anhydrous ammonia is utilized in the flame resistant textile finishing process in inventories over the threshold limit of 10,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nThe RMP Program has been developed to ensure the prevention of releases to the community and the environment from the consequences of accidents involving hazardous\n\nchemicals. The RMP Program provides an overview of the RMP elements and reference material for responding to emergencies involving site specific activities at the Longleaf facility associated with the covered process under the RMP Rule.  The PSM/RMP Program at the Longleaf facility consists of 14 policies specifically associated with the program elements of the regulations. Facility personnel have been assigned responsibilities within this program.\n\n\n\nThis program will cover all process equipment related to the anhydrous ammonia system. The covered process "

The procedures include start-up, shut-down, and emergency shutdown procedures. Longleaf has not had any accidents within the past 5 years. The local emergency responders and fire department will be notified of the quantity and location of the anhydrous ammonia onsite via the annual EPCRA reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
