PP, Plymouth, WI, is a cheese production facility supplying package cheese products to private label, retail and foodservice customers around the country.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (cas #7664-41-7) is used as a refrigerant to cool facility production floors, receiving dock and warehouse and finished dock and product warehouse. Designed as a single stage, closed loop system, liquid ammonia, either pumped or high pressure, is circulated to air-cooling units. Ammonia vapor, or a combination of vapor and liquid, returns to the recirculator vessel through common suction headers. Heat laden ammonia vapor is pulled from the recirculators, compressed, and sent to rooftop condensers where heat is removed and the ammonia gas is condensed back to liquid. Liquid from the condensers gravity drains to the High Pressure/Thermosyphon Receiver. The high side operating pressure is 125 to 180 psig; low side operating pressure is 30 to 40 psig. Maximum quantity of ammonia on-site is 12,350 lbs. Since the refrigeration system contains more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Masters Galley Foods, Inc. has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nAs part of the PSM program, Masters Gallery Foods, Inc. has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Masters Gallery Foods, Inc. implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemica"

The PSM program developed and implemented at the Masters Gallery Foods facility includes the following steps:\n\n\n\nWritten plans for implementing employee participation in PSM.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process and the equipment in the process. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A PHA review of the ammonia refrigeration process was conducted to identify hazards and safeguards pertaining to the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures were developed and implemented for the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nSafe work practices were developed and implemented for lockout/tagout, confined space and opening equipment and piping. \n\n\n\nA Mechanical Integrity program is being implemented to maintain the on-going integrity and safety of the refrigeration system, including application of the following industry codes and standards: \n\n\n\nASME Boiler & Pressure Valve Codes\n\n\n\nANSI B31.3 Piping Code\n\n\n\nANSI/IIAR 2-2008 American National Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems\n\n\n\nANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15\n\n\n\nNFPA guidelines for fire protection equipment\n\n\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) program and procedures were developed to address all proposed changes to the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) procedures were developed.\n\n\n\nA detailed compliance audit checklist is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs every three years.\n\n\n\nDeveloped incident investigation procedures to analyze and review accidents or near-misses involving the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nEstablish a hot work permit sy"

An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been developed that includes coordination with local response agencies, procedures for employees to follow in the event of an accidental release of ammonia and a list of emergency phone numbers. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Masters Gallery Foods, Inc. regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety. Currently, there are no changes planned for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system."
