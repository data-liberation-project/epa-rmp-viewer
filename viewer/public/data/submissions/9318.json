THIS INCLUDES A SAFETY PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN. THIS IS TO INSURE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE WELL INFORMED AND EDUCATED ABOUT PLANT SAFETY AND ACCIDENTAL RELEASES.\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE SEWER TREATMENT PLANT IS TO REMOVE SOLIDS FROM THE WASTEWATER AND PROVIDE DISINFECTION PRIOR TO DISCHARGING THE TREATED WATER INTO A RECIEVING STREAM. DISINFECTION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY ADDING CHLORINE TO THE WATER. THE CHLORINE GAS IS STORED IN ONE TON CYLINDERS IN AN OUTSIDE AREA COVERED BY A ROOF. THERE ARE A TOTAL OF FIVE CYLINDERS AMOUNTING TO 10,000 POUNDS OF CHLORINE ON SITE. ONLY TWO CYLINDERS ARE ACTIVE AT ANY GIVEN TIME, AMOUNTING TO 4,000 POUNDS.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A RELEASE FROM THE TWO ACTIVE CYLINDERS DUE TO A CHLORINATOR OR MANIFOLD FAILURE. THIS IS UNLIKELY BECAUSE THE CHORINE SYSTEM IS INSPECTED DAILY, AND ANY INDICATION OF A POSSIBLE RELEASE WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY BE REMEDIED.IN THE EVENT OF A RELEASE, THE OPERATOR ON DUTY WOULD NOTIFY THE CROSBY FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE HARRIS COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, AND THE EMERGENCY CONTACT SPECIFIED IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN. RESIDENTS, SCHOOLS, ETC. WOULD BE NOTIFIED AND EVACUATED IF NEEDED. THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETURN WHEN THE ALL CLEAR SIGNAL IS GIVEN.\n\nTHERE HAS NOT BEEN A CHLORINE GAS RELEASE AT THE SEWER PLANT WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nPERSONNEL ATTEND PERIODIC SAFETY MEETINGS, SAFETY SCHOOLS, CHLORINE SCHOOLS, AND PARTICIPATE IN DRILLS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND MINIMIZE THE DURATION OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE."
