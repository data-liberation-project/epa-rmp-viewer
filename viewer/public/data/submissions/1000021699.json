The wastewater facility was designed to process an Average Dry Weather Flow of 2.3 MGD and a maximum hydraulic capacity through the primary system of 5.0 MGD.  Wastewater treatment is accomplished through solids removal, primary and secondary  treatment (oxidation ponds/treatment marshes/enhancement marshes).  Secondarily treated wastewater effluent is disinfected using chlorine and dechlorinated using sulfur dioxide prior to discharge to Outfall 001- Humboldt Bay and Outfall 002 - Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility has been handling chlorine for over 25 years and has never experienced a release.  On average, there are 15 (1 ton) chlorine containing cylinders on site.  Typically six (6) cylinders are on-line and nine (9) are in storage.  There are also six (6) sulfur dioxide containing cylinders, with two (2) cylinders on-line and four (4) in storage.  Following a chemical demand evaluation, staff determined that due to an annual average chlorine consumption of 1.5 - 2.0 tons per week,  chemical supplier location  (500 miles), delivery delays due to road conditions and effluent disinfection requirements (public health and off-shore commercial shellfish harvesting) the amount of on-site chemical is necessary.     \n\nDisinfection is accomplished through treated wastewater being inducted with chlorine gas and detained in the chlorine contact basin.  Following detention, sulfur dioxide is inducted into the chlorinated wastewater for dechlorination and the effluent is discharged to Outfall 001 (Humboldt Bay) and Outfall 002 (Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary).\n\nThe vaccum operated induction units contain sensors that provide notification upon high vaccum, low vaccum and/or power failure status sensors an"

As additional backup, there is on-site automatic audible alarm that alerts employees within the Corporation Yard of a gas leak or release and a manually activated audible alarm to instruct employees and visitors to evacuate the premises. All alarms have uninterupted power supplies installed.  Equipment inspections are regularly conducted and recorded by operational staff.\n\nIn the event of a leak or release, chlorine response trained employees will don SCBA suits prior to entering the staging area.  Four (4) SCBA suits are stored in the Plant Operations Building, and two (2) SCBA suits are stored at location .5 mile north of the treatment plant.  Prior to engaging in response activities the Arcata Fire Department will be notified for backup, and a minimum of four employees must be present prior to entering the area.
