Due to wastewater effluent characteristics, NPDES permit requirements and financial costs for system design, modification and operations, disinfection utilizing chlorine was deemed the most viable.

The wastewater facility was designed to process an Average Dry Weather Flow of 2.3 MGD and a maximum hydraulic capacity through the primary system of 5.0 MGD.  Wastewater treatment is accomplished through solids removal, primary and secondary  treatment (oxidation ponds/treatment marshes/enhancement marshes).  Secondarily treated wastewater effluent is disinfected using chlorine and dechlorinated using sulfur dioxide prior to discharge to Outfall 001- Humboldt Bay and Outfall 002 - Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility has been handling chlorine for over 25 years and has never experienced a release.  On average, there are 15 (1 ton) chlorine containing cylinders on site.  Typically six (6) cylinders are on-line and nine (9) are in storage.  There are also six (6) sulfur dioxide containing cylinders, with two (2) cylinders on-line and four (4) in storage.  Following a chemical demand evaluation, staff determined that due to an annual average chlorine consumption of 1.5 - 2.0 tons per week,  chemical supplier location  (500 miles), delivery delays due to road conditions and effluent disinfection requirements (public health and off-shore commercial shellfish harvesting) the amount of on-site chemical is necessary.     \n\nDisinfection is accomplished through treated wastewater being inducted with chlorine gas and detained in the chlorine contact basin.  Following detention, sulfur dioxide is inducted into the chlorinated wastewater for dechlorination and the effluent is discharged to Outfall 001 (Humboldt Bay) and Outfall 002 (Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary).\n\nThe vaccum operated induction units contain sensors that provide notification upon high vaccum, low vaccum and/or power failure status sensors an"
