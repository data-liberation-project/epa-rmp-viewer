      "SummaryText": "POLICY STATEMENT- It is Jefferson County ESD's policy to perate safe wastewater treatment plants, reducing to the greates extent possible any hazards associated with the necessary treatment processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel and environment. The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effectice contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Five Mile Creek WWTP. It is ESD's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws applicable to the Five Mile Creek WWTP. DESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED- The Five Mile Creek WWTP is a publically owned and operated wastewater treatment plant. Chlorine is used primarily for disinfection. Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in settling biosolids in the clarification process. The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored at the facility is 8,000 pounds (4- one ton cylinders). The chlorination system consists of vacuum regulators, evaporator, automatic switchover system, chlorine gas dispensers, chlorine leak detectors, alarms, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment. Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorinating the effluent before it is discharged into Five Mile Creek. However, the sulfur dioxide storage quantity is less than the Risk Management Program (RMP) applicability threshold of 5,000 pounds. Engineered controls include vacuum regulators, sulfur dioxide leak detectors, alarms, and associated piping are present on the sulfur dioxide system to minimize the risk of an accidental release. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS- The Five Mile Creek WWTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68. The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative,"

      "SummaryText": "technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule. A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a \"What-If\" analysis. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY- In the past five years, the Five Mile Creek WWTP has not had a release of chlorine resulting in injuries, deaths, property or environment damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. Also, there were no accidents involving chlorine in the 5-year period prior to the submittal of the 1999 RMP. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM- The Jefferson County ESD has an emergency response plan for the Five Mile Creek WWTP, which coordinates response efforts with the Fultondale Fire Department, the police department, and the hospital. Response activities also have been coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY- It was observed during the hazard review that the Five Mile Creek WWTP has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorinations system."
