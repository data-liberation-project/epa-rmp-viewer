This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. The objective of risk management is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, the Chemical Plant's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing a set of structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS). In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against an international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to the requirements of ISO 14001. After an extensive review, which included a number of audits of various ExxonMobil Corporation facilities, Lloyd's concluded that the \"environmental components of the OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the\r\nrequirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard.\" They went on to say, \"We further believe ExxonMobil Corporation to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Chemical Plant, located in Baytown, Texas, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce a variety of petrochemical products such as Butyl Rubber, polypropylene plastic, and a number of chemical intermediate feedstocks. Several regulated flammable substances and flammable mixtures and toxic substances are contained"

EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP).  Some processes at the Chemical Plant are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe hazard assessments were done using EPA's RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  This Guidance covers all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both Worst Case (WCS) and Alternate Release (ARS) scenarios.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chemical Plant. This section addresses the following elements:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training,\r\nContractors, Pre-startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Changes, Incident Investigation and Compliance Audits.  The accident prevention program at the Chemical Plant equally covers all individually listed regulated substances, flammable mixtures, and toxic substances.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to information created as part of the Chemical Plant accident prevention program, which is documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Chemical Plant. In addition, the Chemical Plant has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives"

The teams typically have members from various areas of the Chemical Plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and Chemical Plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Plant keeps a variety of documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific groups within the Chemical Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the Chemical Plant has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions. The Chemical Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these safe limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems).\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Plant also maintains numerous documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. These documents include information such as materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Chemical Plant primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique.  These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated. The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards on the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Mitigation options are identified and evaluated.  Selected mitigation options are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution and completion of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the process controls are consistent with design safety features, the Chemical Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews, hazard reviews are also performed during the design stage of new facilities and for facilities undergoing significant modification.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Chemical Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as;\r\n(1)\tinitial startup;\r\n(2)\tnormal operations;\r\n(3)\ttemporary operations;\r\n(4)\temergency shutdown;\r\n(5) \temergency operations;\r\n(6)\tnormal shutdown; and,\r\n(7) \tstart-up following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown."

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chemical Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in Chemical Plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstrations) they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operations technicians periodically receive refresher training on key operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted monthly. Each key procedure is refreshed at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nTraining is also provided for each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Chemical Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved. The resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all affected employees (including contractors). Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Chemical Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Chemical Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Chemical Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized above is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Chemical Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error. \r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Chemical Plant has safety features on many processes to:\r\n(1)\tquickly detect a release;\r\n(2) \tcontain/control a release; and,\r\n(3)\treduce the consequences (mitigate) of a release.\r\n\r\nThe following types"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the Chemical Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Chemical Plant processes or other Chemical Plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Chemical Plant is coordinated with the Baytown Area Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Chemical Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the City of Baytown Fire Department. The Chemical Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., City of Baytown Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. The Chemical Plant also uses the Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Line to provide messages to the community during an emergency.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Operations Integrity Management System forms the cornerstone for continuous improvement in the Chemical Plant's safety-related systems. These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement"
