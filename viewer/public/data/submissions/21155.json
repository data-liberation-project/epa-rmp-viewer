      "SummaryText": "This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Cargill Foods, Turkey Products is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Managment Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR 68, to deal with risk involved with storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These pograms enable our facility to prevent the occurence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our EHS Programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals incluing any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemiclas, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and seperate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. Our EHS programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detaled and improved as necessary. They are also commnicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility. Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at Cargill Foods, Turkey Products. Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process rather than a chemical process. Ammonia , the refrigerant is used as a heat ransfer media to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of four processes: evaporation, condensation, compression, and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigera"

      "SummaryText": "nt. Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy.  The ammonia refrigeration cycle is in a closed system uitilizing fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat vaporization for cooling. To evaporate liquid ammonia to a vapor latent heat of vaporization must be applied to the liquid. Cargill Foods, Turkey Products utilizes the ammonia refrigeration system for keeping plant processing areas at a constant temperaure, perserving product, chilling water, and making ice. For worst case release scenario purposes, Cargill Foods, Turkey Products chose a failure of the high pressure receiver containing 47,957 lbs. of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 80 % of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 2.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst case weather conditons are uncommon; the vessel is located in a restricted area of the facility; the vessel has guards in-place to protect it from impact; industry standardsfor the manufacture and quantity control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in the vessel; the accident prevention program is in place at Plantation Foods including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; alarms in place to operating personel of process upsets; and the emergency reponse plan and equipment in place at Cargill Foods. For alternate case release scenario purposes, Cargill Foods, Turkey Products, chose the failure of transfer hose during unloading resulting in a release of 71 pounds of ammonia over a time period of one minute. Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.11 miles before dispersing enough o no longer pose a hazard to the public. T"

      "SummaryText": "ransfer hose failure was chosen as the alternative release scenario because it is scenario because it is a temporary connection and constructed of materials other than steel. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: emergency equipment  such as an excess flow valve on the tank truck and valves to isolate the transfer hose, Cargill Foods, Turkey Products, acident prevention program is in place including operating procedures to have personnel present at all times during unloading, and the mechanical intergrity program for regular maintenance, inspecting, and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; and the emergency response plan and equipment is in place at Cargil Foods, Turkey Products. Since Cargill Foods, Turkey Products exceeds the threshold quantity for ammonia, we will comply with a Program 3 prevention program. This will help to provide a safer environment for employees and the community, plus make the refrigeration system more efficient. All elements of the prevention program have been implemented. Cargill Foods, Turkey Products has not experienced any accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years. Cargill Foods, Turkey Products' emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency repsonse and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Waco Fire Department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and fire department."
