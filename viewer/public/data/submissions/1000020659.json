The facility is equipped with a refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S. #7664-41-7.  Ammonia is the sole regulated substance with regard to the aforementioned regulations.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded. Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has experienced no releases in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Action Plan\n\nAll employees are trained in the emergency action plan annually.  Employees are trained to act based on their pre-assigned roles during emergency situations.  The facility is part of the Dickson County LEPC and emergencies are responded to by the local hazmat authorities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nOngoing training of operators, inspection and testing of equipment and preventative maintenance of deteriorated system components are being implemented to improve safety."
