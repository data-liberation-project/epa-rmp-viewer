As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Ingleside Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Ingleside Plant.\nThe RMP at the Ingleside Plant consists of the following three elements:\n7 A hazard assessment program to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances)\n7 A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a\nregulated substance (covered processes)\n7 An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\nAlthough the risk management program at the Ingleside Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety and environmental program at the Ingleside Plant.  In fact, the Ingleside Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against releases of hazardous substances as well as injuries and damage from such releases.\nOxyChem's policy on the use of hazardous substances:  Before using a hazardous substance at the"

When a hazardous substance is used at the Ingleside Plant, OxyChem reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC), also referred to as the Technical/Engineering Assistance Request (TEAR) program, and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\nOxyChem strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility:  OxyChem implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used or produced at the Ingleside Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.\nOxyChem also uses the Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, OxyChem requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. OxyChem's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\nOxyChem's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release.  In the event of an accidental release, the Ingleside Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment.  OxyChem utilizes emergency response plans as required by government re"

These first reponders are trained to respond to emergencies such as chemical releases, fires, explosions, etc.  The HAZMAT Team is also backed up by the Refinery Terminal Fire Company (RTFC) located in Corpus Christi.  The facility also maintains an active Chemical Emergency Response Team (CERT) which is on call 24 hours a day to\nrespond to an off-site chemical emergencies.  Both of these teams are trained and equipped to respond to chemical emergencies involving Ingleside's products, raw materials, and intermediates.  OxyChem also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office to assistant in all emergencies. In addition, OxyChem works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) of San Patricio County to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if an event does occur.\nIngleside Plant's emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, and EPA regulations.\nThis plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Ingleside Plant.  If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities, the Emergency Management Plan is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency.  A Special Situations Plan (SSP) has also been developed to assist the surrounding communities in the event a major chemical emergency from the Ingleside Plant would affect them.\nOxyChem is an active participant in the community:  OxyChem is an active participant in plant and community programs which promote education, safety, and environmental awareness.

Safety is a primary concern in our facility and is demonstrated by our selection by OSHA in September 1991 as a STAR facility in the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).  The Ingleside Plant STAR has been recertified twice with the most recent being granted in August 1998.\nOxyChem is an industry leader in the implementation of the Chemical Manufacturer's Association sponsored Responsible Care(r) Initiative. As part of OxyChem's Responsible Care(r) efforts, the Ingleside Plant has voluntarily been involved in a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) since 1991. The purpose of this group is to share information about  plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The group meets periodically and covers topics of interest to the members including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, health issues and process safety performance.
