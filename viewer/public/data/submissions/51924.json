      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nClearwater International LLC (Clearwater) owns and operates a batch specialty chemicals manufacturing plant in Elmendorf, Texas.  This plant was constructed by Alpha Intermediates, Inc. in the early 1980s and has operated continuously at the Elmendorf location since that time.  T-101, a new tank, was added to store formalin, a mixture of formaldehyde (37%), methanol, and water.  The formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of various products.\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to Clearwater because the plant now handles and stores formaldehyde in excess of threshold quantities.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n(1)  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause, \u00a7112(r)(1), is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Clearwater is committed to ensuring the safe operation of its Elmendorf plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  Clearwater, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the plant and for the community by communicating with the Bexar County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n(2)  Risk Management Plan - The batch specialty chemicals manufacturing plant involves the handling and storage of one chemical in excess of the threshold specified in \u00a7112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of \u00a7112(r), Clearwater management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of formaldehyde.  Programs have been established to prevent accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release, including maintaining a trained Integrated Preven"

To date, no accidents with offsite impacts have occurred at these facilities.\n\nIn addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, Clearwater is in compliance with the OSHA PSM, EPA SPCC, OSHA HAZWOPER, EPCRA, and EPA RCRA Contingency Planning requirements.  Clearwater has also conducted a process hazard analysis on processes that use formaldehyde processes, herein referred to as formalin or formaldehyde storage and processing or simply as the formaldehyde process.\n\nFor planning purposes, Clearwater has considered the impact of a potential \u00bfworst case\u00bf accident involving the RMP-covered chemical \u00bf formaldehyde in solution (as formalin), a toxic liquid.  This worst case scenario is defined as follows:\n\n    Formalin (37% Formaldehyde) Storage & Processing \u00bf Assumes the entire contents of the formalin in storage tank T-101 (110,000 pounds) are released in 10 minutes reaching a potential impact distance of 0.4 miles in any direction.  Since formalin is 37% formaldehyde, this would result in a release of 40,700 pounds of formaldehyde. The dike around the storage tanks was considered as passive mitigation, since the liquid would be released into the diked area limiting the surface area for evaporation, and thus limiting the impact to people and the environment.  This worst-case release would reach offsite receptors. It should be emphasized that the probability of the worst-case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote \u00bf far less than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury.\n\nClearwater also considered the impact of more likely releases.  An alternative release analysis was performed for the formaldehyde process as follows: \n\n    Formalin (37% Formaldehyde) Storage & Processing \u00bf An accidental and unmitigated liquid release of formalin (37% formaldehyde) from a broken transfer hose during unloading at 4,000 gal/hr and s"

The release is estimated to occur over a period of two minutes based on the assumption that the release would be noticed immediately since the unloading is a manned operation. Using EPA Risk Management Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (EPA 550-B-99-009, April 1999), the impact distance of this release was calculated to be 0.1 miles, which could potentially have offsite impacts. \n\nClearwater has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  Clearwater has active operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures; a trained IPC Plan Implementation Team; and an evacuation plan for each area.  In addition, Clearwater has communicated site-specific chemical hazard information to the LEPC and to the local volunteer fire department (Sandy Oaks Volunteer Fire Department).\n\nClearwater\u00bfs management is committed to the following:\n\n\u00b7 Preventing accidents;\n\u00b7 Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\u00b7 Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\u00b7 Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Clearwater operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\u00b7 Being a good corporate citizen of Bexar County.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about Clearwater\u00bfs management of the risks associated with operating the batch specialty chemicals manufacturing plant.  Most important, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."
