The training facility, which is housed in a renovated old production building, provides employees the opportunity to train in a plant environment on safety procedures such as hot work, line breaking, confined space entry, and lockout-tag out.\n\n\n\nMultiple layers of protection are developed and put in place on all processes to prevent accidental releases. Equipment is expertly designed according to strict engineering standards. Safety reviews are conducted on new and modified processes and equipment during design and before start-up. A maintenance and inspection program is conducted and documented to ensure facility soundness.\n\n\n\nLubrizol's ongoing process safety program includes a measurement of performance, audits and implementation of corrective actions. This continuous management of the system assures that safety is always the top priority.\n\n\n\nIf an emergency were to occur, we have a trained and certified emergency response organization staffed 24 hours a day to immediately react and mitigate the emergency. In addition, if we need additional assistance we have an established working relationship and direct communication with the local Lake County Fire Departments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\n \n\nLubrizol Painesville is a specialty manufacturing facility.
