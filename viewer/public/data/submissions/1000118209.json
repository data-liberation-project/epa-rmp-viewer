This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at the CTI Foods facility in Wilder, Idaho.\n\nIt is the policy of CTI Foods to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  CTI Foods maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The policy is reviewed and updated as needed to ensure it remains an accurate reflection of the facility\u0092s policies regarding evacuation and the protocol to deal with emergency scenarios.\n\nCTI Foods coordinates emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operations and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of CTI Foods to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The CTI Foods Maintenance Manager as well as the ammonia refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the plant\u0092s safety program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), and EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident"

It is located at 22303 US Highway 95, just north of Wilder, Idaho.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the CTI Foods facility has a maximum intended inventory of ~83,000 pounds of ammonia.  It is a closed-loop system with no planned emissions or releases of ammonia.  Ammonia is used as the primary refrigerant, which means it is used as a vehicle to remove heat from the various refrigeration applications including product freezers, cold storage evaporators, and chiller heat exchangers.\n\nThere is one mechanical equipment room that includes both \u0093East Compressor Room\u0094, and \u0093West Compressor Room\u0094 (partially divided by a wall).  It houses refrigeration equipment, including ammonia compressors, pumps, and pressure vessels.  Various recirculator packages, chillers, heat exchangers, and evaporators + freezers are also located throughout the plant.  The Condensers are located outside on the facility roof.\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously on demand.  The compressors and condensers cycle on and off to address system heat loads during operation.\n\nWhen heat is absorbed by the liquid refrigerant (ammonia), it vaporizes (changes phase), and is then compressed by the compressors.  The resulting high pressure ammonia vapor is routed to the condensers, where fans and sprayed water are used to reject latent heat in the ammonia vapor, causing it to condense to a liquid.\n\nMultiple pump recirculator packages at different temperatures / pressures are utilized for the various refrigeration applications at the facility th"

To help coordinate the various elements of the program, a management system has been established that defines responsible parties for the facility to ensure upkeep and implementation of each policy within the RMP and PSM programs.  Compliance Audits are also conducted every 3 years that can identify potential gaps in compliance and recommend actions to achieve full compliance.\n\nSeveral departments within the facility (Refrigeration, Maintenance, and Safety) as well as outside resources (Ammonia Refrigeration Contractor, and a Risk Management Consultant) help to ensure the appropriate and ongoing implementation (with recordkeeping) of the various elements of the programs.

These programs enable our facility to operate the refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the broader ammonia refrigeration industry throughout the country.  In the event of an ammonia release, the emergency response plan is coordinated with the City of Wilder Fire Department, as well as the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system and the associated safety features were designed in accordance with contemporary codes and standards.  The RMP responsible personnel (with guidance from contractors and consultants) also routinely review Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP) for the ammonia refrigeration industry to ensure that the facility is properly maintained, and appropriate adjustments are made based on evolving industry standards.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEPA\u0092s RMP regulation defines \u0093accident\u0094 as the following: \n\n\u0093The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.
