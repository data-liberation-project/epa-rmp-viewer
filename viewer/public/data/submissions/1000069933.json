Operating in a safe and environmentally protective manner are values held above all others.  Pasadena Plastics Complex is focused on preventing serious process-related incidents that might affect plant personnel, visitors, the community or the environment.  The process safety management (PSM) program demonstrates this focused commitment.  The PSM program involves the application of management systems and performance management practices to control process hazards through objectives, programs, procedures, audits, evaluations, and training that considers safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  \r\n\r\nContinuous improvement in safety and environmental performance will be achieved, among other things, through the company's Employee Safety Process, Tenets of Operation guiding principles and S.A.F.E (Safety Awareness For Everyone) program.    Planned changes to improve safety at the Pasadena Plastics Complex are reviewed and adjusted annually. They are also included in the yearly budgets; and incorporated into the performance management systems / practice throughout the organization.  These planned changes include, but are not limited to safety related capital projects, safety programs / initiatives, procedure improvements, and SOP validations.   \r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the management systems and performance management practices used at the Pasadena Plastics Complex and are measured using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Investigations will be conducted with the objective of determining the causes and prevention of future incidents.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge that is gained from accident/incident reports, maintenance records, case histories, and trend analysis of incidents will provide basic information and potential changes that can be used to help further prevent catastrophic events.  As a tool to help manage this knowledge, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company has implemented a Knowledge Management System (KMS).

Graphics contain executables to streamline emergency response.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nPasadena Plastics Complex has implemented a comprehensive training program for Pasadena Plastics Complex employees especially those involved in operating a process.  Operator Training has been developed to equip operators with the knowledge and skill necessary to safely and proficiently perform their job duties.  This training emphasizes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.  Written tests, oral tests, observation, demonstration and peer evaluations are utilized to verify the training.\r\n\r\nRefresher training/certification is provided every three years to operations personnel on the operating units for which they are responsible.  Training in safe work practices is given to employees during new employee safety orientation, annual safety training, special classes and monthly safety meetings.  \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nContract employees at Pasadena Plastics Complex provide labor for general maintenance or repairs, turnarounds, major renovations, construction, demolition, equipment installation or specialty work on or adjacent to covered processes.

The contractor employer is responsible for assuring that each contract employee is trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job.  On site contractors (nested and non-nested) are observed and audited for their knowledge and adherence to our safe work practices. PPC hosts a monthly  Contractor Safety Network (CSN) meeting for the contractors at the site to present safety hot topics, safety related KPIs, and incident lessons learning. This meeting is in addition to the required contractor group safety meetings. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe intent of the mechanical integrity program is to provide a management system that ensures:  (1) the equipment is maintained in a manner to prevent or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical and (2) the equipment is maintained by trained and qualified personnel to assure its continued integrity.  The Mechanical Integrity Covered Equipment (MICE) at Pasadena Plastics Complex includes the following type of equipment: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping, valves, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  The basic aspects of the mechanical integrity system include:  (1) design and construction requirements; (2) preventive maintenance practices; (3) testing and inspection; (4) repair, modification and alteration procedures; and (5) inspector and craftsman training and qualifications.  \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nPasadena Plastics Complex has many safe work practices that promote worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) hot work permits to control work involving flame or spark-producing operations; (2) confined space entry permits to ensure adequate safety precautions ha"

These procedures, along with others, form a system to help make certain that operations and maintenance activities are performed in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n\r\nPasadena Plastics Complex has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  Changes may introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards incorporated in the original design of the process and must be reviewed prior to their implementation.   This system requires that change to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), software, procedures (including operating, maintenance, and safe work) and emergency procedures be properly reviewed for potential hazards and authorized using the MOC/PSR Certification form and an electronic approval process before being implemented.  This system requires that any change executed address the following: the technical basis for the proposed change; the impact of the change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  \r\n\r\nAffected process safety information (e.g., mechanical, electrical/instrument, chemical, and operating limits) and procedures (e.g., operating, maintenance, and safe work) are updated to incorporate these changes.

The PSR serves as a final check prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals into the process at a new facility and conducted prior to start-up, commissioning, or engagement of the change, for existing, modified facilities.  The PSSR must confirm the following: a PHA has been performed for new facilities and that PHA recommendations have been resolved; MOC requirements have been executed for changes to modified facilities; construction and equipment installation is in accordance with design specifications; training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed; and, safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nIncidents, which resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical, are investigated by a cross-section of plant personnel.

The review identifies important trends, global lessons learned and potential safety issues that need additional attention. The results of these reviews are shared with employees through the Sequential Safety Meeting process as part of the Employee Safety Process.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nPasadena Plastics Complex conducts compliance audits to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the PSM Program at Pasadena Plastics Complex; to ensure that each program element complies with the standard; and to ascertain whether the programs' internal procedures and practices are adequate and are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team is comprised of trained auditors including the company audit team (from headquarters) and Subject Matter Experts from other facilities within the company.  The auditors use a defined protocol and checklists based on the OSHA PSM standard.  Audit findings and responses are entered and maintained in a corporate computer-based tracking system.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe processes at Pasadena Plastics Complex have hazards that must be managed to help ensure continued safe operation.
