      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nBunge OVC is a major manufacturer of private label margarine and vegetable oil based spreads. The Company was formed in the mid 1950's and was originally located in South Richmond. A new manufacturing facility was built at its current location in Sandston, Virginia in 1983. Bunge North America purchased the Dean Foods Company in August 2011 and employs approximately 145 people and operates three shifts. \r\n\r\nIn order to produce its product, and in order to preserve it for safe delivery to the consumer, a refrigeration system is necessary. The refrigeration system at Bunge OVC uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant of choice.\r\n\r\nThe Bunge OVC facility is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulations CFR Part 1910.119 for the storage of more than 10,000 pounds of compressed anhydrous ammonia, an acutely hazardous material (AHM), in a closed loop refrigeration system.  The PSM manual is maintained by the Plant Manager, Safety and Environmental Manager, and by the Maintenance Manager.  The facility is also required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) plan.\r\n \r\nThe Risk Management Program is contained in part 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The program is intended to prevent, detect and respond to accidental release of highly hazardous materials.  The program was finalized on June 20, 1996, and RMPs are required of all facilities exceeding threshold quantities of highly hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nThe various elements of the Process Safety Management Program - including general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific release prevention and emergency response procedures - are in force at Bunge and form the core of the accidental release and emergency response efforts at the facility. Compliance with the Process Safety Management Program is Company policy.  In addition, the facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan.  It is attached in the Appendices.\r\n\r\nFollowing the guidelines set forth under the EPA Chemic"

      "SummaryText": "al Accident Prevention Regulations (i.e. 40 CFR PART 68) the Worst Case Scenario was identified as a catastrophic failure of the outside ammonia receiver tank such as could occur due to impact from a de-railed tank car. Worst Case Scenario modeling was performed using \"RMP Comp\".\r\n \r\nAdditionally, a more likely alternate scenario was investigated. This release assumes that a forklift breaks a liquid ammonia supply line to an evaporator in a refrigerated storage warehouse. The largest impact would be on the facility itself as the building would trap much of the ammonia inside thereby providing passive mitigation. The Alternate Release Scenario was also performed using \"RMP Comp.\"\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable ammonia refrigeration process related accidents within the past five years at this facility.  The facility has an Emergency Action Plan in place and has coordinated it with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The facility also has an Ammonia Release Reporting Guideline.\r\n\r\nBunge North America has a continuing commitment to process safety. In December 2013, the Company conducted a self audit of our PSM Program, including a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), and implemented several improvements as a result."
