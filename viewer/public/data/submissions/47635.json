      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\nThe Coors Brewing Company (CBC) operates a beer blending, finishing and packaging facility near Elkton, Virginia (CBC Shenandoah facility).  The facility uses anhydrous ammonia as the chemical in the two, (2) on site refrigeration processes.  Use of this chemical is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management (RM) Planning regulations (40 CFR, Part 68) herein referred to as the RM regulations.  Under the CAAA and the RM regulations, the facility is considered to be one stationary source, with two processes.  \n\nThis document addresses the five EPA regulatory requirements for an RM Plan which form the basis of the RM program for the Shenandoah facility.  EPA's key regulatory requirements for an RM program are:\n\n1) Management Plan\n2) Hazard Assessment\n3) Accident History\n4) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n5) Emergency Response\n6) Risk Management (RM) Plan and Data Elements\n\nThis RM plan is based on the requirements listed above and is organized to reflect them as summarized below:\n\nRequirement 1.  Management Plan\nThe RM Program Manager for CBC Shenandoah facility is the Environmental Engineer who reports to the EHS & Security Manager, who in turn, reports to the Vice President, Plant Manager.   At the Shenanodah Brewery, the EH&S Manager, Security, and the Environmental Engineer are responsible for the accidental release prevention program for the ammonia refrigeration processes.  Utilities supervisors, maintenance supervisors, operators, engineers, and staff level personnel also execute component activities to maintain compliance with RM regulations.  At Shenandoah, individuals have been assigned responsibility for all regulatory requirements of the RM program.\n\nRequirement 2.  Hazard Assessment\nPotential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia were modeled to evaluate possible offsite impacts. Modeling procedu"

      "SummaryText": "res followed EPA guidance to identify worst case (WCS) and alternate case release scenarios (ACS) as defined by the RM regulations.  EPA personnel concur that assumptions used for WCS are not realistic and in some cases are not physically possible.  However, EPA guidance was followed and endpoints were identified.  The WCS?s were identified by comparing the results for each process and selecting the scenario that resulted in the greatest distance to the endpoint.  \nTo develop more realistic, although conservative, estimates of offsite impacts, as required by RM regulations, several ACS?s were also evaluated for the ammonia systems.   For each scenario the number of permanent offsite residents located inside a circle (centered on the release point with a radius equal to the endpoint) was estimated using EPA's LandView 6 software. This software is an approved EPA source of population data. The offsite population estimates reflected in the RMP do not include the CBC employees at the Shenandoah facility.  As stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25, the WCS?S and ACS?s were calculated for the Shenandoah covered processes and the results of those calculations are held on file at the CBC Shenandoah facility. \n\nRequirement 3.  Accident History\nIn the past five years, there have been no releases that have resulted in offsite property damage or offsite health consequences requiring medical treatment for chemical releases or fire.\n\nRequirement 4.  Prevention Program\nThe prevention program for the (2) ammonia processes were developed to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29CFR 1910.119). The 12 key provisions of the release prevention program for the ammonia process for which EPA requires Program 3 prevention programs to have, are as follows:\n\n- Employee Participation\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Contractors\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Training"

      "SummaryText": "\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Management of Change\n- Incident Investigation\n- Compliance Audits\n\nRequirement 5.  Emergency Response \nThe emergency response program at the facility consists of personnel trained to recognize releases and immediately notify Coors Security by telephone.  Security sends a trained incident commander to the scene to assess the situation and engage the proper internal and external emergency response personnel and equipment.  When external emergency responders are needed, a joint command is then established which is led by the Authority Having Jurisdiction, (AHJ) and supported by CBC Security and CBC personnel.  The AHJ will initially be the McGaheysville Fire Department.  The AHJ can call additional external emergency response resources to the scene that would include the Rockingham County Hazmat Team, Virginia State Police and other agencies, as needed.  \n\nThe security officers responsible for emergency response are Berry Brent, Todd Dyer, Ronnie Hensley, Steven Jarrell, Robert Michael, Sandra Stickley, and Keven Whitfield.  The security office is manned 24 hours a day by telephone (540-289-8173).\n\n \nRequirement 6.  RM Plan and Data Elements\nThe specific data elements required to be electronically reported to EPA are included in this submittal.  The data elements are supported by an RM plan on file at the Shenandoah facility which documents and provides additional detail for the RM regulatory requirement."
