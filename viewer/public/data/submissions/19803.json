If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility information\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 149,000 lbs in an 30,000 gal tank.\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\na) The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 30,000 gal tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 149,000 lbs, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\nb) The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history(or most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .1 miles.\n4. The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n5. The Five-year Accident History\na) There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n6.  The emergency response program\n- The facility has:\na) provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\nb) a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standar"
