      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe AES Mendota, L.P. facility handles anhydrous ammonia which is considered a hazardous material.  The properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility?s workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility?s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is a 28 megawatt (MW), biomass-fired, electrical power generating facility.  The plant burns agricultural, wood fuels, and other crop wastes in a fluidized bed boiler to generate high pressure steam which drives a turbine generator.  Ammonia vapor is used at the plant to control nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions in the boiler flue gas.  Anhydrous ammonia is received at the plant via a supplier's delivery vehicle and stored in a single 20,000 gallon capacity tank.  There is a daily maximum of 88,000 lbs of ammonia at the facility.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe largest and only storage vessel is a 20,000 gallon pressurized bulk tank of ammonia.  Failure of this container will release 88,000 lbs of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire 88,000 lbs is released as gas in ten minutes.  The ammonia storage tank is located outside of any structure or building.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14mg/L (200ppm) for the Worst Case scenario will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for the covered process was determined to be the result of an undetected hole in the temporarily connected liquid filling hose from the delivery vehicle to the ammo"

The estimated duration of this event is ten minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14mg/L (200ppm) for the Alternative Release scenario will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia system and the training provided to the ammonia system operators.\n\n3d. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing,  and maintenance of the ammonia system and its related equipment and components. \n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility?s main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases occurred within the last five years\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the local Fire Department and other agency emergency response teams at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be init"

Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nCommitments made under the State of California?s Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program and  related activities will continue to be implemented.  Current applicable codes and regulations are  reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the ammonia system."
