The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. The review provides an additional check to ensure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity \nBOP has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) training, (2) written procedures, (3) inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nSafe Work Practices \nBOP has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  These include control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, energy isolation for equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work permit/procedure, vehicle entry into process area, confined space entry permit/procedure, and job safety analyses.  \n\nManagement of Change \nBOP has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and amended as necessary. \n\nBOP has identified operating limits (i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.) This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\nBOP has implemented a comprehensive training program.

These documents include information such as materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \nBOP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that controls are in place to manage these hazards.  New projects that add facilities are analyzed as part of the design process to ensure that the controls necessary to adequately manage the hazards associated with the facilities are installed as part of the project.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the accident prevention program.  \n\nProcess Safety Information \nBOP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This commitment is demonstrated by continued participation in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), as well as through the resources invested in accident prevention as outlined below.  BOP has been awarded the coveted STAR recognition by OSHA for excellence in occupational safety and health.  \n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, We further believe Exxon[Mobil] to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\n\nWith the 2023 submission, BOP has reviewed and updated the Risk Management Plan as required under 40 CFR 68.190(b)(1) within 5 years from the date of the most recent update in 2018.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n \nBOP is located in Baytown, Harris County, Texas.
