Employees who work in or around the ammonia receive ammonia training on an annual basis.  The most recent one was October 18, 2004.\n\nThe safety committee does quarterly inspections of the facility.  Material Safety Data Sheet books are up to date and area where ammonia is used is in great shape.  All valves and parts are labeled according to the Piping, & Instrumentation Diagrams that are posted in each room.  All chemicals are labeled according to their contents.\n\nThere have been no accidents at this facility.  The systems that are in place, the drills, safety practices, and training that New Earth goes through, make an accidental release very unlikely, baring natural disasters."

The system was built in 1995 under the supervision of PermaCold Engineering.  This new system incorporated the latest in new technogly and conformed to all safety standards.  Alarm sensors were installed that detect the smallest leak of 35ppm.  The building is evacuated and the refrigeration department is paged by the computer system.  A second alarm goes off if PPM reaches 250.  The system then shuts down the plant.  If the PPM is 300 or above the refrigeration department calls 911.Some employees are trained and certified as State Industrial Hazmat Technicians.  These employees will supplement the State Hazmat Team as needed.\n\nNew Earth does an annual drill, (11/04) all in conjunction with the local State Hazmat Team.  Our trainer, Monte Keady, is a member of the State Team and a local firefighter.\n\nAll floor plans and any updates to our written response plan are shared with the local State team.  Tours are given as needed to the local State team to keep them familiar with the facilities.\n\nNew Earth has all the response equipment required for an A-level response.  We have SCBA'S, 4 level A suits, decontamination equipment, escape masks, laptop computers, radios, ladders, fans, tarps, hoses, heavy equipment if needed, and B-level suits.  Hazmat team members are trained on such equipment and receive annual physicals.\n\nThe maintenance department performs daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual inspection checks.  A computer program reminds the department of needed scheduled maintenance.  Other repairs are made and recorded as needed.\n\nNew Earth was under OR-OSHA Consultation for Process Safety Management during the initial writing of this program.  Process Hazard Analysis have been conducted using the what if method.  Recommendations hav"
