Facility Accidental Release Policy\n      The owners, management, and employees of United Agri Products West facility at 2010 Norris Road, Bakersfield, California 93306, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of  Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,  the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n2.   Facility Information\n        a.  The primary activity at the United Agri Products West facility is the storage, blending, and sales of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of prepackaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n        b.  The regulated substance Anhydrous Ammonia  is received by rail car and blended into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n        c. Anhydrous Ammonia is received by rail car.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at United Agri Products West is 80,000 pounds.\n3.   The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n      The Worst-Case Release Scenario.  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 80,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, which represents the volume of the  largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is \n0.83 miles.\n      Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history is a release from United Agri Products West.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.30. miles.\n4.    Five year Accident History\n       There have been no accidental release or near misses of Anhydrous Ammonia  or Regulated Pesticides  in the past five years that:\n       a.  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n       Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the Anhydrous Ammonia processes at the Facility  or the handleing of Regulated Pesticides ."
