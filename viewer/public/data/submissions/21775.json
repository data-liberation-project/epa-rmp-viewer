The maximum total quanity of regulated pesticides stored at the facility is 60,000 pounds based on the percent active ingrident.   All pesticides are stored with like or compatible materials based on the product labels and Materials Safety Data Sheets.  Pesticides are stored in a single-story warehouse.  The entire warehouse is 200 feet by 200 feet, with 20 foot walls, and peak  roof height  oof 21 feet.  The floor and side walls are constructed of  concrete.  All electrical wiring is routed in conduit where possible.  The warehouse is wired with an alarm and theft system .   Pesticides are delivered to the facility by truck, and unloaded  outside the warehouse using hand trucks or a forklift.  The materials are stored in the original manufacturer's packing, which include 55-gallon drums, 30-gallon drums , 2 1/2 - gallon plastic bottles, 1-gallon  plastic bottles in cardboard boxes, and bags of varying sizes and   materials. Products containing regulated pesticides are not repackaged at the facility. Pallets containing drums are stacked according to National Fire Protesction Assocation and Uniform Fire Code guidelines.  A 15-foot center aisle provides forklifft access and seperation of incompatibles.  Incompatible materials stored on the same side of the aisle are separeted by a minimum 4 feet.",

This material NH3 is used in a  reactor to blend  for 10-34-0 a fertilizer.   The reactor is operated 24 hours a day for the time it is on site.  It is never left unattended,  The hoses are checked at the begining and end of each  12 hour shift.  The equipment is operated by two men at all times.  The reactor is equipted with an emergenc shut-off valve.  Any loss in preasure, the valve automatically shuts off.  The reactor wi continue to be shut down until pressure loss is found and repaired.  After all the equipment has been checked and reset, the reactor will be restarted.",
