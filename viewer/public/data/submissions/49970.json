              "Description": "The Roy Farms, Inc. has a PSM and RMP, which covers all four machine rooms (Machine Room 1&2, 3, and 4) and the associated refrigerated facilities. Although there are four separate machine rooms, the facilities are all connected together by either piping or the physical buildings. Due to the similarity of the systems, and the interconnection of piping and/or buidlings there was a single PHA done for the entire facility.  These systems are nearly identical, however machine room 3 does use ammonia pumps to supply liquid ammonia to the system, and the other machine rooms use system pressure for delivering ammonia liquid.  All machine rooms have screw compressors, and evaporative style condensers. The systems are monitored and controlled by a computer system.  This system is connected by auto dialer to the phone system so if there is any alarm conditions a refrigeration operator is notified, and they must respond to clear the alarm condition.  The system has ammonia detection in all refrigerated areas of the facility, with automatic showdown and pumpout if ammonia is detected.  All pressure vessels have safety relief valves, and all compressors have high pressure safety cutouts.  All employees who work at the facility are trained in the emgerency action plan, and are instructed in what they should do if an ammonia release occurs.",

      "SummaryText": "Roy Farms, Inc. operates a refrigerated facility having four machine rooms serving storages for frozen products, fruits, and other products that require refrigeration. The facility is located a few miles east of Moxee, WA., and about a mile north of State Highway 24.  The facility frozen storage facility operates year around, however the other refrigerated facilities typically are loaded during the autumn over a several week period, then the product is held in storage for approximately 6 to 11 months.  Throughout the year there are forklifts and trucks operating at the various refrigerated facilities.  A refrigeration operator checks the operation of the system several times a week, while continuous monitoring and alarming is done by the facility computer control system.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat.  It is present as both a liquid under pressure, and as a vapor in the system.\n\nTo maintain a safe facility operation the Roy Farms, Inc. has developed an emergency action plan that provides instructions to all employees of what actions to take if an ammonia release is detected.  All refrigerated areas in the facility are monitored by an ammonia detection system, which will automatically shutdown and pump out any alarming area.  Any alarm would also be sent to the refrigeration operator by a dial up modem.  Also, the computer system will notify the refrigeration operator on any alarming or out of normal condition in the system (temperatures/pressures).  All employees at the facility receive semi-annual training on the emergency action plan.  Also, the East Valley Fire Department annually visits the facility to coordinate with the Roy Farms, Inc. on their emergency action plan.\n\nThe facility has complied with both State and Federal regulations regarding ammonia used as a refrigerant, and has in place both the OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard (PSM)"

      "SummaryText": " (29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) (40 CFR, Part 68).  These programs are readily available to on-site personal to help in maintaining a safe operating facility.  As required by the RMP an ?Off-site Consequence Analysis? has been done for the facility to determine what impact the ?Worse Case?, and the more realistic ?Alternate Case? releases of ammonia would have to the surrounding area.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the system during the last five years.\n\nTo deal with any possible release of ammonia Roy Farms, Inc. maintains an ongoing relationship with an experienced refrigeration contractor in Yakima, and with the East Valley Fire Department.  In the event of a significant accident, the fire department is about five minutes away; response from the refrigeration contractor (located in Yakima) is about thirty minutes.  Due to the available trained personnel and the sites rural location Roy Farms, Inc. has determined that their emergency response strategy will be essentially passive.  The safety of their employees is of prime importance, so an emergency action plan focusing on the safe evacuation of all personnel is very important, and all personnel are trained in what to do if an emergency occurs.  Ammonia canister masks are available onsite for use by those trained to do so.  In the event of a large release, the release would most likely be over before a proper Haz-Mat team could be assembled on site.  In such cases, it is not expected or intended that persons would attempt to enter the facility until proper trained personnel with the appropriate PPE arrive."
