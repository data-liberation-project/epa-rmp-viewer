Three of the buildings are used to process chemicals.  Only a portion on one of those buildings, and three outdoor tanks handle epichlorohydrin.  One building contains administrative staff and our QC lab and the remaining buildings are used for warehousing or are vacant.  The manufacturing areas include standard chemical processing equipment, such as storage and mixing tanks, reactors, heat exchangers and pumps. \n\nUSEPA\u0092s RMP Comp web-based system was used to evaluate in determining the potential for offsite impacts for various events involving RMP chemicals at our facility.  Included in these analyses was a worst-case scenario.  A summary of each scenario is described below:\n\nEpichlorohydrin: In the worst case, the entire contents of a reactor, including epichlorohydrin, to the building floor (inside) and begins to evaporate.  The epichlorohydrin volume is that of our product which uses the most per batch.   The distance to the impact endpoint is 0.7 miles.  We comply with the requirements of EPA\u0092s RMP rule and OSHA\u0092s PSM rule including Process Hazard analyses, follow through on recommendations, operating procedures (which include normal start up and shut down, emergency start up and shut down, safe operating limits and actions to take should those limits be approached preventive maintenance on our reactors and vessels, operating procedures and training, emergency procedures.  Our last coordination with local EMS was July 21, 2024.\n\n\nMcGean Rohco has developed and employs procedures to control manufacturing and equipment operation.

Employees at McGean-Rohco are trained to notify the appropriate responders and other agencies as needed. These are listed in the McGean-Rohco Integrated Contingency Plan.  McGean-Rohco works closely with the Cuyahoga Heights Fire & Police Departments and with its neighbors in training and sharing of information.  Employees have received both on-and off-site training.
