This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of releases of highly hazardous materials.\n\nAs stated by Jim Albaugh, President of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, \"Considering the criticality and complexity of our products and systems, quality and safety are core values for every one of us.  Emphasis is shifting from detection to the prevention of problems and hazards through a systematic approach to quality and safety.  This emphasis, starting with design and development, continues through procurement, manufacturing and operational/customer support.\"  \n\nThis emphasis on safety is implemented by the Boeing Environmental Safety and Health (ESH) organization, which develops and assembles USEPA/CalARP RMPs and OSHA/CalOSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plans, in coordination with the facility involved.  The facility manager implements the RMP and PSM programs, fulfilling the Boeing commitment to protect workers and the community.  The ESH emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) and the surrounding community, and are in compliance with the USEPA/CalARP and OSHA/CalOSHA PSM requirements.\n\nABL and Chlorine/Ammonia Handling\nThe ABL Program is part of a Missile Defense Agency program comprised of the United States Air Force, the Boeing Company (Integrated Defense Systems), Northrop Grumman, and the Lockheed Martin Company.  ABL is located at the Edwards AFB, CA, South Base Birk Flight Test Facility (BFTF). Edwards AFB and BFTF feature controlled access for 24 ho"

This testing was done at the System Integration Laboratory (SIL) where the ABL high energy laser was installed on a surrogate 747 fuselage.  When testing was completed in 2005, this lab was torn down and the aircraft chemical system components were refurbished.  The other ground support equipment was deactivated and refurbished for later testing.  Since then, all equipment has been refurbished and reactivated.  The aircraft system has been installed on the ABL aircraft, YAL-1A, and the ground systems reactivated to support the High Power Systems Integration (HPSI) testing.  Chemical operations with chlorine and ammonia are planned to resume at the end of July, 2008.\n\nChlorine and ammonia storage is performed at the Integrated Maintenance Facility (IMF) Building, located approximately 1.2 miles east of the BFTF.  Chlorine is used as a laser reagent for the ABL Aircraft Laser systems.  Ammonia is used for refrigeration purposes for the ABL Laser systems.  Currently, the ABL Aircraft is located at Hangar 151 at the BFTF.  For the first portion of the HPSI testing, the Aircraft chemical systems will be continuously connected to the ground chemical systems.  Toward the end of 2008, the test program will transition to the flight test portion of test program.  For flight testing, the aircraft chemical systems will be loaded/unloaded in Hangar 151, as is done for ground testing.  However, once the aircraft is ready to leave for flight testing, the aircraft will be disconnected from the ground systems and leave the hangar.  Before or after a test, it is conceivable that the aircraft may stop outside of the hangar, at Spur 6.  In order to accommodate that possibility, new processes has been added to the HPSI RMPSubmit to accommodate the aircraft being stationed at Spur 6.  Since this condition is still quite a way in the future, there are a nu"

Those future dates are estimated completion dates for the various reviews and analyses associated with preparing the aircraft systems for the flight test program.\n\nComputerized programs control test conditions, including stopping the test if parameters fall outside preset ranges (an active mitigation measure).  Personnel monitor tests from inside control rooms and on the ABL aircraft.  On the aircraft, the chemical systems are isolated from the operators by a pressure bulkhead.  The test personnel are located forward of the bulkhead and the chemical systems are located aft of the bulkhead.  The aircraft maintains a slight positive pressure forward of the bulkhead to prevent chemical migration forward of the bulkhead.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of chlorine releases in accordance with the USEPA RMP, CalARP, OSHA PSM and CalOSHA PSM rule.  This program is based on the following key elements:\nHigh level of training of the operators\nPrevention maintenance\nUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with participation of the operators\nPerformance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\nImplementation of an auditing and inspection program\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), chemical-resistant suits, face goggles and face shields, awareness of chlorine hazardous properties, and presence of chlorine detectors and scrubbers.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nNo accidental releases from chlorine or ammonia processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage (40 CFR 68.42) have occurred at ABL in the past five years.\n\nEmergency R"

      "SummaryText": "esponse Program\nAn ABL Emergency Response Plan is in place; this includes alert systems, notification procedures, and evacuations plans.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted periodically.  These drills are joint drills between the ABL program and the base fire department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at the start of a new test series.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHA) of the chlorine and ammonia systems were performed, using the Hazard Operability (HAZOP) procedure for SIL testing in November 2004.  Action items requiring replacements or modifications, review or further investigations are identified and addressed.  These included technical items, such as installation of new mitigation or control equipment, and procedural/managerial items, such as improved maintenance or training.  \n\nAction items requiring replacements or modifications, review or further investigations were identified and addressed.  A PHA for the ground chlorine and ammonia supply systems was performed, in March, 2008 using the HAZOP methodology.  The chemical storage at the IMF was reviewed following the What-If methodology in February, 2008.  A PHA for the aircraft chlorine and ammonia systems was performed in June, 2008 using the HAZOP methodology.  Priority 1 action items from these reviews will be completed prior to the use of these systems."
