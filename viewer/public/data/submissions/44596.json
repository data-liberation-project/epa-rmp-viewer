      "SummaryText": "The Rend Lake Conservancy District uses chlorine gas contained in one ton cylinders as a backup disinfection method for water treatment.  The system has implemented the use of less toxic disinfection chemicals to minimize the quanity of chlorine gas stored at the site and has a goal to completely eliminate the storage of chlorine gas within the next five years.  Since the chlorine gas is only used as a backup system, the chlorine cylinder isolation valves are normally closed.  Immediately downstream of the cyclinder isolation valves are vacuum shutoff valves that automatically secure gas flow in the event of a leak and a loss of vacuum in the system.  The chlorine cylinders are stored inside a block and brick building designed to comply with the Recommended Standards for Water Works (Ten State Standards).  These design features greatly minimize the risk of chlorine leaks.  The District has developed a manual for the Risk Management Plan that provides a summary of periodic requirements, a printout of the RMP Submittal, an RMP Emergency Response Plan, a summary of safety information including the chlorine MSDS, a copy of the most recent hazard review checklist, a copy of the standard operating procedures, a summary of the training requirements, a summary of the preventative maintenance requirements, and a copy of the most recent compliance audit.  The last six components discussed above are key elements of the District's chlorine release prevention program.  As required, the District has completed both a worst case and an alternative release scenario  for chemical release hazard assessment.  The offsite impacts and the design considerations included in the hazard assessment are dscussed in the RMP Submittal.  The information learned from this hazard assessment was used in development of the Emergecny Response Plan.  The Water Superintendant has been assigned the responsibility for oversight and implementation of the RMP requirenments."
