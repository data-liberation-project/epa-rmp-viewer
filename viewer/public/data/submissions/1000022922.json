      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nNew Albertsons Inc. is a diversified retailer of grocery products throughout the United States. Albertsons operates many retail grocery stores throughout southern California that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in Brea, CA. Albertsons Refrigerated  Distribution Center #8261 located on this facility employees 964 people and utilizes refrigeration grade anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of highly Hazardous Chemicals. Pursuant to PSM regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Albertsons has developed a comprehensive written PSM program to protect its employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals(anhydrous annonia)utilized onsite. Albertsons Brea DC has not experienced a release of anhydrous ammonia involving consequences that has affected the environment or offsite parties in the last 5 years. The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Brea facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm, and was revalidated to meet PSM and RMP Requirements in August of 2006.  Albertsons PSM program implementation includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The program includes preventative maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches "

Albertsons undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the system (although such a release is highly unlikely)in accordance with the RMP requirements.  \n\nAlbertson's BREA DC is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the facility. Facility Management and associates that oversee the refrigeration system operation at the facility are involved in the design, operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Albertson's employees have been and continue to be involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs at the site.  The facilities emergency response plan is revieweed and modified as needed (annually at a minimum, Albertsons Brea facility also maintains an onsiet emergency response teamwhose members complete an initial 24 hr training course and then receive annual 8 Hr refresher training.  Albertsons Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at the Brea Facility should be addressed to Albertsons Environmental Affairs Department."
