      "SummaryText": "ilding.\r\n\r\nMechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation, compression, condensation, and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with refrigerant. Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle is a closed-loop process. The refrigeration cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat of vaporization for cooling. The refrigeration system utilizes these phenomenon's to remove heat from a desired area, and then to discard that heat, through condensation, to an area where it is of no consequence.\r\n\r\n                 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nSysco Arizona has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In Addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\n1.  EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\nEvery section of the PSM/RMP program must allow for employee participation in its development and implementation. The plan allowing for this participation must be documented. Employees and their representatives must have access to all information required to be developed for the Process Safety Management program without regard to possible trade secret status of such information.  Sysco Arizona believes that safety and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\r\n\r\n2.  PROCESS SA"

The information to be compiled about the chemicals needs to be comprehensive enough for an accurate assessment of the fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity hazards, the health and safety hazards to workers, and the corrosion effects on process equipment as well as monitoring and safety related equipment. MSDS information can provide a portion of the required data but other information will be required.\r\n\r\nProcess technology information is also required. This includes information on the amount of hazardous material stored and used at the facility as well as operating limits for the process. Diagrams of the system and information on all of the equipment utilized in the system are required. Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are included in the Process Safety Information.\r\n\r\nSysco Arizona maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration process.\r\n\r\n3.  PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is the basis for many of the decisions and procedures associated with an effective PSM/RMP program. It is a systematic effort to determine the potential hazards associated with the process and to evaluate mitigation alternatives including equipment modifications, procedural modifications, training, and administrative controls. An effective PHA considers and analyzes the potential consequences associated with a release of the hazardous materials including fires, explosions, and exposure of people to toxic materials. It focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external events.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that both operator safety as well as off-site safety is addressed,"

In addition to the normal awareness training, which informs personnel of the hazards of the chemical and the safety precautions to use, training in operating procedures and practices, emergency response, and other required management controls are required.\r\n\r\nSysco Arizona has identified the personnel who require training, developed a training protocol with procedures and objectives, and maintains a record of personnel training. Regular evaluation of the training programs are completed to ensure that it is appropriate information to the employees in a useful and understandable way.\r\n\r\nIf outside employees (maintenance or contract) are performing work which might impact the refrigeration system, the (Facility Manager - David Karlsrud)(Safety Manager - Todd Larson) has an obligation to assure that they have been properly trained by their employer and have been informed of any hazardous conditions and the proper procedures to be utilized at the Sysco Arizona, Inc. facility.\r\n\r\n6.  CONTRACTOR SAFETY\r\nAny use of outside contractors who work in and around the refrigeration system requires that these contractors have accomplished the training, utilize proficient personnel, and have been informed of the necessary health and safety aspects of working in the area. The goal is to assure that contractor employees perform work in a safe manner and do not endanger themselves, other employees, or the facility. Sysco Arizona has developed a plan for screening potential contractors to ensure satisfactory performance.\r\n\r\n7.  PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\r\nFor a new design or the addition of significant changes to the process, Sysco Arizona conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)  to determine that the changes are not themselves deficient or that the addition of the new portions of the system will adversely affect the original system.

MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\nSysco Arizona has a formal maintenance program in place for all systems using regulated substances (i.e. ammonia). This program consists of routine (scheduled) inspection, testing, overhaul, and replacement as needed. Equipment is categorized and ranked with respect to the maintenance involved. This maintenance and inspection information includes all equipment such as storage tanks, compressors, condensers, evaporators, process piping relief and vent systems, fire protection system components, emergency shutdown systems, and alarms. Each component has been placed into a category that indicates how maintenance and inspection will be performed on that class of components.\r\n\r\n9.  HOT WORK PERMIT\r\nA Hot Work Permit management control program has been employed at Sysco Arizona that recognizes that extra care is required for non-routine work practices. This program advises the personnel that significant potential hazards exist and that extra care should be taken in certain circumstances. This ensures that employees, contractors, and company property are protected against fire, explosion, and other dangers resulting from hot work. Formal procedures exist for these programs and paperwork associated with ongoing work are kept on file.\r\n\r\n10.
