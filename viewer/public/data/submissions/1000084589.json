Chemtrade Corporate Policy dictates that facilities minimize the potential for adverse effects to the environment as well as to the health of employees and local citizens by operating plants safely.  This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the corporate policy and compliance procedures that are available to all employees.  Chemtrade stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in the employee training programs and in written materials available to employees.  As a method of promoting compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental, health, and safety regulations, Chemtrade performs corporate audits.  Richmond is audited every three years via this program.  Methods of minimizing or reusing wastes, in addition to using energy and materials wisely, are encouraged.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use accidental release prevention programs to make sure our processes are managed safely, as well as to comply with regulatory requirements such as the USEPA's Risk Management Planning regulations.  However, if a release does occur, we have prepared our personnel and local emergency response groups to respond to the release.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled - Chemtrade Richmond produces Sulfuric Acid and Ultrapure Sulfuric Acid.  Oleum is produced as an intermediate chemical for use in production of Ultrapure Sulfuric Acid having overall ionic contaminant levels of less than 400 parts per trillion. Sulfuric Acid and Ultrapure Sulfuric Acid are used in many applications including pharmaceuticals, batteries, and plastics.  A major use of the acid produced at this facility is in the production"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) - The site maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, and, equipment specification sheets.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - The site conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and effectively controlled.  The HAZOP methodology is primarily used to carry out these analyses.  Studies utilize an appropriate team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on a five year basis.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the site's covered process, written operating procedures are maintained.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed annually and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining - The site has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the processes are competent in the associated operating procedures and s"

Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years and more frequently as needed for required or updated process and safety topics.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI) - The site carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, critical instruments, emergency shutdown systems, controls, compressors and pumps.  Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices are utilized to carry out appropriate maintenance.  These personnel are also offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) - Written procedures are in place at the site to safely manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to safely work with the modification.\r\n\r\nPrestartup Safety Review (PSSR) - PSSR related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted by appropriate personnel as a regular practice at the site.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits - The site conducts audits of compliance systems for RMP requirements on a regular basis.  These audits are carried out at least once every 3 years by a team of qualified personnel.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - The site promptly and carefully investigates any incident that has resulted in, or"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - The site believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Site employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the accidental release prevention programs, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.  Safe job performance is required for all employees at the site.\r\n\r\nContractors - On occasion, the site hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The site has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also required to inform the site of any hazards they may introduce at the site.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors, however, are never engaged to operate the site processes.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History - On January 4, 2018, an oleum leak on a heat exchanger resulted in a vapor cloud release of sulfur trioxide (SO3).

      "SummaryText": "rea Air Quality District.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan (ERP) - The site uses a written ERP to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, sheltering-in-place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place that would require a modified emergency response.  The site also coordinates our plans and actions with local agencies which provide the site with additional emergency response capability.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - Studies associated with prevention program elements such as PHA's including external events analyses and seismic analyses, incident investigation, change management, and compliance audits are regularly conducted at the site to verify designs and identify potential hazards.  Recommendations may be developed as a result of these studies and as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions.  Once formulated, recommendations are reviewed and corresponding action items are developed to implement appropriate recommendations.  Communication of these action items or planned activities informs the public of measurable improvements for safety that are being continuously incorporated at the facility.  Additionally the site is Responsible Care 14001 certified."
