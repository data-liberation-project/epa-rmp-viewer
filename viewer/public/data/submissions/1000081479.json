We believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.  If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plans, please call us at (808) 965-6233, or visit our website at http://www.ormat.com.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOur company is committed to operating a safe and environmentally sound power generating facility.  Protecting our community neighbors and employees is a high priority.  This ongoing commitment is demonstrated through the resources we invest for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facility and related activities.\n\nIn order to ensure the most efficient use of the geothermal resources available on the Big Island, PGV uses some materials that are classified as toxic or flammable in its power generation process.  We are committed to complying with governing laws, regulations, and standards as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain a safe operation, including the storage and use of the toxic or flammable materials.\n\nOur facility design, operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.  However, if a major release should occur, our comprehensive emergency response organization will be immediately activated to bring under control and mitigate the effects of an emergency release of toxic or flammable materials.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nPGV produces electric energy from a geothermal power plant and geothermal wellfield located on the Big Island of Hawaii.  The project is located approximately 21 miles south of Hilo in the Puna Distri"

      "SummaryText": "ct.  PGV is sited on about 815 acres of land in the Kapoho area, of which approximately 40 acres house the facility.\n\nOur modern facility supplies electric power to homes, businesses, and a wide variety of consumers across the Big Island.  PGV is the only commercial geothermal power plant in the state of Hawaii and is currently contracted to produce 38 megawatts of power...or enough electricity to meet the energy needs of about 25,000 Big Island residents and visitors.  By making effective use of our geothermal resources, we can decrease our near-total reliance on imported oil for our energy needs.  We are proud to have produced more than 5.6 billion kilowatt hours of electricity through September 2021, thereby displacing more than 140 million gallons of oil.\n\nIn addition, the 30-plus people employed at PGV represent a real cross-section of the local community.  Our families own homes in the area, attend local schools and churches, and are members of numerous community organizations.  Our annual payroll alone adds ~$2 million directly to the local economy.\n\nPGV also regularly contributes staff time and dollars to local programs and activities, including: $2,000 each year to RIF (Reading is Fundamental), $50,000 each year to Hawaii County, employs one student from Pahoa High School each summer, and sponsors college scholarships for continuing education to Pahoa students.\n\nPGV uses one (1) chemical in sufficient quantities to be regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  This is n-pentane (CAS# 109-66-0), a regulated flammable substance.  Pentane is used as a working fluid in our power generation process.\n\nOther materials at our facility are not regulated under RMP because we either handle them in quantities below the thresholds for regulation or in very low concentrations (i.e., below 1%).  These include geothermal well-fluids that contain small amounts of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nAs part of our risk management planning, we ha"

      "SummaryText": "ve specifically identified the type of event that, should it ever occur, would have the most negative impacts on our employees or our neighbors.  This is known as the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS).  As defined by EPA, we are required to assume that the numerous engineering and administrative safety controls we have in place to prevent or mitigate such accidents have all failed at once.  Under this regulation, we are required to identify one event involving pentane, a flammable material.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPGV has implemented a comprehensive program known as Process Safety Management (PSM) to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals.  PSM is an integral part of working safely here at PGV.  PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained and qualified; equipment designs are appropriate to applicable standards; equipment replacements are \"like in kind\"; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  Some of the many, specific safety features to prevent a chemical accident include:\n\nAA\u00b7 Extensive safety information about the process available to employees.\n\nAA\u00b7 Written operating procedures that include emergency response actions.\n\nAA\u00b7 Comprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistently safe work-practices.\n\nAA\u00b7 Maintenance programs to ensure ongoing equipment reliability - includes equipment testing and inspection.\n\nAA\u00b7 Compliance auditing to ensure standards are being followed.\n\nAA\u00b7 A safety procedure to review proposed plant modifications before they are implemented for possible hazards.\n\nAA\u00b7 Safety pre-qualification for all contractors.\n\nAA\u00b7 Safety reviews prior to start-up of our process; and,\n\nAA\u00b7 Safety procedures that control hazards during special operations such as welding and cutting.\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOver the past"

      "SummaryText": "five years, the PGV site has experienced an outstanding record of accident prevention that demonstrates its commitment to public and employee safety.  Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.\n\nThe RMP requires that all incidents involving pentane that resulted in any off-site impact or a significant on-site impact be reported in this document.  There were no incidents during the previous five-year period.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPGV maintains a written plan of action to deal with emergency situations that may threaten the health, safety, and welfare of our employees or our community neighbors.  This emergency response plan ensures that:\n\nAA\u00b7 The chain-of-command and responsibilities have been clearly defined both for our employees and off-site responders in the event of an emergency.\n\nAA\u00b7 Emergency equipment and services are available both on-site and in the community.\n\nAA\u00b7 Potential emergency situations have been identified and prepared for.\n\nAA\u00b7 Warning systems, which alert our employees and prompt them to notify our community emergency responders, are in place.\n\nAA\u00b7 Our employees are trained in the proper response to an incident; and\n\nAA\u00b7 Periodic emergency preparedness drills are conducted to ensure readiness.\n\nWe have developed this plan in coordination with numerous public agencies that have approved of our planning.  These include:\n\nAA\u00b7 Hawaii County Planning Department,\n\nAA\u00b7 Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources,\n\nAA\u00b7 Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency, and\n\nAA\u00b7 Hawaii Department of Health.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPGV is committed to continuously improving our overall safety and environmental performance.

Inventory in the\nMotive Fluid Storage Tank is limited to 90% of water capacity per SOP-7 at Puna. Since these tanks are in containment that will\nhold the entire vessel quantity, the offsite impact will be mitigated.\n\u0095 The vaporizers at both GCCU and the Expansion contain less motive fluid than the storage tanks, but they are uncontained and\nresult in the greatest distance to endpoint from each process.\n\u0095 Ambient conditions used to evaluate the distance to the overpressure endpoint are the default conditions, selected because they\nare allowed by regulation and utilized by RMP Comp. Rural topography is utilized.\nAlternate Case Release Scenarios\n\u0095 The alternate release scenario of a transfer hose rupture was selected as the most likely scenario given the frequency of\noperational transfers that utilize transfer hose. Transfer between a delivery truck and storage tank involved the largest transfer\nrate via hose.\no Shutdown of flow on the delivery truck side would occur immediately, as the delivery personnel stand by at the remote\nshut off valve. Closure of the automated isolation valve at the storage tank will be activated remotely by the CRO. A\nplant operator also stands by during offloading and can alert the CRO of the need to close the isolation valve. The\nelectrical actuation components of the isolation valve are classified for operation in a Class I, Div 2 electrical hazardous\narea and will function in the presence of motive fluid vapor.\no A conservative time estimate of 10 minutes to achieve isolation is assumed. The actual time will likely be shorter.\n\u0095 The following alternate release scenarios were considered, but not selected"
