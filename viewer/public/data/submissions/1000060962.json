The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forward these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Chisholm periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Chisholm management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at Chisholm within the last 5 years; In order to maintain this record of no such incidents, we place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety program.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction facility, it is our policy to follow our E"

The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nEnlink Midstream has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exist of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nChisholm has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.

The plant consists of inlet gas compression, separation and filtration, 10,000 BPD stabilizer, 100 GPM amine treatment unit, 100MMSCFD cryogenic processing unit, overhead compression, residue compression, and, including all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in six 400-barrel tanks in a concrete-diked containment area and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGL from the cryogenic unit and natural gas from residue compression are sent offsite via pipeline without intermediate storageThe facility is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the regulation. The worst case scenario (described in the RMP submittal) is the loss of the entire contents of the largest vessel, with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion. An alternative release is the loss of NGL due to a hose break during loading. There are numerous safety devices to prevent such events from occurring at the facility. We have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Kingfisher County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public. The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Chisholm Gas Processing Plant (Chisholm). Because the processes at the plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the company's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of"

New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Enlink Midstream has programs in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. Enlink Midstream strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail gate safety meetings, Hazard Communications, and other training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\n\r\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). The PSI will be useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge or training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency response plan. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. The Chisholm Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Chisholm Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility, or at minimum every five years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations for Chisholm, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annual reviewed by management as current and accurate. The review"
