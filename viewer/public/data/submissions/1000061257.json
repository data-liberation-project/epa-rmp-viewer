Both the Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent oversee the day to day operations.\n\nFacility policies prohibit untrained persons from operating the chlorine system or changing tanks.  If an incident should occur, it is investigated with diligence and responsible parties are held accountable.  Every employee has safety training each month reguardless of shift.  This training is documented and on file.  The vendor of the chlorine provides annual updates on chlorine safety.  Critical components of the system are replaced annually to insure accuracy and that the possibility of failure is kept to a minimum.\n\nThe stationary source is on building designed for the chlorine system.  Inside, there are four-one ton cylinders attached to a feed line system, each with its own regulator and line.  The feed required for proper bacteria control requires all tanks to be on line.  This area is enclosed with an alarm and monitoring system.  Procedures are posted in this location for easy reference.  There are always a minimum of two employees present when tank work is being completed.\n\n\nWorst case secenario is offloading a one ton cylinder and causing a crack or rupture.  Total release would be 2000 pounds of Chlorine.  RMP Comp was used with a release time of 10 minutes at a  rate of 110 pounds per minute.  Wind speed 1.5 m/sec.  Toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles.   \n\nAlternative release secenario is a leak in the hose (line) system.  This would be identified by alarm system and the process shut down without delay.  Employees are trained to respond and repair the leak or call outside repair service if it is outside of their abilities.  RMP Comp was used to determine endpoint of 0.10 miles, effectively staying on the facility property.  Maximun release of 535 pounds in an enclosed area for a period of 5 minutes.\n\nARP is ba"
