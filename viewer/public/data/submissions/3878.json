      "SummaryText": "1.0\t\tSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n1.1\t\tSOURCE\n\nThe Fairmont Roberts Dairy in Kansas City is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store fluid milk and related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 15,600 pounds (i.e.,  3,100 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 8,100 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 80%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains only 4,600 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\n\n\n1.2\t\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a single-stage system.  The high side compressor suction draws from the accumulator at about 25 psig.  This accumulator receives suction from the refrigerated tanks, glycol chillers, cooler units, and ice builders.  Liquid, which is trapped in the accumulator is returned to the system by pumps.\n\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas)"

      "SummaryText": ", at 150 to 175 psig, is vented to roof-mounted condensing towers.   The condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the refrigeration equipment.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, suction accumulator, receiver, and chillers from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for the accumulator.  The high pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n\n\n\n2.0\t\tPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or represent an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the property line).\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative release) were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the ammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  This endpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (the \"Model Plan\"), dated November 1998.  This guidance document used the SACRUNCH atmospheric dis"

Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was estimated to be 5,600 feet or 1.1 mile.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the high pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs annually by a boiler and machinery insurance inspector who has been certified by the National Board.  In addition, the vessel is visually inspected daily.\n\nThere are only two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment of the receiver:  (1) the internal pressure were to increase uncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside; or (2) rupture of the vessel wall due to inadvertent contact (e.g., vehicular) from the outside.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) of 250 psig and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately 1,000 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  Such pressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external cause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface radiation from a high"

A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRV continued to function.  Actuation of the SRV would result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative release scenario.  The SRVs are replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\n\nFurther, rupture of the vessel from the outside as a result of inadvertent vehicular contact is unlikely since the unit is provided with substantial barrier protection to preclude this occurrence.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\n\n* The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\n\n* Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of this receiver;\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service and the vessels are relatively new;\n\n* Safety relief valves limit operating pressures;\n\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessel;\n\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel;\n\n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases;\n\n* Main ammonia shut-offs have been labeled to allow personnel to stop the flow of ammonia quickly in an emergency.\n\n* Inadvertent vehicular contact with the vessel is unlikely since the unit is surrounded by guard posts to preclude this occurrence.\n\n\n2.2\t\tALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE\n\nThe alternative, or \"more likely\", scenario is considered to be defined by a release of am"

This release is representative of a small pipe or vessel leak.  It would also be representative of a flange leak or pump seal  failure.  Because the high pressure receiver and some piping are located outdoors, passive (building) mitigation1 was not used to reduce the release rate or the distance to the endpoint.  Active mitigation2 was considered, because it is believed that emergency responders could identify and stop the leak in less than 60 minutes.  However, reducing the release duration does not change the TEP distance obtained from the Model plan.  \n\nUsing the specified meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for the \"more likely\" release scenario was estimated to be 450 feet or 0.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\n\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n* Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\n\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system;\n\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and\n\n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing valves in the liquid lines.\n\n\n3.0\t\tPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release scenarios described in Section 2.0.

      "SummaryText": "ure relief valves, ammonia vessel level controls, and safety interlocks are used in the refrigeration system.\n\n* Periodic inspection and calibration is performed on liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches and shutdown devices that have safety implications.\n\n* Periodic inspections are performed for major powered equipment, including compressors, pumps and large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechanical failure.\n\n* Proper design, including adherence to recognized safety codes.\n\n* Adherence to fire codes and preparation for fires, storms, or events which could impact the ammonia system.\n\n* Planning with the local fire department to ensure a rapid response to potential incidents involving the system or external events, such as storms or tornadoes.\n\n* Prevention program compliance audits are performed every three years to verify that the elements are being properly implemented.  Any deficiency found in an audit is corrected.\n\n4.0\t\tACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (since June 1994) that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on-site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.0\t\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\nThe facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia.\n\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for employees, coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of the facility.  The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refers to other pertinent elements of the management"
