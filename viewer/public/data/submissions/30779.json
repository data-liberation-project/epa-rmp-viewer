      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - PROJECT 7 WATER AUTHORITY\n   The Project 7 Water Authority was established in 1977 for the purpose of constructing a Water Treatment Plant and Transmission system to serve the residents of the Uncompahgre Valley.  The Project WTP was constructed in 1979-80 and was placed in service in July 1980.  \n   Project 7 serves the following entities:  City of Montrose, City of Delta, Town of Olathe, Tri-County Water Conservancy District, Menoken Water District and Chipeta Water District. \n   The WTP is rated at approximately 20 MGD and experienced a peak day of approximately 16 MGD in 2003.  The treatment plant is a conventional type treatment facility employing a full treatment process.  This includes coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection.  Project 7 utilizes chlorine as its primary disinfectant and has done so since 1980.  The chlorine is received and stored as compressed gas (liquid) in one ton cylinders.  The maximum number of cylinders on site at any one time is four. \n   Over the years, Project 7 has made many improvements to the chlorine facility, including the elimination of unnecessary equipment (old) and replacing it with the newer, more efficient chlorinators.  Additionally, the facility has been modified to comply with the requirements of the Confined Space Regulations.  The facility is equipped with leak detection sensors and an alarm system.  The appropriate Oxygen Breathing Apparatus (2 sets), Level A Containment suits (2), and a complete repair kit as prescribed by the Chlorine Institute are also on site.  A \"Chlorine Emergency\" procedure (written) has been developed and has been in place.  Routine training is done by/with Project personnel as well as the local fire department.  \n   All Project 7 personnel are Certified Operators in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The RMP identifies the Montrose Fire Protection District as the primary emergency responder in the event of a major chlorine leak.  T"

Project 7 made a conversion from propane to natural gas during 2002.  \n   In summary, Project 7 is also completing the process of submitting their \"Vulnerability Assessment\" and the required Emergency Response Plan to EPA by June 30, 2004."
