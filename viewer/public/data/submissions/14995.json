This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Waste Water Treatment.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility. Chlorine is used for disinfecting sewage effluent.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 6000.00 lb..\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for a program 3 toxic substance as a class involves a catastrophic release from a chlorine vessel.  In this scenario 2000 lbs. of Chlorine is released. over 10 minutes. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 3ppm.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from a 1/2 inch hole in a vessel. .  The scenario involves the release of 370 lbs. of chlorine over 10-minute period.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm of Chlorine is 0.3 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Pre"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nChickasha WWTP maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, HAZOP and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every 2 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/22/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Chickasha WWTP maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nChickasha WWTP has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nChickasha WWTP carries out highly documented maintenance checks on"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Chickasha WWTP to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 04/19/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Chickasha WWTP. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nChickasha WWTP conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 4/22/99.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nChickasha WWTP promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Chickasha WWTP has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nChickasha WWTP has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nChickasha WWTP carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
