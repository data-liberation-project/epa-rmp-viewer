      "SummaryText": "ard for Continued Excellence (PACE) from the Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Louisiana.\n\n\n\nThe Syngenta St. Gabriel Plant site instills a strong site level commitment to health safety and the environment.  These are evident in several plant policies and procedures, including Plant Procedure A-1, which is the Statement of Policy.  This procedure states that \"safety is a primary concern and a core value\" and that \"it is the policy of the St. Gabriel Plant management that safety is a definite job requirement at every level of the organization\".\n\n   \n\nRelevant to the Risk Management Program are the following Plant Procedures:\n\n\n\n      M-1 Risk Management Program (RMP) Compliance \n\nThis procedure is to provide a USEPA Risk Management Program overview.  The procedure establishes measures and a Management System (per EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR 68) to ensure that accidental releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals are minimized and that procedures and an emergency response program are in place to lessen the consequence should a large release occur. \n\n\n\n      C-8 Process Safety Management & Risk Management Program Policy\n\nTo establish measures per OSHA Process Safety Management standard (PSM, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA Risk Management Program (RMP, 40 CFR 68) to ensure that accidental releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals are minimized and procedures are in place to lessen the consequence should a large release occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\n\n\n Syngenta has separated the facility into several processes.  Of these, the processes subject to RMP and the regulated substances handled by these processes are as follows:  \n\nHCN/ HPF and associated Tank Farms - anhydrous ammonia; sulfur dioxide; hydrocyanic acid; chlorine; isopropylamine; ethylamine\n\nMMU - Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate\n\n\n\nNote that in completing Section 7.0 of the RMP, the description of th"

This was done because the Process Hazard Analysis for each of these is done independently of the others.  Also note that the information provided for each of these process hazard analysis represents the entire unit and associated chemicals as opposed to describing only the regulated compounds. \n\n\n\n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; \n\n\n\nSyngenta is regulated by the Process Safety Management regulations as well as the Risk Management Program and as such conducts various process hazard analyses to prevent accidental releases from the facility. These analyses are conducted on unit equipment as well as processes and procedures.  In selecting a worst-case release scenario, the facility also considered (1) smaller quantities of regulated substances handled at higher process temperatures or pressure or (2) the proximity of a regulated substance in relation to the facility boundary.  Additionally, failure scenarios identified in the Process Hazard Analysis were considered for the selection and evaluation of the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nSyngenta also has comprehensive procedures for inspection and maintenance of equipment.  The Syngenta Maintenance Department maintains a Preventive/Predictive Maintenance (PM/PDM) Manual.  This comprehensive manual documents the system used to ensure that maintenance and inspections are conducted effectively and efficiently, and that closure is attained on recommendations resulting from these activities.  The PM/PDM incorporates inspection plans designed to \"enhance safety, environmental integrity, operational reliability, and protection for plant personnel and the surrounding community\".\n\n\n\nSyngenta also conducts extensive employee training.  Some of this training is done via a web-based computer aided training system, Intelex, which allows on demand traini"

The Intelex Training module electronically records this training.\n\n \n\n (d) The five-year accident history;\n\n\n\nWithin the past 5 years (May 2016 through May 2021), Syngenta has had no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.                                                                                                         \n\n\n\n(e) The emergency response program;\n\n\n\nSyngenta is a very proactive participant of the local Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) committee as well as having close involvement and interaction with the Iberville Parish Emergency Preparedness agency (the local LEPC).  The facility is part of the community emergency response plan and has a facility emergency response plan.  Both plans include specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Syngenta, in conjunction with the LEPC, has several mechanisms in place to notify the surrounding community including an automated dial-up phone system, activation of a televised public announcement and a strategically placed community siren system.  Syngenta also has on-site first aid and emergency medical responders, a hazmat team as well as emergency response equipment including a fire truck and ambulance.\n\n\n\n(f) Administrative programs to improve safety.\n\n\n\nThe site has developed and implemented an Incident Management System which enhances the ease of reporting, completing root cause analysis, tracking associated actions, and trending and communicating data. This data management tool is also utilized to document Management of Change (MOC), and HSE Audit systems.  Additionally, a position of Technical Training Coordinator exists to enhance training systems with site emphasis placed on early development of new Tech"
