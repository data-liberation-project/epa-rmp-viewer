If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility information:\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application as a crop nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 80,000 pounds of ammonia in our single 15,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios:\nThe toxic worst-case scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of our storage tanks released as a gas over ten (10) minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 80,000 pounds, representing the volume of all our storage tanks. Based on the DEGADIS model, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 2.13 miles. There are residences in this range with a  total population of 200.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\nThe toxic alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the most likely incident is a 26,638 pound release from a break in a transfer hose. Based on the DEGADIS model, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.56 miles. There are residences in this range with a total population of 175.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs:\nOur facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,\" K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111; \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\" This facility also complies with the EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local regula"

A written emergency response program is in place, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training. We have discussed this policy with our local fire department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at our facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. At this time, there are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation."
