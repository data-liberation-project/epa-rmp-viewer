The Edinburg Water Filtration Plant lost power and the newly constructed West Edinburg Water Treatment Plant began producing treated water. The West Edinburg Water Treatment Plant policy approach to accidental release prevention integrates technology, procedures, and good management practices. The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each of its facilities and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and complies with USEPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nAntonio Leal, Water Plant Superintendent, is the responsible official at the Edinburg West Edinburg Water Treatment Plant. The plant operates on property just west of the Edinburg water storage reservoirs at 1752 South Mon Mack Road, Edinburg, Hidalgo County, Texas. Its chlorination building sits on the east side of the plant and consists of an enclosed room that houses nine (9), 1-ton Chlorine cylinders. The chlorine room is equipped wi"

The facility houses emergency air and power supply. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) storage occupies a location at the entrance to the chlorine building, approximately 50 feet from the chlorination room.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the West Edinburg Water Treatment Plant includes consideration of two release scenarios for each parameter of concern (chlorine): \n1. A Worst-Case Release\n2. An Alternative Scenario\nThe EPA guidelines define AWorst-Case Release@ resulting from an unspecified failure in which, AThe owner-operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes.@ The same guidelines define an AAlternative Scenario@ as, AMore likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.@\n\nPerformance of atmospheric dispersion modeling determines the distance traveled by a parameter of concern before its concentration decreases to the Atoxic endpoint@. The EPA defines Atoxic endpoint@ as 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine. This value corresponds to the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines Level 2 (ERPG-2) concentrations, which the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) defines as:\n\nAThe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one-hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual?s ability to take protection action.@\n\nThe estimated population potentially affected by the release equals the residential population within the radius of a circle corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.\nThe following conditions define the Worst-Case Release Scenario at the Edinburg West Edinburg Water Treatment Plant:\n\n?
