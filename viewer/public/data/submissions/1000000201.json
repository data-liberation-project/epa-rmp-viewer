In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, A?establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators,A? however we are also engaged in providing A?agricultural inputsA? that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading Anhydrous Ammonia is #493130 farm product warehousing and storage.  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle Propane for both agricultural uses and home heating, which is under consideration as a listed substance.  We include Propane (as well as all crop protectants and petroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.  For approximately one week per year, Anhydrous Ammonia may be included in a process (T-Reactor) of blending to make a 10-34-0 starter grade l"

The maximum Quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is 552,000 Lbs.  The maximum on site vessel size is 30,000 Gallons, storing 131,325 Lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a rail tank car(ranging from 156,000 to 198,000 lbs.) or a  semi-trailer tank (ranging from 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.)\n\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  The office area is within a close proximity of the NH3 plant where a total of 4 full-time employees work year-round.\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 A?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)standard 29CFR 1910.111 A?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.A?  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, Breakaway couplers at risers, Emergency shut-off valves, Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.  We have developed an Emergency Action Plan for employees, customers, and visitorA?s protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and other acts of god that initiates evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our company including the Anhydrous Ammonia facility included in this plan.
