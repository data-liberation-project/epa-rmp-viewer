              "Description": "CSM Bakery Products is a Bakery/Cold storage facility. This facility falls under the NAICS code 424420. Our safety information was last reviewed and updated August 11, 2011 (Safety meetings are conducted every month). We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association, American National Standards Institute, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers standards. These standards, and all applicable OSHA standards have been implemented here through written manuals by Environmental Services Group, Inc. The most recent hazard review and update conducted at this facility was October 28, 2013, and corrections/recommendations were completed by November 30, 2013. The main hazard identified during this hazard analysis was the necessity of additional review of maintenance procedures for identification/detection of releases in all areas where a release could occur. To prevent /limit releases, this facility uses vents, relief valves, check valves, manual valve shutoffs, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, emergency power backup, and grounding equipment. Operating and training procedures were reviewed and revised on December 23, 2013 and January 18, 2013, respectively. The employees of CSM Bakery Products are trained in the classroom and by on-the-job training. This training is completed with competency test including demonstration, and observation. The maintenance procedures are reviewed by operators on a regularly basis to ensure proper operation of the refrigeration system. The last time they were reviewed and written out was April 30, 2013 after the system was updated. CSM Bakery Products contracted Environmental Services,Group, Inc., which triggered a review of our safety information, operating and maintenance procedures and training.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe CSM Bakery Solutions Facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and action procedures.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nCSM Bakery Solutions located on Miller Road in Dallas, TX, is a bakery and cold storage facility. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling.  In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, CSM Bakery Solutions has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\n\n\n\n3.    Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the CSM Bakery Solutions  facility.\n\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nThe Dallas TX, - Miller Road Facility has an emergency plan that addresses the actions necessary in the event of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor room is provided with ammonia detectors and visual alarms. The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, refrigeration system operators and contractors have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.    In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Dallas Fire Department and the"
