This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system that uses a real time database to track inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\n\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Kendallville facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as with the Kendallville Fire Department and the Kendallville HAZMAT Duty Officer in the event of an emergency. Additionally the HAZMAT Duty Office remits an annual letter to the Kendallville facility confirming the HAZMAT obligations.\n\n\n\nProcess Description and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Kendallville plant produces marshmallows and caramel products. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311999.\n\n\n\nThe Kendallville plant has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as discussed in the following text.\n\n\n\nAlthough there are quality and safety systems in place at the Kendallville plant, a release from the ammonia system could potentially affect employees on-site and the general public offsite.

If a release occurred however, the alternative scenario would be more likely. The release scenario distance to endpoint was determined by using the US EPA RMP*Comp program and is on file at the Kendallville facility. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file at the Kraft Kendallville facility. Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW VI mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2000 data.\n\n \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Kendallville plant has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.   The Kendallville facility?s ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined that it meets the requirements established in the RM program guidelines.  \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nAccording to the requirements established for listing an accidental release as set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases of ammonia at this facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Kendallville Plant has developed an emergency response program, which is comprised of three elements: emergency communications, emergency evacuation procedures and an off-site plan. The emergency communications document is written to establish procedures to notify appropriate agencies (like the Kendallville Fire Department, and local Kendallville HAZMAT team) and internal emergency management team members in the event of an emergency.

The off-site plan identifies the hazardous and flammable chemicals on-site (and the quantities), the primary emergency responders site diagrams, support available at/from the facility as well as a hazard analysis (off-site consequences and affected area, including receptors).\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Kendallville facility is currently in the process of completing an ammonia system upgrade and will continue to periodically review all opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel as well as the ammonia refrigeration process."
