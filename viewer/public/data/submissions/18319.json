      "SummaryText": "SAFETY POLICY STATEMENT\nIt is the policy of Davis Gas Processing that accident prevention shall be considered of primary importance in all phases of operation and administration. It is the intention of Davis Gas Processing management to provide safe and healthy working conditions and to establish and insist upon safe practices at all times by all employees. The prevention of accidents is an objective affecting all levels of our company and its operations. It is, therefore, a basic requirement that each supervisor make the safety of all employees an integral part of his or her regular management function. It is equally the duty of each employee to accept and follow established safety regulations and procedures. Every effort will be made to provide adequate training to employees. Employees are expected to assist management in accident prevention activities. Unsafe conditions must be reported immediately. Safety is everyones business.\n\nSITE DESCRIPTION\nThe Pearsall DGP Plant is located at 5858 FM 1582, which is 7 miles SE of Pearsall, Tx. On FM 1582.\nThere is a Natural Gas Liquids Storage Tank, which is a 200 barrel painted, welded steel, above ground, horizontal pressure vessel. The  tank is protected by a pressure relief valve. Liquid flow into this tank is determined by the process operations. Liquid flow out of this tank goes to tank truck loading and is manually controlled. Operating personnel on a daily basis visually inspect this tank. If a spill occurred at this tank, the contents are so volatile that they would evaporate before penetrating the ground to any significant degree. \n\nPURPOSE AND GOALS FOR THE PEARSALL DGP PLANT\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE AND ACTION PLAN\nEmergency Response And Action Plans (ERAP) were developed by Davis Gas Processing  for its Pearsall DGP Plant located in Frio County, Texas.  The ERAP was developed to assist the Pearsall DGP Plant Foreman in his responsibility to provide skilled and compliant emergency leadership in the event of emergency"

To provide Pearsall DGP Plant employees with emergency prevention training that will allow them to avoid process emergencies by predicting and recognizing potentially hazardous situations.\n    2.    To provide Pearsall DGP Plant employees with emergency prevention training that will allow them to recognize and assess the consequences of personal actions when working  with equipment containing pressurized,  very cold, highly volatile,  and flammable substances.\n    3.    To assure that Pearsall DGP Plant  employees will respond in a safe, prompt, and compliant fashion in the event of unintentional releases of hazardous chemicals in and from the Pearsall DGP Plant.\n    4.    To guarantee that all Pearsall DGP Plant visitors  will be effectively warned to recognize, avoid, and to escape hazardous situations and guarantee that they will be accounted for and removed from the Pearsall DGP Plant in the event of a site emergency.\n    5.    To document that Pearsall DGP Plant emergency response efforts were effective,  prompt,  and  professional.\n    6.    To document that Pearsall DGP Plant emergency response training is provided periodically and in a clear and consistent manner, and to ensure  Pearsall DGP Plant  employees have a basic working knowledge of Pearsall DGP Plant emergency response procedures.\n    7.    To document that Pearsall DGP Plant  employees have a clear understanding of the recommended responses for various possible emergency scenarios.\nThe Emergency Response Program that we have in place details emergency escape procedures and route assignments that have been posted in work area, and all employees have been trained by supervisors in the correct procedures to follow. New and change in status employees have been trained when assigned to perform any duties that involve the handling of hazardous chemicals.  This facility has an Emergency Shut-Down Procedure that describes the steps to be taken in order for no"

The Foreman is responsible for accounting for all employees, personally or through a designee, by having all employees report to predetermined, designated rally point and conducting  a head count. Rescue and medical duties will be performed by EMS personnel from the Pearsall, Texas Fire Department. The employees of the facility will be notified by verbal notification if  an evacuation is necessary.  All personnel have been trained in the safe and orderly emergency evacuation of the premises. The training includes, but is not limited to, the Emergency Shut-Down Procedures, escape routes, exits, and rally points. Training was and/or will be provided for employees when:\n1.

Employees are hired or transferred.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO \n The worst-case scenario would involve some sort of mechanical object (e.g. plane, vehicle) to hit or rupture the storage tank of  the  Natural Gas Liquids Tank.\nThe Natural Gas Liquid Tanks contains 34,500 lbs. of flammable substance with a worst-case scenario radius of exposure of  1,584 feet. There are no houses or public facilities in the radius of exposure. \n.\nThis facility  has  had no accidents in the last 5 years involving a regulated chemical, that has involved death, injury, or emergency response. Our facility has procedures coordinated with the local response agencies encase of  an accidental release.\nThis facility follows the rules and regulations of  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental Protection Agency(EPA),  and the Texas Railroad Commission(TNRCC).This facility has labeled all their storage tanks with identifying signs and NFPA labels which enable the fire department easy identification of the products health, flammability, and reactivity.
