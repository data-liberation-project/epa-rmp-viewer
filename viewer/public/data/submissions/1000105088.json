This is the official Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for the Z-Star facility and supersedes previous plans and is intended to prevent Team Member actions which are not in accordance with the intent of this plan.\n\nWith respect to fires, the Z-Star site does not have a fire brigade and is therefore dependent upon the local Fire Department for response to fires that escalate beyond incipient phase.  Properly trained employees can respond to incipient fires requiring one fire extinguisher after notifying the local Fire Department.  The Z-Star site will work closely with the local Fire Department to prevent fires from occurring and to quickly mitigate fires should they occur.  \nThe Z-Star Emergency Response Plan (RNG-ALL-P2020-A Emergency Response) [16], will be reviewed to ensure that it remains accurate and current. Zwemmer Z-Star RNG, LLC Team Members are trained on the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan when initially hired, when the plan is revised, and when the Team Member\u0092s responsibilities are changed.  All Zwemmer Z-Star RNG, LLC Team Members will receive annual refresher training on the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan.  In addition, contractors are trained on the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan such that they understand alarms providing notification of potential emergency situations, how to appropriately respond to such situations, evacuation routes, and muster site locations.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nStudies associated with prevention program elements such as PHAs, incident investigation, management of change, and compliance audits are regularly conducted at the Z-Star Site to verify designs and to identify potential hazards.  Recommendations may be developed as a result of these studies and as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions.

The Contractor Safety Standard establishes minimum criteria for contractor Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) management and provides guidance to Team Members who manage contractors to ensure safe completion of contracted work.\n\nThis standard applies to contractors performing work or seeking approval to perform work for Zwemmer Z-Star RNG, LLC.  Vendors and other companies providing incidental services that do not influence processes or process equipment safety such as printer supply and servicing, vending machine supply and servicing, etc. are exempted from most of the requirements of this standard, except for orientation. Delivery and pick-up companies (e.g., UPS, FedEx, DHS, etc.) that provide delivery and pick-up services to a Zwemmer Z-Star RNG, LLC owned or leased site are not included in the scope of this contractor standard.\n\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\nThe Commercial Plant that is being constructed at the Z-Star site is a new installation. As such there is no five-year accident history.  \n\n1.5 Emergency Response Program\nOverall safety at the Z-Star site is governed not only by the ability to prevent accidental releases, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases.

These requirements include the development of written procedures to prevent fires resulting from any temporary operation involving open flames or producing heat and/or sparks.  Hot Work activities include, but are not limited to welding, burning, grinding, chipping, brazing, soldering, thawing pipes, sand blasting, metal-on-metal contact or metal-on-concrete, internal combustion engines and other potentially spark producing equipment or activities, including static electrical discharges.  A Hot Work Permit is required when such work is to be performed outside of designated hot work areas and for operation of non-rated mobile equipment, power tools, spark or heat producing tools/equipment, and the use of battery powered devices in classified areas at the Z-Star site.

Comparing satellite imagery of area from 2010 to most recent satellite imagery of area from 2022  shows that there were minimal additional residential developments near the facility. Since the residential developments appear to be minor and no other sensitive receptors were added to this area, using the default 2010 census data provided by MARPLOT instead of the 2020 census data does not significantly affect the estimates for the impacted population. \n\nFlammable Worst-Case Scenario\nOne worst-case scenario (WCS) was developed for the Z-Star facility, as methane is present over the threshold quantities. \nThe WCS was a vapor cloud explosion from an instantaneous release of the total contents of a single tanker storage vessel containing 22,000 lbs of methane. Although there are numerous installed control measures that, in an actual event, should prevent or mitigate the release, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario.  The endpoint distance results for this WCS were generated by EPA\u0092s RMP*Comp program. The maximum estimated distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure was 0.2 miles.

To minimize the potential for fire should methane leakage occur, flammable gas detectors have been located throughout process operations at Z-Star.  These flammable gas detectors have been equipped with alarms to the control room as well as local audible and visual alarms set at 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) to provide notification well before leakage reaches the flammable/explosive range.
