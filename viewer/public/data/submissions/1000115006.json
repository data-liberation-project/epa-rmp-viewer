These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nIncident investigations are conducted for any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of the regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident (root case analysis) as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Incident investigations start promptly and no later than 48 hours after the event.  All reports are retained for a minimum five (5) years.\n\nThe Sims Bayou Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses reviews.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nSims Bayou Plant has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and a medical treatment, evacuations, and notifications of local emergency response agencies and the public. The facility's emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced to ensure it operates properly.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within Sims Bayou Plant's processes that would require a modified emergency response."

Training ensures employees have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including emergency response, as provided in the written operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to employees working with or operating the chlorination system and equipment.  This helps to ensure that the employees understand and adhere to the current operating procedures.\n\nMaintenance\n\nWritten maintenance procedures have been assembled.  Maintenance checks on process equipment are conducted and documented to ensure proper operations of the chlorination system.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, overhead cranes  and other chlorination related equipment.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, terminology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by modifications in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at Sims Bayou Plant.

The following sections briefly described the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the facility.\n\nSafety Information\n\nComprehensive chemical data has been assembled.  Operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes along with Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are onsite.  Health hazards, chemical exposure limitations and physical properties of chlorine are included in the complied data.  This information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nHazard Analysis\n\nComprehensive process hazard analysis reviews are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with the facility's processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these reviews is inspection of the plant to identify deficiencies throughout the system.  The reviews are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations and safety.  Hazard analysis reviews are revalidated routinely and any findings related to the hazards analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures that provide instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to the chlorination process have been assembled.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as container connection and change-outs, startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.

This water treatment plant uses chlorine to disinfect public drinking water to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  The Sims Bayou Plant uses and stores a chemical subjected to the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) program rules and regulations. \n \nSims Bayou Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at its facility.  The design of the chlorination system supports the risk management programs goals and objectives.  New  equipment, processes and equipment are evaluated in our quest to improve safety and reduce or eliminate the use of chlorine gas at the plant.  No changes in the process management are currently anticipated. \n \nRegulated Substance\n\nThere is one regulated chemical at the facility; chlorine. The maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility is 8,000 pounds. Chlorine containers and equipment, except the chlorine scrubber, are housed inside the chlorine building.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidental releases involving chlorine that resulted in any offsite impacts.  There have been no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nEmployees, supervisors and managers are responsible for complying with the RMP regulations. It is policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. In the event of a release, trained personnel with the Houston Fire Department's HazMat team and the vendor/manufacturer supplying this facility with chlorine respond t"
