Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is Blue Racer's policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Berne Plant has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. \n\nNo regulated toxic chemicals (listed in 40 CFR ?68.130) are handled in the Berne Plant.  The plant handles flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating.  Safety precautions are in place when handling flammable mixtures to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health and safety of personnel, contractors, the community and the environment.  \n\nThe Berne Plant Emergency Response Plan (ERP) defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The ERP includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release.  All employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures.  The ERP also includes procedures for notifying facility personnel, emergency response personnel, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Lewisville and Woodsfield Volunteer Fire Departments.  \n\n\n\nB.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Berne Plant process natural gas received via pipeline and consists of two trains with a cryogenic processing capacity of 400 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD). The gas is dehydrated and processed to remove heavy (liquid) hydrocarbons from the gas stream. The cryogenic unit is designed to liquefy natural gas liquids (NGL) from the dehydrated inlet gas by removing heat fro"

The NGL and condensates are flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nC.    The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios\n\na.    Worst Case scenario:\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumes that the vessel with the largest amount of NGL had a catastrophic failure. The flammable material is composed of a mixture that contains the following regulated substances: ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane. It is assumed that the mixture is composed entirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage (i.e. highest heat of combustion) in this case ethane.\n\nThe entire weight of the mixture is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. The scenario involved a release of 232,952 lb.  RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.5 miles to the 1 psi endpoint, wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, stability class F with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F).  \n\nb.    Alternative Case scenario:\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumed that the vessel with the largest amount of natural gas liquids (NGL) had a small leak (1.5 inch hole) resulting in a vapor cloud fire. The alternative scenario is calculated using the chemical with the lowest lower flammability limit (LFL).  The LFL for butane, ethane and propane is 36 mg/L, and pentane has a LFL of 38 mg/L. Thus ethane was the chemical used in the analysis for the distance to the LFL limit.\n\nRMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.1 miles to endpoint, wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F).  Since the scenario does not produce an offsite impact, no adverse impact to the public or to the environment is expected from this rel"

General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Berne Plant is a PSM-covered facility and, as such, it has a viable process safety program. Workers and their representatives are consulted and have access to information regarding all PSM elements. Complete and accurate information on the process technology, process equipment, and hazardous characteristics and physical properties of all chemicals and intermediates for all covered processes is maintained. \n\nProcess Hazards Analyses were conducted on the process to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Major hazards identified include fire, explosion, over-pressurization, overfilling, and equipment failure.  Process controls in place include relief valves, check valves, emergency and automatic shutdowns, grounding, interlocks and procedures and training. \n\nTrainings (initial and refresher) are conducted and includes on-the-job and classroom type training.  Testing (oral and written) and demonstration are used as means to verify understanding.  \n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide clear written instructions for conducting activities safely. SOPs address operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. SOPs are revised as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n \n\nA mechanical integrity program is in place that conducts training, develop written procedures, perform inspections and tests, correct deficiencies and apply quality assurance measures.

The MOC program outlines approval responsibilities and requires hazard evaluations prior to the implementation of any changes affecting a covered process.  Affected personnel and contractors are trained in the changes before they startup.  \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) conducted by appropriate employees, as spelled out in the facility's PSSR procedure. \n\nThe facility has an active accident/incident prevention program.  Each incident and near miss associated with the process area is evaluated and, if it meets pre-defined criteria, a team-based investigation is performed.  The investigation's purpose is to identify root and contributing causes and to make recommendations to prevent future recurrence.  The facility's safety manager tracks investigation action items through until closure.\n\nEmployees are active in all aspects of process safety, including safe work permitting, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, mechanical integrity and management of change.  \n\nAdditionally, contractors are involved in many aspects of the programs.  \n\nBlue Racer screens contractors based on safety performance before they are allowed entrance to the facility.
