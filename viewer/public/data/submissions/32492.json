Through our policies, procedures and actions, our goal is to prevent accidents and chemical releases. Sentry Industries maintains our facility in accordance with all local, state, and federal requirements. Sentry Industries is an active member in the Chlorine Institute and follows the recommendations for the safe handling of chlorine. Sentry Industries is also a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) District 11.\n\nSentry Industries manufactures and distributes swimming pool supplies to wholesalers and service companies throughout South Florida. Sentry Industries manufactures sodium hypochlorite (bleach), along with other goods and services, which is used to sanitize private and public swimming pools and in the sanitization of drinking water and wastewater treatment.  \n\nSentry Industries Risk Management Plan encompasses the following written procedures:\n\n1. Standard Operating Procedures \n2. Preventative Maintenance Procedures \n3. Operator Training Programs\n4. Safety Manual\n5. Chemical Accident Prevention Plan\n6. Site Emergency Response Plan\n7. Accident Investigation Procedures\n8. Fleet Safety Manual\n9. Site Security Program\n\nIn the manufacturing process of sodium hypochlorite bleach, elemental chlorine is used, which is a regulated substance under both EPA's Risk Management Plan rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Materials rule. \n\nSentry Industries has taken the following steps to ensure our safe handling of chlorine in the community:\n\n?* ?State of the art valve closure system to close the valves on the railcar and the process piping system in case of railcar movement, detection of chlorine released to the atmosphere, safety equipment failure, loss of utilities including ele"
