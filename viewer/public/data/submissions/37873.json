Trent Tube is committed to ensuring that HF is stored and handled in a safe manner.  We have conducted hazard reviews of the HF process to ensure that our installations are in compliance with Federal, state and local codes, standards, and generally accepted good engineering practice and reviewed maintenance and operating procedures to enhance safety.  Employees and contractors who are involved in storing and handling HF have been trained in safe storage and handling procedures.\n\nIn case of an accidental release of HF, it is Trent Tube's policy to notify the LEPC of East Troy, and Onyx so that they can respond to the emergency.  Trent Tube has procedures in place to notify the appropriate emergency services in case of an accidental release.\n\nFACILTIY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe primary purpose of Trent Tube's East Troy, Wisconsin facilities is to manufacture stainless steel tube of varying diameters and lengths.  Stainless steel sheet stock is formed, rolled and welding into tubing.  In order to pickle the finished tube, lengths of tubing are dipped into a solution of HF (2-5%), Nitric Acid and water.  After pickling, the tubing is inspected, rinsed and bundled for shipping.  There are two HF (70% by weight) storage tanks at two different locations within the site.  The Plant 3 (Energy Drive) HF storage tank is 6,300 gallons in capacity and is located outsite the south-west corner of the building.  The Plant 2 HF tank is 6,300 gallons in capacity and is located outside the south-west corner of the building.  Both buildings are on contiguous properties and are considered a single source.\n\nThe RMP regulated substance at te East Troy, Wisconsin facility is Hydrofluoric Acid (70% by weight).\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND C"

The HF equipment was installed according to guidelines provided by the Hydrogen Fluoride Industry Practices Institute.  HF delivery hoses are wire reinforced, inspected before and after each use and replaced annually.  Both HF storage tanks have been thickness tested.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe Trent Tube, East Troy, Wisconsin site has not experienced a release of Hydrofluoic Acid in the last five years that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving hydrofluoric acid, it is Trent Tube's policy to notify the HAZMAT Team, the National Response Center (LEPC), Emergency Services, and out designated spill response contractor, Onyx Environmental Services, Inc., and let them respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Emergency Services.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nNone at this time."
