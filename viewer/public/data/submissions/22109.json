It has in place at this time an extensive environmental health and safety\ncompliance program which addresses all Federal, State and local laws and regulations applicable\nto the facility including an effective RMP for Hydrazine (64%).\nFairmount is a specialty chemicals manufacturer located at 117 Blanchard Street, Newark, NJ which employs approximately fifty employees.  Like many other companies in the area, Fairmount receives, stores, uses and ships some hazardous chemical.  the chemicals at Fairmount include Hydrazine (64%), an EPA regulated toxic substance.  Fairmount receives, stores, blends and re-packages this chemical (but does not produce the chemical at this site).  An extensive accidental release prevention and risk management plan has been carefully developed and implemented to ensure the safety and health of all persons in the community in the unlikely case of an explosion, fire or other emergency. This includes a management system, hazard assessment, safety information, operating procedures, training, preventive maintenance, emergency response procedures, prevention programs, passive and active mitigation systems and many other related programs and procedures.\n\nThe worst case chemical release scenario the law requires Fairmount to examine is a  rupture of\nthe main Hydrazine Storage Tank (ST-15t) which may contain up to 3,500 gals of Hydrazine (64%) at any one time. Fairmount has in place a properly designed and maintained spill dike\nwith provisions for enclosure to prevent any hydrazine liquid or fumes from escaping offsite. \nThe enclosure currently includes an emergency tarp covering, which is planned to be replaced by\na"

The nationally recognized first response guide #153 designated applicable to\nHydrazine (64%) would be utilized (if needed) for the worst case or any other alternative release\nscenario.\n\nWritten operating procedures prevent more than 8,500 gals. of Hydrazine (64%) from being\npresent in the 10,000 gal. tank.\n\nAn alternative chemical release scenario required by law to be considered is a transfer hose\nfailure while unloading hydrazine from the delivery truck. A Fairmount employee is continuously\npresent during the written unloading procedure. He could close the proper valve within one\nminute, limiting the release to 80 lbs. Such a small release would not result in Hydrazine (64%)\nliquid or fumes escaping offsite.\n\nThe RMP* Comp Model, NASA Publications on Hydrazine, the National Institute of\nOccupational Safety and Health Publications on Hydrazine, the U.S. Census Bureau Intranet Site,\nResponsible Care Recommendations from Manufacturers, the National Safety Council\nEnvironment Writer on Hydrazine and the National First Responders Guidebook were used in\ndeveloping toxic endpoint information during the initial phases of investigation for this RMP.\nThe initial worst case and alternative release models were later modified with proprietary\ninformation including passive mitigation, active mitigation and administrative controls.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the facility involving Hydrazine liquids or fumes in\nthe past five years.\n\nFairmount has a thorough followup system including updates, inspections, retraining, incident\naudits, etc. to ensure the continued effectiveness of this Risk Management plan and the continued\nsafet"
