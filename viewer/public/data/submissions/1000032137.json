However the 18,000 gal tank was previously in Propylene service.  Due to similarities of the properties of Propane and Propylene, there are no new impacts to health and safety.    PSM/RMP deliverables will be revised without revalidating the PHA.\n\nPropylene storage volume is decreasing to 2,000 gal (2 x 1000 gal tanks) from an 18,000 gal tank.   Due to storage volume reduction there are no new impacts to health and safety.  Due to volume of Propylene in a single process dropping below the 10,000 lb threshold, Propylene will be removed from the RMP program.\n\n\n\nOriginal PHA Report below:\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee participation, RMP related deliverables, and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nPropane and Propylene are the regulated substances that are managed at the Airgas - Mid America fill plant in Poca, WV.   Airgas - Mid America trucks pick up returned (empty) propane and propylene cylinders from customer locations and transport the returned cylinders to the stationary source.  Propane is stored at the stationary source in four small, interconnected bulk tanks.  Propylene is stored at the stationary source in a large bulk tank.  Propane and Propylene are transferred from the bulk tanks into propane and propylene cylinders, respectively.  The full propane and propylene cylinders are distributed by Airgas - Mid America to customers.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.

In addition, an accidental release had not lead to a response or restoration activity for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 222 for additional information or if applicable, updated information.\n\n\n\nEmployees of the stationary source will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The stationary source has an evacuation plan and has coordinated emergency response activities with local emergency responders.  Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 228 and Appendix Tab 312 for additional information.\n\n\n\nImplementation of the RMP processes produced many changes that improved safety.  Please refer to the PSM/RMP Corrective Action/Improvement Log for additional information.  At the time this Executive Summary was written, there were no additional plans for improvement.  Future improvements will be summarized on the PSM/RMP Corrective Action/Improvement Log.\n\n"
