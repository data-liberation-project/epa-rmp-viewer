This butane railcar storage and transloading system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions. Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\r\n\r\nPetersburg Terminal maintains an Emergency Action Plan and has been designated a \"non-responding\" facility\". As such, in the event of an emergency involving the Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading process, it is the policy of the Facility to evacuate personnel and contact the Petersburg Department of Fire, Rescue, and Emergency Services to request their assistance. Facility personnel have received emergency response training and all contractors and visitors are briefed on appropriate emergency actions prior to being permitted onsite.\r\n\r\nPetersburg Terminal has coordinated their Emergency Action Plan with the Petersburg Department of Fire, Rescue, and Emergency Services, the Office of the Fire Marshall, and the City of Petersburg LEPC. In addition, representatives from the Petersburg Department of Fire, Rescue, and Emergency Services have attended onsite orientation/training.\r\n\r\nPetersburg Terminal does not currently have any full-time or part-time Lincoln personnel on-site and is instead staffed entirely by contract personnel.
