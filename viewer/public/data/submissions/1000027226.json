      "SummaryText": "The Link Snacks facility, located in Alpena, South Dakota processes raw beef, pork, poultry, and other food ingredients into food products for distribution to retailers.  This plant has a closed loop refrigeration system containing ammonia for maintaining cooler temperatures for the handling and storage of the products. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is the only covered chemical at the plant used to refrigerate rooms to maintain a correct temperature as required by the food products being prepared and stored.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the plant refrigeration system, providing the means to maintain specified temperature and / or remove heat from the products being handled.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the plant and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from rooms within the facility.\n\n\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this plant.  \n\n\n\nThe plant underwent an expansion of the existing ammonia refrigeration process in 2012.  This new system will result in the process containing more that 10,000 pound of ammonia and therefore an OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Plan has been implemented.  It is the intent of this facility to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  \n\n\n\nThe plant ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using various methods such as on the job training and contractor explanation and training (contractors are members of IIAR).  This program consi"

Employees are initially trained and have refresher training in the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system and in the future will receive refresher training at least every three years.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is computer operated with on-site and remote access for control of the system.  The plant is typically staffed 24/7 and therefore can respond to any system alarms.  An ammonia detection system within the compressor room is in place which alarms if ammonia is sensed.  The ammonia refrigeration system is also protected by specific safety systems/hardware and safety cutouts including pressure, temperature and level control.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge and vessels from the hazards associated with overpressure.  \n\n\n\nThe process has numerous safe guards including:  \n\n?    Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\n?    Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \n\n?    The plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n\n?    A process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted in 2017.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents (none reportable); (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\n?

For plant projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\n?    Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\n?    The plant has a program for replacement of all pressure relief valves every five years.\n\n \n\nThe plant has an emergency response program based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency action plan includes, procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The plant emergency action plan is based on known applicable regulations and requirements.\n\n\n\nThe plant has had no reportable RMP type releases in the past five year history and furthermore in the 12 year history of the plant operation there has been no reportable releases. \n\n\n\nIdentification of opportunities and changes to improve safety is part of the culture of this plant. In addition to the plant programs mentioned above, the following changes are planned.\n\nReplacement evaporators in parts of the plant with upgrade to stainless steel coils. \n\n\n\n"
