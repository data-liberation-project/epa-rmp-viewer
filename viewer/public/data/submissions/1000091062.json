The NAICS number for the 283-W Facility is 22131, Water Supply and Irrigation Systems.\n\n\n\nThe 283-W Facility is located on the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site.  The 283-W Facility receives raw water from the Columbia River, treats (filters and disinfects) the raw water, and exports the treated water for process, fire protection, potable, and irrigation purposes in accordance with Washington Administrative Code, Chapter 246-290, Drinking Water Regulations.  One step of the treatment process is chlorination.  In the chlorination system, the 283-W Facility uses gaseous chlorine, stored at the facility in 1-ton chlorine containers, for injection into the raw, untreated facility influent and for disinfection of post-filtration effluent.  Chlorine is used as an algaecide and disinfectant.  Evaluation of the 283-W Facility and chlorine storage capacity indicates that the 283-W Facility stores or has the potential to store a chlorine inventory in excess of the threshold quantity (2,500 lb); therefore, the 283-W Facility is subject to Risk Management (RM) Program regulations.  \n\n\n\nThe 283-W Facility is subject to additional regulations related to the management of chemicals.  The 283-W Facility is subject to the reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act of 1986 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management Rule, which also contains provisions for the safe management of chemicals.

These regulations require periodic retesting of the containers to ensure container integrity. \n\n\n\nEach of the prime contractors for the U.S. Department of Energy Richland Operations Office have developed a similar approach to the management of chemicals that is consistent with the principles of integrated safety management.  The Hanford Chemical Management Program is used to evaluate the adequacy of individual project/facility chemical management programs, identify opportunities for improvement in the safe and efficient management of chemicals, implement changes to existing chemical management programs, develop chemical management systems, as appropriate, and control day-to-day management of chemicals on the Hanford Site. \n\n\n\nProcesses subject to the RM Program requirements are divided into three eligibility levels, referred to as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 is available to any process that has not had an accidental release with offsite consequences in the past 5 years and has no public receptors within the distance to the toxic endpoint associated with a worst-case scenario (WCS).  Processes subject to Program 1 must conduct and document a WCS, must coordinate emergency response activities with local responders, and must certify compliance as part of the RMP submission.  \n\n\n\nBased on this information, the 283-W Facility is a Program 1 process. \n\n\n\nProcesses subject to Program 1:\n\n\n\n Need not identify one WCS for all toxics and one alternative scenario for each toxic chemical/substance\n\n\n\n Need not identify one WCS and one alternative scenario for each flammable chemical \n\n\n\n Need not conduct a refined modeling analysis\n\n\n\n Need not develop an accident prevention program.\n\n \n\nToxic endpoints have been established in the RM Program guidance for chlorine.

The effected population was estimated at 914 people located within the effected area.  Because this area of the Hanford Site is not accessible to the public, no public receptors are within the WCS release area.  As a Program 1 process, no alternative release scenario was conducted as part of this RM Program.  However, alternative release scenarios were conducted during facility hazard assessments and analyses.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Hanford Site Environmental Report for Calendar Year 2002, Appendix G (PNNL 14295), there are no plants or mammals on the federal list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants within the WCS release area.  However, one bird (bald eagle) and two fish (spring run chinook salmon and steelhead) species are on the list of threatened and endangered species.  Furthermore, two species of plants (Umtanum desert buckwheat and White Bluffs bladderpod), one species of mammal (Washington ground squirrel), and one species of bird (western sage grouse) were candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  In addition, 11 species of plants and six species of birds were cited as being listed as either threatened or endangered by Washington State. \n\n\n\nA review of information from the Hanford Site Occurrence reporting system and discussions with 283-W Facility personnel reveals that there have been no known onsite or offsite deaths, injuries, significant property damage or offsite environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place for the last 5 years from the 283-W Facility. \n\n\n\nBecause the eligibility analysis concluded that the 283-W Facility is a Program 1 process, development of an accident prevention program is not required. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine system operations and maintenance are performed using pre-approved procedures.

The WTP is located in the East portion of the 200 Area, just outside the\n\neasternmost fence line of the 200 East Area, near the center of the Hanford Site. WTP is the cornerstone of DOE's mission to treat a portion of approximately 56 million gallons of chemical and radioactive waste contained in aging underground storage tanks located on the Hanford Site in Washington. The nuclear waste is the result of more than four decades of reactor operations and plutonium production for national defense. The aging storage infrastructure poses a threat to the\n\nenvironment. The solution to this problem is to safely and cost-effectively retrieve, process, and immobilize this waste so that it no longer poses an environmental concern. The DOE Office of River Protection (ORP) in Richland, Washington is responsible for the overall contract management and\n\ndirection of the activities necessary to remediate the Hanford tank waste.\n\nThe WTP Project involves designing, building, and commissioning a plant to immobilize a portion of an estimated 56 million gallons of chemical and radioactive waste stored in 177 aging underground tanks at DOE's Hanford Site near Richland, Washington. The waste was accumulated between 1944 and 1989, when the Hanford Site processed plutonium and other materials for nuclear defense. The WTP will vitrify the tank waste into a chemic"

The WTP treatment processes are designed to immobilize the waste constituents in a glass matrix by vitrification and to treat the offgas from the processes to a level that protects human health and the environment. To date there have been zero offsite chemical releases from the WTP.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is stored at WTP as a liquefied gas. Ammonia is transferred as a gas from the ammonia storage vessels for use within the facility. Offgas from the waste treatment process passes through a catalytic oxidizer/reducer skid housing a heat recovery unit, an electric heater, VOC catalyst, and SCR catalyst to remove volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide compounds in the offgas stream. The heat recovery exchange first raises the offgas temperature using the hot offgas from the catalyst beds. The electric heater is used to supplement the heat recovery exchange primarily during start-up and when operating with low NOx concentrations. The heated offgas is passed through the VOC catalyst to oxidize VOCs and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and water vapor. The offgas is then injected with a mixture of ammonia vapor and air from an ammonia/air dilution skid. Following ammonia injection, the offgas is passed through the SCR catalyst to reduce NOx to nitrogen and water vapor. The reduction reaction is exothermic, significantly increasing the offgas temperature. The outgoing hot offgas is cooled down in the heat exchanger and concurrently serves as the heating media for the incoming offgas. The cooled offgas stream is then directed to the Caustic Scrubber for acid gas removal and final cooling.\n\nThe Project implements and maintains procedures to respond promptly, efficiently, and effectively to emergencies involving WTP activities or operations at the construction site.
