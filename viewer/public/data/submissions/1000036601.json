This committment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our porocesses.  The objective of risk management and our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, CRRM's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nCRRM's Coffeyville Refinery (Refinery), located near Coffeyville, KS, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline, diesel fuels and coke) from crude oil.  Several regulated flammable substances and flammable mixtures and one toxic substance, hydrofluoric acid are contained in processes above threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nProcesses included in the plan are subject to the U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Porgram (RMP).  Some processes at the Refinery are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Refinery. This section addresses the following elements:   Process Safety Information, Process Hzard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Praticipation, Hot Work Permit and Contractors.  The accident prevention program at the Refinery equally covers all individually listed regulated substances, flammable mixtues, and toxic substance.  \n\n\n\nProcess "

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  This information addresses any known hazards associated with the use and handling of chemicals.  Safe operating limits and consequences of deviation have been established for processes.  The Refinery ensures that processes are maintained within these safe operating limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems).\n\n\n\nThe Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  These documents include materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identifi"

The refinery primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique to perform Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process evaluated.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls are consistent with the design safety features, the Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  Hazard reviews are also performed during the design stage of new facilities and for facilities undergoing significant modification. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n(1) initial startup;\n\n(2) normal operations;\n\n(3) temporary operations;\n\n(4) emergency shutdown;\n\n(5) emergency operations;\n\n(6) normal shutdown; and,\n\n(7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  \n\n\n\nThese procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can independently perform all job tasks of an Operator 3.  Operators will progress through subsequent job levels in the same manner.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: \n\n(1) conducting training;\n\n(2) developing written procedures;\n\n(3) performing inspections and tests;\n\n(4) correcting identified deficiencies; and,\n\n(5) applying quality assurance measures.  \n\n\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.

If a deficiency is identified, the deficiency will be corrected before placing the equipment back into service or the equipment use will be reviewed to determine necessary actions to ensure the continued safe operation of the euqipment.  \n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before implementation.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  \n\n\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.

The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion or toxic gas release that could lead to personal injury, severe environmental impact, or major property damage.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the cause(s) and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.
