A hazard review was conducted for hydrofluoric acid on January 6, 2017, and all identified potential problems are being addressed.  Written operating procedures for hydrofluoric acid storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with hydrofluoric acid or hydrofluoric acid-containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A preventive maintenance, inspection, and testing program is in place for hydrofluoric acid equipment and operations.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\nNo accidents involving hydrofluoric acid have occurred in the last five years.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nCleveland-Cliffs Steel Corporation - Butler Works has trained employees for emergency response and maintains an updated, written emergency response plan.  The plan is coordinated with Butler County (Pennsylvania) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local Fire Departments.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local fire department and outside emergency response personnel as needed.  Emergency responders, including employees and off-site emergency and fire personnel, have copies of the emergency response plan and are familiar with its use."

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCleveland-Cliffs Steel Corporation - Butler Works's Policy is to fully comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  This includes compliance with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).  \n\nThe Risk Management Plan, along with other safety and environmental programs already in-place, enables Butler Works to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of hydrofluoric acid, including leaks, spills, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\nButler Works's emergency response program is designed to provide rapid response to suspected problems to keep hazardous materials from being released into the environment, minimize the effects of any spills, and provide proper clean-up and required notifications as soon as possible following any incidents.\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\nCleveland-Cliffs Steel Corporation - Butler Works is a specialty steel manufacturing facility located on Route 8 South in Butler, Pennsylvania.  The facility is subject to the requirements of Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68) of the Clean Air Act due to on-site processes containing the regulated chemical, hydrofluoric acid, above the threshold quantities specified by the rules.\n\nHydrofluoric acid is stored and used at the facility's steel finishing operations.  It is stored as a 70% water solution in quantities greater than the 1,000-pound regulatory threshold and meets the criteria for a Program 2 process as specified in the RMP rules.\n\n3.  Chemical Accident Prevention Program\n\nCleveland-Cliffs Steel Corporation - Butler Works complies with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules for hydrofluoric acid solution.  All elements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Program requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for hydrofluoric acid.\n\nThe hydrofluoric acid system meets the requiremen"
