Both worst case and alternate case scenarios were modeled.  Modeling was performed using the EPA software program RMP*Comp (TM)\n\nThe worst case scenario is based on a catastrophic failure of the chlorine or sulfur dioxide holding tank due to corrosion, impacts, or structural failure.  The entire 2,000 pound tank capacity is assumed to disperse at a rate of 200 pounds per minute for a period of 10 minutes.\n\nThe modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine and sulfur dioxide under the worst case scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nChlorine - 1.3 miles\nSulfur dioxide - 1.3 miles\n\nThe modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine and sulfur dioxide under the alternate case scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nChlorine - 0.1 miles\nSulfur dioxide - 0.1 miles\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant Superintendent, John Lindstrom, is a qualified individual with overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the RMP.  He has the authority to commit resources required to implement the Risk Management Program. \nThe City of Pueblo Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed an RMP accident prevention program (including HAZOP studies for chlorine and sulfur dioxide) from the existing maintenance program and is in compliance with the RMP requirements for Program 2. \n\nThe City of Pueblo Wastewater Treatment Plant is a \u00c2\u00bfnon-responding facility\u00c2\u00bf and emergency responses permissible by City of Pueblo Waste Water Treatment Plant personnel are responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release.
