      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe County of San Luis Obispo?s Lopez Water Treatment Plant (LWTP) handles chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material. The properties of the material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility?s workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility?s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe chlorine gas is used to disinfect water at the LWTP. Chorine is delivered in one ton containers for use at the LWTP and to be stored at the LWTP for future use. All of the one ton containers are used at the location. The receipt, storage and handling of the chlorine are considered a single process in this RMP for the Federal ARP.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe one ton container is the largest vessel in the chlorine system at the LWTP. The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one ton container of chlorine assumes that the full 2,000 lbs of chlorine is released over an interval of 10 minutes resulting in a release rate of 200 lb/min. The distance to the end-point extends beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b. Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternate Release scenario for the chlorine is the release from the fuse plug inset  the lower area of the one ton container of chlorine. This results in the release of 1,813 lbs of chlorine over a period of 43 minutes. The distance to the end-point extends beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distance for each reported scenario exist to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a rele"

This administrative control is inherent in the operating procedures for the chlorine system and the training provided to the chlorine operators.\n\n3d. Mitigating Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to prevent a release from occurring. The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. \n\nThe facility complies with all applicable Federal and State codes and regulations. There are safety meetings and safety training. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represent one of the facility?s main active components to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of chlorine within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the fire department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated. The County of San Luis Obispo ? Environment Health can incorporate this response into the County Area plan for the Local Emergency Planning Committee. \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) program that are being implemented at this time for next year. Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve in"
