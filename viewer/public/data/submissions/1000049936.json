This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, Bronco Pipeline Company trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nBronco Pipeline Company Pony Station Description of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Bronco Pipeline Company Pony Station is a natural gas compressor station located in Watkins, CO. The plant is designed to remove any liquids from the incoming natural gas stream, re-introduce those down stream of gas measurement and compress the gas stream to be sent to sales. No liquids from the process are stored on the location.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps:\n\nThis facility was built in accordance with the appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants. Written programs and procedures cover all critical equipment and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\n\nChemical-specific steps Include:\n\n1. Hydrocarbon Detectors; Carbon Dioxide Detectors; Hydrogen Sulfide Detectors Acoustic Leak Detectors and Fire Detection Systems Eyes.\n\n2. Process Safety Relief Valves;\n\n3. Automated Plant Shutdown System. The plant will be automatically shut-down should key process parameters vary from specified ranges;\n\n4. Manual valves to permit isolation of various portions of the process;\n\n5. Appropriately placed portable fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires;\n\n5. 6. Back-up generator to keep c"
