      "SummaryText": "The Precise Packaging facility, located in Fall River, Massachusetts provides contract filling, compounding and package development services for home fragrance, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries.  Aerosol container filling services at the facility utilize a series of eight  Liquefied Petroleum (LP) Gas tanks ( seven 3,500-gallon tanks, and two 1,500-gallon tanks) that house a combination of 1,1 Diflouroethane (DFE), Propane and Isobutane (Aerosols).  These exterior tanks serve a series of four exterior gas houses.  The aerosols are circulated through the gas house(s) in liquid form and injected into partially-filled and sealed aerosol containers. Pressurized containers return to the facility, via conveyor systems, for inspection and packaging. At maximum, the facility may store (for brief time periods) approximately 185,000 small (1 to 5 ounce) bottles of finished product awaiting shipment to customers.  Finished product bottles contain varying amounts of aerosol.  \r\n\r\nAt any given time, the assumed combined maximum inventory of 1,1 DFE, Propane and Isobutane is approximately 130,000 pounds (present in tanks and finished product). 1,1 DFE, Propane and Isobutane are covered substances under the Risk Management Program, each with an applicability threshold of 10,000 pounds.  As such, the Precise Packaging facility is subject to the RMP requirements.  \r\n\r\nBased on the evaluation performed by ERM in conjunction with Precise Packaging personnel, it was determined that the facility is eligible for classification under the Program level 3 requirements.   A covered process is subject to Program 3 if the process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and does not meet the Program Level 1 eligibility conditions which, among other things, require that the facility must analyze the worst-case release scenario for the covered process(es) and document that the nearest public receptor is beyond the distance to a toxic or flammable en"

Among these halogenated compounds, hydrogen fluoride (HF) could be created.\r\n\r\nERM performed a review of typical by-products and/or decomposition products of DFE when released into the atmosphere.  Based on the data included in the Safety Data Sheet, DFE is a stable compound and does not readily react with water in the environment.  However, DFE is flammable and under a combustion scenario (i.e., explosion) DFE will decompose to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, halogenated compounds, and/or carbonyl halides.  Among these halogenated compounds, hydrogen fluoride (HF) could be created.\r\n\r\nFor RMP purposes, a worst case theoretical scenario regarding HF formation assumes that during an explosion the maximum DFE stored at the facility (62,500 pounds) is completely consumed and all halogenated compounds produced are HF.  Based on the molecular structure of DFE, C2H4F2, there are two fluorine atoms available for HF formation for every molecule of DFE.  Using the molecular weight of DFE (66.05 lb/lbmole), approximately 946.25 lbmoles of DFE is the maximum storage quantity on site.  If every fluorine atom were to convert to HF during an explosion (a 2:1 ratio), 18,925 lbmoles of HF would be produced.  Using the molecular weight of HF (20.01 lb/lbmole), this would equate to a maximum theoretical release of approximately 37,868.25 lbs HF.  This level would be above the identified action level thresholds with respect to HF exposure. \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of propellant from the facility in the past five years.  There have been no accidental releases of alcohol from the facility in the past five years.
