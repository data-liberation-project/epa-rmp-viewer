IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS LOCATION HAS 1 BULK STORAGE TANK AND 18 NURSE TANKS.  THIS FACILITY HAS THE CAPACITY TO STORE 158,000 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.THE STORAGE TANK IS LOCATED DIRECTLY SOUTH OF THE OFFICE. THE VALVES ARE LOCATED ON THE EAST END OF THE TANK. THE NURSE TANK  FILL STATION IS LOCATED DIRECTLY SOUTH OF THE STORAGE TANK. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A  RELEASE IN THE AMOUNT OF 79000 POUNDS. THE RELEASE WOULD BE 7900 POUNDS PER MINUTE FOR 10 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 1.5M/SEC. WIND SPEED THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE 3.2 MI. AFFECTING 672 PEOPLE. THE ALTERNATE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE. THE QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 11908 POUNDS AT A RATE OF 5954 POUNDS PER MINUTE. THE RELEASE DURATION WOULD BE 2 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 3M/SEC WIND SPEED THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE .5 MILE AFFECTING 9 PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IN EFFECT. THE FACILITY HAS BEEN REVIEWED FOR GENERAL COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\",PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. (ANSI), AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\". THE ANSI STANDARD HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY REFERENCE BY IOWA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE PART 21-CHAPTER 43-RULE 43.6(200): \"STANDARD FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\".

WE ALSO HAVE GAUGES TO TELL US WHEN THESE TANKS ARE FULL TO PREVENT THE OVER FILLING OF THESE TANKS WHICH IN TURN WOULD CREATE AN ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE. SAFETY IS AN ONGOING PROCESS.  WE INSPECT OUR PLANT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE REVIEW OUR SAFETY POLICIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INSTALLING BARRIERS TO HELP PREVENT VEHICULAR DAMAGE.  WE HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.  OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29 CFR 1910.38. WE ALSO FOLLOW THE IOWA FERTILIZER RULE STANDRDS AND PROVIDE STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT TO KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).
