THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A  RELEASE IN THE AMOUNT OF 79000 POUNDS. THE RELEASE WOULD BE 7900 POUNDS PER MINUTE FOR 10 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 1.5M/SEC. WIND SPEED THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE 3.2 MI. AFFECTING 672 PEOPLE. THE ALTERNATE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE. THE QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 11908 POUNDS AT A RATE OF 5954 POUNDS PER MINUTE. THE RELEASE DURATION WOULD BE 2 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 3M/SEC WIND SPEED THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE .5 MILE AFFECTING 9 PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IN EFFECT.
