The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the impact to Instinct employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be met by using good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities with the local emergency response providers. This plan covers all Instinct owned activities.\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Impact facility is a pet food processing and storage facility. Raw materials are trucked to the facility and then processed into various types of Instinct pet food products.\n\nThe refrigeration system is used for cooling and freezing capabilities required for the processing and storing of the food product. The cooling medium for refrigeration at this site is anhydrous ammonia (subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68) , which is used in a closed loop recirculating and recycling system.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n*\tEmployee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n*\tProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia SDS and a detailed description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n*\tProcess Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies using t"
