      "SummaryText": "TPC Group, LLC - Port Neches Operations (PNO) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies. The TPC Group Port Neches Operations (PNO Plant) is subject to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  As a result, the PNO Plant maintains an EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program under 29 CFR Part 1910 that focus on preventing the release of regulated substances and highly hazardous chemicals, and mitigating the consequences of any releases that occur.\r\n\r\nThe PNO Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious workplace for its associates and neighbors. The PNO Plant participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) Sabine-Neches Chiefs Association and the Port Neches Fire Department in assisting local officials in the development of emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with them. TPC Group participates in the Responsible Care initiative and is committed to the responsible management of chemicals. The PNO Plant Manager, or his designee, is responsible for implementation of the RMP.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled. The PNO Plant is located at the corner of Highway 136 and Highway 366 in Port Neches, Texas. The site began production in 1943 and was acquired by Huntsman in 1994 then TPC Group, LLC in 2007. The PNO Plant serves as a storage facility and terminal for volumes of Butadiene, Crude C4, and Raffinate. Butadiene is a PSM and RMP regulated substance, and is a monomer used in the production of butadiene rubber and various butadiene co-polymers.\r\n\r\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. \r\nThe PNO Plant developed and implements an RMP/PSM program appropriate to the complexities of its process - a storage and terminal facility for 1,3-butadiene.

      "SummaryText": "l elements contained in the RMP/PSM elements are important, key elements in our prevention efforts include process hazard analyses (PHA), mechanical integrity, and management of change.  \r\n\r\nPHAs are an exercise in which a team of subject matter experts identify and evaluate process hazards, and then make recommendations to control identified hazards. Mechanical integrity is the combination of inspections, testing, and preventive maintenance that is designed to prevent mechanical failures.  Management of Change is a rigorous process for reviewing the safety implications of any covered change proposed to the facility.  These key elements are supported by the remaining RMP/PSM elements, such as process safety information, operating procedures, training, to provide a comprehensive prevention program.\r\n\r\n4. 5 Year Accident History. The PNO Plant has had one accident, an explosion in November 2019 when the PNO Plant was processing butadiene, that meets the EPA criteria for the five-year accident history. Since that time, TPC has discontinued processing butadiene. However, the site continues to serve as a terminal for Crude C4, Raffinate and Butadiene.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program. TPC Group has a written emergency response program which encompasses the PNO Plant and contains procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a hazardous chemical. These procedures include steps for informing the public, proper first aid and medical treatment, the proper use of emergency equipment and emergency response training for emergency response employees who perform emergency response duties and local emergency responders who may be called to assist in emergency response. The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. Likewise, the emergency response equipment is maintained, tested and inspected periodically. TPC Group is actively involved with informing local officials about hazardous substances stored and processed on site. TPC Group"

The Safety Manager is the person to contact in the event of an emergency. The Emergency Response Coordinator for the plant is the designated alternate contact. Initial response will be provided by TPC Group on-site fire department.\r\n\r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety. The PNO Plant continues to upgrade fire water monitors and adding emergency block valves at various locations throughout the plant. There is an ongoing commitment to implement changes, when identified through HAZOP studies, employee suggestions, incident investigations, and other continuous improvement efforts that will improve the safety and protection of associates and neighbors from accidental releases of hazardous chemicals."
