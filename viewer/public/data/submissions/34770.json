As a result, accidental release prevention and emergency response policies have been instituted which include:operating and maintenance procedures, training and incident investigation, programs for handling chlorine, notification of key personnel during an emergency, immediately available SCBA and protective equipment to be used by trained personnel, an on-site emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event local emergency response is needed.  The worst-case release scenario as described in theis program is the release of the entire contents of a 1-ton liquid chlorine container in 10 minutes, or 200 lb./min.  Since all of the on-site containers are enclosed in a building the release rate has been reduced to 100 lb./min.  For the worst-case release scanario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec and an atmosperic stability class F was used.  Using a combination of local data and an approved modeling program, the distance to the Toxic Endppoint Limit (TEL) was determined to be 2.04 miles.The alternative-release scenario was based on a chlorine container isolation valve stem failure.  According to the Chlorine Institute this is the most common malfunction that results in a accidental release.  A release rate of 0.16 lb./min, a wind speed of 5.5 meters/sec. And atmospheric stability class D was used.  This data when modeled produced no off-site impacts.    The chlorine-specific accidental release prevention program in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporate operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves, enclosure of the chlorine supply and chlorination systems.  No Accidents have occurred in the last five years.  Procedures are in place identify and record any future accidents or incidents.  An On-Site Emergency Response Program, including an evac"
