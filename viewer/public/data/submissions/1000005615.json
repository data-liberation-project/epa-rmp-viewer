The management and employees of Effingham Clay Service Company are committed to prevention of accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. If any accidental release should occur. The facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.    The stationary source and the regulated substances handled. The primary activity at the facility which is located at 310 West North Water Street, Bethany  Illinois is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.

The accidental release prevention program. This facility complies withy EPAAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of AA?Safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute Inc.  As adopted by State regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR 1910.111, AA?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous AmmoniaAA?. Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n4.    Five year accident history. We had an accidental release of approx 72 pounds of anhydrous on 10/18/2007 as a result of an attempted theft of anhydrous for drug production. The local fire department responded and turned the valve off that was leaking a small amount of product.
