This could cause the contents of either a chlorine or sulfur dioxide vessel (2000 pounds) to be released outside.\n\t\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for the worst-case scenario is approximately 3.0 miles for chlorine and 3.1 miles for sulfur dioxide.

The liquid chlorine or sulfur dioxide would flash immediately to vapor and fine liquid droplets and be carried downwind.  The building enclosure would act to reduce the rate of release into the environment but it has been conservatively assumed that the emergency vapor scrubber would fail to activate.\n\t\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for the alternative scenario is est"

Please note that if the emergency vapor scrubber operates as it is designed, this scenario would not extend beyond the building or off site.\n\n4.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\t\n\tThe DWRF complies with EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for employees as well as community members and the environment. The plant operators and other employees are trained in safety practices and documentation of safety policies and procedures are available to employees.  The facility has written standard operating procedures that are followed in the day to day operation of the facility.  In addition, the employees receive continuous on the job training as well as special training sessions when new pieces of equipment are installed.  The DWRF maintenance program is well established and documented to insure the proper operation of all equipment.  Furthermore, the facility has set up procedures for compliance audits and incident investigations that will be implemented when necessary.\n\t\n\tThe employees responsible for overseeing and assisting in the delivery and transfer of chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are all plant operators who are certified by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.  In addition, the plant operators are trained in the hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and the steps to be taken in an emergency situation to mitigate the release of these compounds.\n\t\n\t\n\t5.\tFive-year accident hi"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt the Drake Water Reclamation Facility, two chemicals considered hazardous by US EPA, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, are utilized.  The properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide make them valuable for disinfecting and dechlorinating wastewater treatment plant effluent.  These same properties make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of the facility employees, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of the Fort Collins Utilities to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations concerning handling and storage of these materials.  Safety depends upon the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of the Utility personnel.\n\nThe Facility\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response procedures include notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are enclosed within a building on City property to help keep them secure.  This building also contains an emergency vapor scrubber that will activate in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\t\n\tThe regulated substances handled at this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  \n\t\n\tThe primary purpose of the Drake Water Reclamation Facility (DWRF) is to treat wastewater for the City of Fort Collins.  Chlorine is used to disinfect treated effluent prior to discharge.  Sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the effluent just before it is released from the facility.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide vessels are received by truck and are placed"
