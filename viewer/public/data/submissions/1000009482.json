      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt the Drake Water Reclamation Facility, two chemicals considered hazardous by US EPA, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, are utilized.  The properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide make them valuable for disinfecting and dechlorinating wastewater treatment plant effluent.  These same properties make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of the facility employees, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of the Fort Collins Utilities to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations concerning handling and storage of these materials.  Safety depends upon the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of the Utility personnel.\n\nThe FacilityA?s emergency response procedures include notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are enclosed within a building on City property to help keep them secure.  This building also contains an emergency vapor scrubber that will activate in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n    \n    The regulated substances handled at this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  \n    \n    The primary purpose of the Drake Water Reclamation Facility (DWRF) is to treat wastewater for the City of Fort Collins.  Chlorine is used to disinfect treated effluent prior to discharge.  Sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the effluent just before it is released from the facility.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide vessels are received by truck and are placed "

      "SummaryText": "inside the chlorine/sulfur dioxide building where they are stored until needed.  The storage capacity of each cylinder vessel is 2,000 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The DWRF storage area has a total capacity for six chlorine cylinders, therefore the maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at the facility is approximately 12,000 pounds.  The total number of sulfur dioxide cylinders that can be kept on site is four, therefore the maximum amount of sulfur dioxide that can be stored at the facility is 8,000 pounds.\n    \n    \n \n3.    The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nA?    Worst-Case Scenario A? After careful review of potential worst-case scenarios, it was determined that a cylinder unloading accident that causes rupture of the vessel outside of the building is the worst-case.  This could cause the contents of either a chlorine or sulfur dioxide vessel (2000 pounds) to be released outside.\n    \nA?    The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for the worst-case scenario is approximately 3.0 miles for chlorine and 3.1 miles for sulfur dioxide. The estimated residential population within distance to endpoint would be approximately 72,000 for chlorine and 77,000 for sulfur dioxide based on U.S. Census Bureau City Data Book.\n    \nA?    Alternative Scenario A? A pig tail pipe snapping from either a chlorine or sulfur dioxide vessel causing a flashing liquid release through a small hole approximately A? inch diameter is the alternative release scenario.  The liquid chlorine or sulfur dioxide would flash immediately to vapor and fine liquid droplets and be carried downwind.  The building enclosure would act to reduce the rate of release into the environment but it has been conservatively assumed that the emergency vapor scrubber would fail to activate.\n    \nA?    The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for the alternative scenario is est"

The estimated residential population within distance to endpoint would be approximately 2,900 for chlorine and 2,000 for sulfur dioxide based on U.S. Census Bureau City Data Book. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary, as the RMP rule dictates.  Please note that if the emergency vapor scrubber operates as it is designed, this scenario would not extend beyond the building or off site.\n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n    \n    The DWRF complies with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for employees as well as community members and the environment. The plant operators and other employees are trained in safety practices and documentation of safety policies and procedures are available to employees.  The facility has written standard operating procedures that are followed in the day to day operation of the facility.  In addition, the employees receive continuous on the job training as well as special training sessions when new pieces of equipment are installed.  The DWRF maintenance program is well established and documented to insure the proper operation of all equipment.  Furthermore, the facility has set up procedures for compliance audits and incident investigations that will be implemented when necessary.\n    \n    The employees responsible for overseeing and assisting in the delivery and transfer of chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are all plant operators who are certified by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.  In addition, the plant operators are trained in the hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and the steps to be taken in an emergency situation to mitigate the release of these compounds.\n    \n    \n    5.

The emergency response program:\n    \n    The facilityA?s emergency response program is based upon the management system, already in place, and appropriate discovery and notification procedures to ensure coordination with local emergency responders.  This program has been discussed with the Poudre Valley Fire Authority.  Mock drills with the Poudre Valley Fire Authority have been performed in the past.  \n    \n    7.    Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nA process hazard analysis (Program Level 2 Hazard Review) of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems was conducted on May 20, 2009.  From this review, the recommendations were:  \n\nA?    Keep latest hard copies of inspection reports in RMP\n\nA?    Add A?Prescreening of chemical supply vendorsA? to standard operating procedure (SOP)\n\nA?     Add A?Attendant shall check delivery papersA? to SOP\n\nA?    Schedule an onsite Fire Department Drill as soon as possible\n\nA?    Schedule periodic evacuation drills\n\nA?    Add filter cleaning procedure to SOP\n\nA?
