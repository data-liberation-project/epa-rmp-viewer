      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe City of Dallas Water Utilities maintains a policy of safe water and wastewater treatment plant operation, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the treatment processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, their employees, and the environment. They cooperate with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote effective contingency planning in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs.\n\nAs part of this policy, Dallas Water Utilities maintains compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency??A?s (USEPA) regulations for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.   Facilities covered by the regulations (40 CFR 68) are required to implement a risk management program and submit a description of the program (called a risk management plan, or RMP) to USEPA.  \n\nThe Eastside Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage and use of chlorine and ammonia.  The amounts stored for both chemicals exceed the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  Dallas Water Utilities first submitted a RMP for the Eastside WTP to USEPA in 1999, and again in 2004.  RMPs must be updated and resubmitted to USEPA every five (5) years.  The following information summarizes the Eastside WTP 2009 update and resubmission.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Eastside Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine combined with ammonia to disinfect water.  The plant receives raw water from Lake Tawakoni, Lake Fork, and Lake Ray Hubbard.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped into the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.\n\n1. Chlorine\nThe Eastside WTP regularly has a maximum storage quantity of 1 million (1,000,000) tons of chlorine at its facility.  The chlorine is sto"

The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.  \n\nThe majority of chlorine is delivered to the Eastside WTP by railroad on rail spurs and is stored in the two 90-ton railroad tank cars inside the Chlorine Storage facility and up to three 90-ton railroad tank cars outside the building.  A chlorine tanker truck supplies chlorine for the two 25-ton emergency tanks which are located in the Chlorine Storage Facility. \n\n\nThe existing chlorine feed facilities at the Eastside WTP consist of the inside storage tanks (two 90-ton rail cars and two 25-ton bulk tanks), liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, eight evaporators, gas piping and miscellaneous valves, five pre-chlorinators, four post-chlorinators, and a scrubber system.  A release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area or at the chlorine process areas.\n\n2. Ammonia\nThe Eastside WTP stores ammonia in two 30-ton stationary tanks.  As an administrative control, these tanks are only filled to 85% capacity.  Therefore, the maximum amount of ammonia stored onsite at one time is 50 tons.  The total amount of ammonia exceeds the threshold limit of 10,000 pounds set by USEPA.\n\nAmmonia is delivered to the Eastside WTP by a tanker truck and is stored in the stationary tanks located inside the Ammonia Facility.  \n\nThe existing ammonia feed facilities at the Eastside WTP consist of the two 30-ton stationary tanks, liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, four evaporators, gas piping and miscellaneous valves, five pre-ammoniators, and four post-ammoniators.  A release of ammonia gas could potentially occur at the ammonia storage area or at the ammonia process areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nIn May 2009, Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. reviewed and updated the offsite consequence analyses at Eastside WTP by identifying and documenting a worse case scenario ("

EPA??A?s RMP*Comp was used as the model for the resubmission.  \n\nThe results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Eastside WTP was reviewed for the period from June 1999 through June 2004.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Dallas Water Utilities maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of chlorine and ammonia at Eastside WTP.  The program consists of seven elements:\n\n1. Safety Information\nDallas Water Utilities has maintained information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment as part of their risk management program at Eastside WTP.  The information is made available to employees and contractors at Eastside WTP who will work in the chlorine and ammonia process area.  Emergency response planners can also use the information to develop training programs and procedures.\n\n2. Hazard Review\nA hazard review of chlorine and ammonia processes and procedures is conducted at least every five (5) years to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  A chlorine and ammonia hazard review using the ??A?What-If??A? method was conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. with the assistance of Eastside WTP plant management and staff familiar with the process??A? operation and maintenance in June, 2009.  Existing precautions were reviewed and determined to be adequate.  Potential changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that could further improve the overall safety of the chlorine and ammonia systems were identified.\n\nThe results of thi"

Operating procedures\nDallas Water Utilities have developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide instructions and steps for conducting activities associated with the chlorine and ammonia processes at Eastside WTP consistent with the safety information. Eastside WTP operating procedures include startup, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n4. Training\nAll Eastside WTP staff currently involved in chlorine and ammonia processes have been trained in the classroom and/or during on-the-job training in an overview of the processes and in the operating procedures, as is new staff assigned to the processes.  Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure Eastside WTP staff understands and adheres to current operating procedures.  \n\n5. Maintenance\nEastside WTP has developed and implemented a preventive and corrective maintenance program to ensure equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and ammonia is functioning properly and installed to minimize the risk of releases.   The program addresses equipment testing, inspection, and preventive maintenance schedules, and documentation of equipment testing, inspection, and preventive and corrective maintenance activities. \n\n6. Compliance audits\nUSEPA??A?s risk management rule requires that Eastside WTP complete a compliance audit for its risk management program at least once every 3 years. The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to verify compliance with risk management rule requirements and good process safety prac"

The risk management rule also requires that copies of the last 2 audits are maintained as part of the written program.\n\nMalcolm Pirnie, Inc., with the assistance of Eastside WTP plant management and staff familiar with the processes operation and maintenance, conducted an audit in March 2009. The results of this both audits, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records. Copies of audits performed in 2004 and 2007 are also available. \n\n7. Incident Investigation\nEastside WTP management investigates each incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine or ammonia. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. \n\nAn incident investigation team will be established following criteria established in the Eastside WTP risk management program.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, additional training and competency requirements), to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\nOn 6/15/2009 an incident occurred when an employee was disassembling a component of the liquid ammonia system. The component contained liquid ammonia and sprayed employee in the face. Employee was taken to a local hospital, treated and release with a return to work date of 6/18/2009.  The employee was not wearing PPE.

      "SummaryText": "ture.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed for Eastside WTP, which provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia to ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  These procedures include leak investigation, operational-level response activities, and communications to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Dallas Fire Department HAZMAT Team, in the event of an emergency. \n\nDallas Water Utilities updated and incorporated the ERP, as well as sections of the risk management program, into an all-hazard integrated contingency plan (ICP) in 2007.  The ICP format minimizes duplication in the preparation and use of emergency response and risk management plans for various regulatory requirements, and eliminates confusion for Eastside WTP staff that would have had to decide which plan applies to a particular emergency.\n\nEastside WTP staff are also participating in DWU-wide ongoing emergency response preparation and training consisting of training and drills at the awareness, performance (operational and technician) and National Incident Management System (NIMS) / Incident Command System (ICS) levels.\n\nRECOMMENDED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n- Require certification of chemicals from manufacturer upon delivery\n\n"
