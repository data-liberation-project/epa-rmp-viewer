A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained an Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n\n1.2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 1361 Southern Road, Morrow, Georgia. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 62,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n1.3.\tRelease Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the volume of the single High Pressure Receiver (a maximum of (62,000 lbs) .  No administrative controls and mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 2.8 miles.\nThe alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia from a ruptured evaporator coil caused by thermal expansion due to double blocking of the line.  The largest-evaporator coils (EC-1 and EC-2) were assumed and a volume of 2,357 lbs of ammonia were used for release calculations.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were consid"

The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 mile.\n\n1.4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at Fresh Express is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.  \nThis includes:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tCompliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPerformance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information\n\u00c2\u00bf\tImplementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed by PHA\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAppropriate initial and refresher training of system operations and maintenance personnel  \n\u00c2\u00bf\tPerformance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout and hot work permit programs\n\u00c2\u00bf\tApplication of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols\n\u00c2\u00bf\tUse of qualified contractors for work on the system\nThe detailed Ammonia System Release Prevention Program is contained in a supporting document (revised and updated May, 2010) which is maintained at the site\u00c2\u00bfs Safety Office.\n\n1.5.\tFive Year Accident History\nBetween December, 2004 (the previous revalidation of the site program) and the present, no ammonia releases resulted in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. However, the following ammonia-related incidents occurred:\n\u00c2\u00bf\t1/12/05 - There was a release of ~11 lbs in the pumper drum room from pump #2 on the #4 recirculator.  The leak w"

The unit was repaired and put back online.\n\u00c2\u00bf\t3/4/05 - There was a release of ~2lbs of NH3 vapor.  The leak was discovered by vendor technicians that noted an ammonia smell.  The vendor notified Fresh Express refrigeration technicians.  The production floor was evacuated.  The investigation showed a leak at the Air Handler Coil #12 in the salad processing area.  The unit was shut down, all NH3 was pumped out, thus stopping the release.  The production area was ventilated to clear the ammonia smell and then re-occupied.  The unit was repaired and put back online.\n\u00c2\u00bf\t12/26/06 - There was a release of approximately 20 to 30 lbs of ammonia during a PRV (Pressure Relief Valve) replacement on the Zone 2 recirculator.  The PRV was isolated via the three way valve.  When the PRV was loosened, operators noted a release.  The operators immediately proceeded to isolate the NH3 inlet valve, then decreased the suction pressure to the tank to help lower the pressure and slow the leak.  The room was ventilated and the employees were evacuated.  The operators were able to isolate the leak, replace the PRV and re-occupy the production area.  \n\u00c2\u00bf\t5/31/09 - There was a release of <5lbs of NH3 vapor from Zone 4 Chiller 16.  The ammonia odor was notice by personnel who informed refrigeration operators.  Investigation found a pinhole leak on the chiller plate.  Operators isolated and pumped NH3 out of chiller and stopped the leak.  No evacuation was needed.\n\u00c2\u00bf\t2/3/10 - There was a release of ~1lb of NH3 from Evaporator Coil Zone 1 Chiller 5 in the shipping area.  The leak was detected by plant personnel.  The investigation showed a small leak at the flange of the hot gas pilot.  The unit was isolated and the leak was stopped.  The area was ventilated to remove ammonia odor.

The operators shut the compressor down, located and isolated leak, ventilated the space, replaced the leaking valve and put the compressor back online.  The preventative maintenance procedures will be updated to include periodic valve inspections.\n\n1.6.\tEmergency Response Program\nFresh Express has developed an Emergency Planning and Response document to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to ammonia release emergencies.  The plan is maintained at the site\u00c2\u00bfs Safety Office and reviewed annually.  The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, provides detailed evacuation procedures, and includes response procedures for the mitigation of ammonia releases. \nThe site has an Ammonia Emergency Response Team trained to use the Incident Command System organizational framework.  This is also described in detail in the planning document.\n\n1.7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nBased on the Revalidation Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted on March 17 and 18, 2010 the following adjustments are planned to ensure continued safe operations:\n\n\n#\tActions\tPHA Table\nItem #\tAssignee\tDue Date /\nStatus\n1.\t\tAdd signage prohibiting combustible storage near the HPR.\t9\tVann\t\n2.\t\tInstall PRV\u00c2\u00bfs on the condenser to prevent an excessive overpressure of condenser due to equipment shut down.\t56\tVann\t\n3.\t\tDevelop a procedure for a monthly verification that diffusion tank is adequately filled.\t77\tVann"
