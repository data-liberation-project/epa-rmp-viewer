Periodic equipment inspections are performed to assure the equipment integrity. The inspections utilize recognized codes and procedures that are followed by specially trained individuals. Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized and can include vibration monitoring, infrared imaging, inspections by independent experts, inspections by insurance specialists and root-cause analysis investigations. Piping systems are inspected and tested with X-rays and hydrostatic tests prior to operation. The piping is monitored by a variety of methods to assure its condition.  Maintenance personnel are included in many of the training and testing programs that the operators utilize.  Additional training and procedures have been developed for activities that are specific to maintenance.  \n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nNo accidents have occurred within the past five years, therefore no accidents are to be reported in the executive summary.\n\nNotif"
