      "SummaryText": "Accidental release and emergency response policies at the Elan facility are summarized in a Emergency Response Plan (ERP), prepared in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38. The stationary source is a 15,000 gallon above ground storage tank which holds a maximum of 7,000 gallons of the regulated chemical ethyl chloride. Ethyl chloride is listed as a regulated substance due to it's nature as a flammable gas. The worst case release scenario simulates the release of 52,000 pounds of ethyl chloride that results in a vapor cloud explosion. Utilizing the EPA simulation model RMP Comp, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure as a result of the worst case release senario is 0.2 miles from the stationary source. The alternative release scenario simulates a release from a 520 gallon reactor tank assumed to contain a maximum of 3,900 pounds of ethyl chloride. Utilizing RMP Comp, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure from a  vapor cloud explosion resulting from a release from the recator is 0.1 miles. Currently there are no public receptors within the distance to the overpressure end point. However, a new Essex County Correctional Facility is under construction that will be located approximately 300 feet from Elan property limits. At the time of this RMP submittal, the completion date and the proposed population of said correctional facility is unknown. The general accidental release prevention program for the Elan facility includes employee training, pressure relief vents, and interlocks. There has not been a reportable accidental release of ethyl chloride in the past 5 years. The emergency response program is coordinated with the Newark HAZMAT Team, local fire department, and emergeny health care professionals. Planned chages to improve saftey include interlocks and continued employee training."
