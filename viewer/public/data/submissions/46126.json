If an emergency were to occur, Schering-Plough HealthCare Products, Inc. would coordinate with the Cleveland Fire Department and other agencies as appropriate to respond to an emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled. This facility packages consumer aerosol products received from another manufacturer into individual consumer units. As a result of warehousing, Schering-Plough HealthCare Products, Inc. stores aerosol products in their warehouse containing a mixture of the following regulated substances under 112(r) stored above the threshold quantity: \n\n* Propane \n* Dimethyl Ether \n\nThe worst-case release scenario. The worst-case scenario is failure of one 36-gram aerosol container. The worst-case scenario would affect a radius of 0.003 miles, which does not affect off-site receptors.  Due to limitations of RMP*Submit, the input parameters were 1 pound and 0.01 miles.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and applicable state and local codes and regulations. \n\nFive-year accident history. No accidents involving the aerosol products stored at this facility have caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings-in-place at this facility.\n\nThe emergency response program. If an emergency were to occur, Schering-Plough HealthCare Products, Inc. would coordinate with the Cleveland Fire Department and other agencies as appropriate to respond to an emergency.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety. The facility will continue its Process Safety Management program."
