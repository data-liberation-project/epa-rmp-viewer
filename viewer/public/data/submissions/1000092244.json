This facility has a Process Safety Management plan which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program requirements. It also has a Safety Management System in place that includes items such as Lock-out/Tag-out, Hazard Communication, Contractor Safety, etc. \n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan in place to aid in the prevention of accidental releases and natural disasters that may affect the facility. The Greater Houston LEPC and the Houston Fire Department have been provided copies of this plan. If a release were to occur at this location, associates would be notified of the release by activation of the audible alarm and muster at the evacuation point for a head count.  If the operator of the system in question is unable to mitigate the release using manual valves, the emergency shutdown system will be utilized to shut down all the pumps and components of the systems to prevent any further operation. If the release cannot be mitigated safely notification shall be made to the Houston Fire Department by calling 911. The Houston Fire Department will respond to a release at this location and are trained in Hazardous Material operations. \n\nAirgas Specialty Gases addresses safety planning on a continuous basis to allow for improvement to our safe operation of all systems and further our safety culture. Inspections are conducted to identify any potential safety issues that would allow for improvement to all systems, policies and procedures. The facility has monthly safety meetings and a good catch"

      "SummaryText": "reporting system and the associates are trained to bring all safety issues to the attention of the management team immediately so they can be addressed.\n\nThe flammable worst case scenarios would be the failure of the bulk vessel storing ethylene or methane.  These releases, if the vessel were full, would result in a release of 38,475 pounds or 38,500 pounds respectively.  Active mitigation was considered for this release, including excess flow valves and manual shutoffs.  No passive mitigation was considered.  The distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 0.3 miles for both chemicals.  The area surrounding the facility is considered to be urban (industrial).  This release scenario could impact approximately zero persons in a 0.28 square mile area.  This information was determined using RMP*Comp and MARPLOT 4.2.4 Software.  Additionally the worst case release for ethane was considered which would result in 10,000 lbs of ethane being released from tube trailers. The DTE for this scenario is 0.2 miles.\n\nAn alternative flammable release of ethylene from a PRD (pressure relief device) would be the most probable release for this location.  Ethylene is filled into DOT approved high pressure steel vessels equipped with DOT approved valves and PRDs (pressure relief devices). Cylinder valve PRD's generally are the weakest point of the package and if there was a release it most likely would occur at the PRD. If this were to occur an estimated release would be approximately 32 pounds per minute.  This release would have a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.  Within the area there would be approximately zero persons affected.  There are no residences in this area and the surrounding area is comprised of office/industrial facilities. There has been no accidental release from this facility in the past five years."
