Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Houston Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturer.  We have 7 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide], Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Carbon disulfide, Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer), Propionitrile and Sulfur trioxide.  Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] is used for is used as a chemical intermediate, as a drying agent and is a raw material for dyes and detergents.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used as a chemical intermediate, refrigerant, bleaching and food processing..  Carbon disulfide, Toluene diisocyanate, Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] and Propionitrile are received as a waste stream for energy recovery and raw material value.  Sulfur trioxide is used as an intermediate in the production of high purity acid used in the electronic industry.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] at our facility is 34,000,000 lb., while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Carbon disulfide, Toluene diisocyanate, Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], Propionitrile and Sulfur trioxide are present at our facilit"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Sulfur Dioxide.  In this scenario 300,000 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 80% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 19 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release of Sulfur Dioxide.  The scenario involves the release of 1,500 lb. liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s) and emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the length of time the release would occur. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is 0.6 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Carbon disulfide involves a release from TS Carbon Disulfide."

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.16 mg/L of Carbon Disulfide is 0.27 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Trioxide involves a release from TXUP, of Sulfur Trioxide.  The scenario involves the release of 5000 lb. of liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 570 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of reducing the surface area of the liquid pool and enclosing the gas release inside a building. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.010 mg/L of Sulfur trioxide is 0.26 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] involves a release from Regen 2 Unit.  The scenario involves the release of 2175 lb. of liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.
