The facility is committed to providing employees a safe working environment.  To ensure this standard, the Lowcountry Regional Water System has established safe working practices, standard operating procedures, and accident prevention programs.  Management is dedicated to training employees on proper operating procedures, emergency response, and equipment use.  To prevent accidental releases of chemicals, the Lowcountry Regional Water System follows all applicable sections of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program. The Lowcountry Regional Water System has enlisted the help of the Hampton Fire Department for emergency response to comply with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nII.  The Hampton Wastewater Treatment Plant treats domestic and industrial wastewater from the Town of Hampton and the Town of Varnville with a capacity of 2.0 million gallons per day.  The plant consists of a mechanically cleaned bar screen, five aeration basins, filter beds, and a chlorine contact chamber and post aeration basin. The chlorination system, installed at the plant to disinfect the effluent flow before discharging the treated wastewater into Sanders Branch, is housed in stand alone buildings where the chlorinators, safety equipment and instrumentation are located. The chlorine containers are stored in one-ton cylinders and 150-pound cylinders liquefied under pressure outside the building under a separate cover. The maximum quantity of chlorine on site is contained in two cylinders and eight 150-pound cylinders totaling 5,200-pounds. \n\n\n\nIII.  The Lowcountry Regional Water System follows the EPA guidelines for Risk Management and the guidelines established by OSHA for Process Safety Management.  The two codes require the Lowcountry Regional Water System to evaluate the "

The Lowcountry Regional Water System completed a Process Hazard Analysis to review the causes and effects of a chemical release.  \n\n\n\nThe Lowcountry Regional Water System developed a preventative maintenance program to keep the chlorine equipment in optimum condition. Any equipment not in proper working order is immediately evaluated for repair or replacement.\n\n\n\nIn addition to a preventative maintenance program, the Lowcountry Regional Water System has established standard operating procedures in conjunction with the Chlorine Institute and manufacturer's recommendations.  Employees are required to follow the standard procedures at the plant, especially near a highly hazardous chemical area.  All employees are trained prior to exposure to equipment and provided refresher training at least every three years.  Chemical awareness is discussed both in training and during monthly safety meetings where employees can discuss any hazards or potential hazards of the chlorine system.\n\n\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the installation of the gas monitors and alarm system.  Self-contained breathing apparatus, gloves, goggles and aprons are available for employees for protection against a chlorine leak.\n\n\n\nIV.  No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility within the last five years.\n\n\n\nV.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant is covered under the community emergency response program.  The Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), is qualified to handle a chlorine leak or spill at the wastewater treatment plant.  Wastewater treatment plant employees are trained on proper emergency response during the employee training sessions."
