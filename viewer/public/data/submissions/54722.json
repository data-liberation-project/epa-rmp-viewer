The plant has also implemented all the elements of Williams Midstream's System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards. The Larose Cryogenic Plant's Emergency Response Plan is site-specific. It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\nThe Larose Cryogenic Plant processes raw natural gas into pipeline quality natural gas and natural gas liquids. The raw material is received by pipeline. The finished products are delivered to pipelines.  The regulated chemicals in the process are:\nMethane\nEthane\nPropane\ni-Butane\nButane\ni-Pentane\nPentane \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe Larose Cryogenic Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards In the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs): The Larose Cryogenic Plant uses PSSRs as a part of the construction process. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.\nMechanical Integrity: Larose Cryogenic Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices utilized by the Larose Cryogenic Plant include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and    exit of support personnel, and lock out tag out procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible mater"

Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\nManagement of Change: The Larose Cryogenic Plant utilizes a Management of Change process. In this, changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\nIncident Investigation: The Larose Cryogenic Plant utilizes an Incident Investigation process. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\nCompliance Audits: At the Larose Cryogenic Plant, audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable RMP / PSM I SIP\nprocedures and regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nNo release of a regulated substance has occurred in the last 5 years.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\nThe Larose Cryogenic Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including\nevacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.
