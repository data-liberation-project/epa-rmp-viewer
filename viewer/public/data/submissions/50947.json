Health, safety and environmental compliance area fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local regulations and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in acordance withits Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the LEPC and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the evnironment and the general public.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Mason City, Iowa location is Tony Cockrell, operations. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Rgeistration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n          Tony Cockrell, operations\n                  Work: (641) 424-9500\n                  24-hour: (641) 425-3987\n\n          Josh Featherston\n                  Work: (641) 424-9500\n                  24-hour: (641) 425-3989\n\n          Wayne Steven\n                  Work: (641) 424-9500\n                  24-hour: (507) 402-1492                 \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is th estorage, handling and mixing of fertilizers for direct wholesale to local cooperatives.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, mixed and used for manufacturing of 10-34-0 and starter grades.

This facility is loaded by transport truck; therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the on-site storage tanks are at the maximum fill level of 85%.\n\nLiquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to th ereactor via a flexible hose to th ereactor thank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high pressure gas cargo tank and stored in pressurized aboveground storage tank.\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank, through a meter and then through a heat exchanger where th eliquid anhydrous ammonia is vaporized.  After the heat exchanger, the anhydrous ammonia vapor is mixed with the water and phosphoric acid, which is pumped from t hephosphoric acid rail car to the reactor.  The anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid react to form ammonium phosphates and heat.  The ammonium phosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium phosphate solution (i.e. 10-34-0).\n\nSituated above th eholding pool is a cooling tower with a fan that pulls air up the towe off of the holding pool.  The ammonium phosphate solution is pumped to the top of the cooling tower where it flows down packing (pall rings) back down to th eholding pool.  While falling down the packing, the water evaoporates and cools the solution.\n\nSome of the ammonium phosphate solution in the holding pool is pumped out to the anhydrous ammonia heat exchanger.  The warm ammonium phosphate solution is used to vaporize th eanhydrous ammonia liquid from th eanhydrous ammonia tank.  The ammonium phosphate solution which is cooled by th eanhydrous ammonia vaporization, flows back to the holding pool and some of the solution flows to a storage tank.\n\nWOST CASE RELEA"

According to EPA's RMP Comp Program (Version 1.06) the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves th etransport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.  \n\nThe system is protected from major releases by a series of valves and breakaway couplers, all designed to stop the contents flow in the event of a break.  When not in use, the storage tank valves are locked.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the of the facility's release prevention program.\n\n(1) Safety Information:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  MSDS, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the anhydrous ammonia equipment are maintained at the facility.\n\n(2) Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and th esteps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of th ereviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timel"

In addition, it is facility protocol to not store combustible material under or immediately adjacent to the bulk anhydrous ammonia tank(s) or to locate petroleum or propane storage tanks immediately adjacent to the bulk anhydrous ammonia tank(s).\n\n(3) Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.111 and ANSI Standard K-61-1989 with amendments.  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n(4) Training:  All employees at this facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training program.  The initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g. reading safety information, operating procedures and response measures) followed by a written test and on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every yesr.  The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n(5) Mechanical Intergrity:  Written procedures are established to maintain th eongoing integrity of process equipment.  Each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment is trained in an overview of that process and its hazards and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to ensure the ability to safely perform their job duties.  Inspections and tests are performed on process equipment following recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The frequency of inspections and tests on process equipment is consistent with applicable good engineering practices.\n\nDocumentation of each inspection and test on process equipment is maintained in the appropriate format.

Safety information or operating procedures or practices are updated accordingly.\n\n(7) Pre-Start Up Review:  When modifications to new stationary sources or modified stationary sources is significant enough to require a change in process safety information, a review of pre-startup safety is performed.  The pre-startup safety review includes a review of the following:\n                      Construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, safety, operating, maintenance and        \n                      emergency procedures are in place and are adequate, (for new stationary sources ) a process hazard analysis \n                      has bee performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup, and training of each\n                      employee involved in operating a process has been completed.\n\n(8) Compliance Audits:  As required by RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three (3) years.

Hot Work Permits are issued for all electrical work beyonf the scope of facility personnel training to subcontractors.\n\n(12) Contractors:  When the facility selects a contractor the protocol is to obtain and evaluate the safety performance of the contractor.  Before access to the facility is given to the contractor, the protocol is to inform the contractor about facility hazards and the emergency response activities.  Protocol for the contractor at the facility is to have safe work practices to control the entrance, presence and exit of contract employees in covered process areas.
