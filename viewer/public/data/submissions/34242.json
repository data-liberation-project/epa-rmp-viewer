KNC?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the ammonia terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the 5 year accident history of the terminal and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Conway Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the terminal, anhydrous ammonia is delivered by pipeline and stored until it is loaded on to trucks for distribution or injected into the pipeline for delivery to another facility.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Conway Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n?Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n?Operating and maintaining the assets "

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Requiring trucks to have a brake interlock system that helps prevent a truck driver from driving away before the loading arm is properly disconnected.\n?Providing an interlock system, which will shutdown ammonia loading pumps upon high pressure, low pressure or excess flow.\n?Providing emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel in case of an ammonia release. \n?Ammonia sensors in the process area and on the property to detect ammonia and activate the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition monitoring system if the threshold for ammonia is exceeded.\n?Loading trucks only when KNC personnel are on site and can monitor activities.  \n?Requiring truck drivers to stay with the truck during the entire loading process within reach of the emergency shutdown button in case of an ammonia release.\n?Requiring personal protection equipment at all loading areas and supply emergency air in the control rooms.\n?Providing annual truck loading training to ensure driver safety. \n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the last five years there have been no chemical release accidents that resulte"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Conway Police Department, McPherson County Sheriff and, as appropriate, the area hospitals and the utility company.  The Conway Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n:\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the terminal include:\n\n?Installing continuous pilots in the flare to minimize the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of ammonia vapors.\n?Installing dual seals on pumps to help prevent the release of"
