A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals. The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect BC Systems employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n\n\n\nDue to the seasonality of this operation, the Yuma, Arizona facility is operational for six months out of the year - from November to April. During the on-season months, there are five portable ammonia refrigeration systems on site and operational. There is additional ammonia stored in a nurse tank. During the off-months (May through October) three of the refrigeration units are transported to an alternate location and the total quantity of ammonia is stored in nurse tanks. One unit remains at Yuma full time, but this is considered portable due to its configuration. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration units are used for room cooling.\n\n \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe BC Systems plant covered by this RMP is located at 6581 East Cattle Drive, Yuma, Arizona. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site. The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. Four portable units use ammonia refrigeration in the product cooling process. The Cooler system uses ammonia refrigeration to maintain product at various temperatures. Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at BC Systems is accomplished through the following:\n\n?    sound industry practice"
