Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. Manufacturers' manuals on all equipment are kept on file for review as needed.\n\nCompliance Audits - The City of Lake Charles conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigations - The City of Lake Charles Water Division will promptly investigate any known incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance.  These investigations will be undertaken to determine the situation that led to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  Procedures are in place and are being implemented for the above.  Initial training was given to all personnel on these procedures.  The procedures will be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.\n\nTraining - The City of Lake Charles Water Division implemented a  comprehensive training program for our employees to ensure that those persons who are operating the chlorine process are competent .  We have developed training information that cover items such as unloading of ton containers, storage of ton containers, installing the chlorinators on a container, general parts used in the chlorination system, general operation of the chlorination system, troubleshooting of chlorine feed problems, maintenance of chlorine system,  hazards associated with the chlorine process, and reporting requirements in case of a release.  We have certified that our personnel are competent to operate the chlorine processes.

The plant is unmanned and is monitored and operated via a SCADA system by the operator on duty 24 hours at the GH West Plant.  Chlorine gas is used in the treatment process as an oxidizer of dissolved iron in the water and as the primary disinfectant to inhibit microbial growth.  Chlorine ton containers are delivered to the facility on regular basis and off loaded and stored for use.  There are normally two ton containers connected to chlorinators for use as needed.  Only one chlorinator and cylinder is in use at the same time.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored at this plant is 4,000 pounds or two ton containers.  Only authorized and trained personnel perform maintenance on or operate the regulated process.\n\nc) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

GENERAL EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCenter East Water Plant\nLDEQ Facility  ID Number - 27748\nEPA ID: 1000 0004 1527\n  \na) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\nThe City of Lake Charles Water Division is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. We are aware that the use of some of our treatment chemicals could pose a risk to the public under certain circumstances. We therefore are committed to development of a comprehensive risk management program for the Center East Plant. The program will address areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorine processes at our facilities. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and operate the regulated process. The use of chlorine has been standard in the water treatment industry for many years and the safety of its use has improved greatly throughout that time. The inherent safety of the vacuum operated chlorination system, combined with safe handling procedures make the use of chlorine a reliable process. In-depth and ongoing training programs for our personnel will make the use of chlorine even safer for our employees and the members of the surrounding community. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of any regulated substance.\n\nIf such a release does occur, we have met with and coordinated our release planning with the City of Lake Charles Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release. The procedures developed under this plan have also been included in the local community response plan as required under the rule. Plant personnel have been trained on how and when to notify emergency responders if the need arises\n\nb)  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe Center East Water Plant is a municipal water treatment facility.
