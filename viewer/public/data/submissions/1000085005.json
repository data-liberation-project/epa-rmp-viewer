This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes.  San Mateo's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Black River Processing Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Black River Processing Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\n\n\n\nThe facility is a non-fractionating NGL extraction plant that is designed to process natural gas. Plant 1 is designed for 60 MMSCFD and Plant 2 and Plant 3 are each designed for 200 MMSCFD. The facility consists of the following: inlet gas separation and filtration, inlet compression, dehydration, regeneration systems, condensate stabilization, amine treatment unit, cryogenic processing units, refrigeration systems, residue compression, flare system, and all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in five 500-barrel atmospheric tanks located within secondary containment areas and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGL from the cryogenic units and natural gas from residue compression are sent offsite via pipeline without intermediate storage. \n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's de"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the regulated substance in the facility.  \n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Black River Processing Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.    Tanks are gauged\n\n2.    Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n\n3.    High/Low alarms and shutdowns\n\n4.    Facility is staffed 24-hours a day, 7-days a week \n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1.    Berms around tanks\n\n2.    Process relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels from rupturing\n\n3.    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n4.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n5.    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1.    Trained emergency response personnel\n\n2.    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n\n3.    SPCC Plan\n\n4.    Fire extinguishers\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Black River Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally release"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Black River Processing Plant is coordinated with the Eddy County LEPC. The Eddy County Emergency Management can be reached at 575-628-5450 for non-emergencies or by calling 911 in the case of an emergency.  The Black River Processing Plant has around-the-clock communications capability. San Mateo operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Loving or Malaga Fire Departments). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. San Mateo conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations and the Black River Processing Plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\n\n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Black River P"
