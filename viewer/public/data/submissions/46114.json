This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with galveston co.-texas city lepc which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility which is Chlorine.\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 4000 Ibs.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-case analyses\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from chlorination. The scenario involves the release of 4000 Ib. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The Release rate (Ibs/min) is calculated to be 400. A distance to endpoint of 9.9 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 25258 within this distance.\n\nToxic Alternative-case analyses\nThe Alternative Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from chlorination.  The scenario involves the release of 2600 Ib. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 260 minutes. The Release rate (Ibs/ min) is calculated to be 10 and a Distance to endpoint of 0.38 mil es is obtained which affects a residential populatio"

A number of processes at our facility are subjec t to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHitchcock wwtp maintains a detailed record of safety information t hat describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is what/ if. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of one year. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Hitchcock wwtp maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after aturn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHitchcock wwtp has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations"

Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHitchcock wwtp carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels,storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Hitchcock wwtp to manage change s in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Pro cess operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Hitchcock wwtp.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nHitchcock wwtp conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whe ther the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implement ed. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nHitchcock wwtp promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a re gulated substance.

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nHitchcock wwtp truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strong ly encouraged to express their views concerning accident preventio n issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employee s have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule. Including information resulting f rom process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a con tractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contra ctor is carried out. Hitchcock wwtp has a strict policy of informi ng the contractors of known potential hazards related the contract or's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental releas e of a regulated substance occur.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nHitchcock wwtp has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent \nrelease prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nFacility is included in written Community ER Plan.\nThe Local agency coordinating ER Plan Is galveston co.-texas city\nlepc which has the phone number 409-643-5707\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Additional training and demonstration are some of the ma jor steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility. These changes are expected to be implemented by January 2000."
