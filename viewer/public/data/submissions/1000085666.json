The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the HP-A San Antonio facility is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of the HP-A San Antonio facility's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, the HP-A San Antonio facility is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the HP-A San Antonio refrigeration system. The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeratio"

The \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the HP-A San Antonio building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\n\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place.

To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, the HP-A San Antonio facility is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n\n\nThe San Antonio County Emergency response is discussed in the Risk Management Program (RMP) binder of the completeprogram. HP-A San Antonio is not a responding facility, hence it has a detailed Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for their facility. The facility will evacuate or shelter-in-place its employees and call the San Antonio Fire Department to respond to the emergency.The HP-A San Antonio facility conducts scheduled drills of the EAP. TheEAP is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to anaccidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible forresponding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nThe HP-A San Antonio facility is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows the HP-A San Antonio facility to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of HP-A San Antonio employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls.\n\n"
