The City Brewing Company, LLC believes that risks associated with ANHYDROUS AMMONIA storage at this facility are well managed.\r\n\r\nSOURCE AND  PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nRefrigeration is a critical component of malt beverage production. Refrigeration is required for chilling water and beer, and for controlling air temperature in storage cellars. Refrigeration is provided through evaporation of liquid anhydrous ammonia by a heat source. Evaporated ammonia gas is contained in closed loop system where it is mechanically compressed back into a liquid state for re-use on demand. Liquid ammonia is moved by system pressure from storage through piping to locations where refrigeration is needed.\r\n\r\nCity Brewing is committed to providing a safe working environment. We will achieve this mission by promoting a culture in which employee safety is paramount in each and every endeavor. We will actively promote and maintain the following beliefs in everything we do:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety performance is critically important to the success of this company\r\n\u00bf\tConcern for employee safety will be evident and embedded into all phases of our work by design and through the business decisions that we make. \r\n\u00bf\tEach employee is empowered with responsibility for his or her personal safety and the safety of their fellow employees and stakeholders. \r\n\u00bf\tContinuous improvement is a way of life at this facility; we use feedback and experience to refine and build upon our culture to ensure continual forward progress. \r\n\u00bf\tSafety incidents are preventable; we will strive to ensure that our policies, practices, and decisions are proactive on all accounts.\r\n\u00bf\tManagement is responsible for ensuring employees have the knowledge, skills, and equipment necessary to pr"

Operating Engineers and Refrigeration Mechanics perform operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. Each of these key personnel is aware of the provisions of the Ammonia Refrigeration system Risk Management System Risk Management Plan and has contributed to the construction of the plan.\r\n The success of our program depends on all employees incorporating our culture into every part of our day-to-day business practice and decisions.\r\n\r\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nCity Brewing continues to update the comprehensive set of operating procedures to provide instruction in the safe operation of facility processes covered by this RMP.  Procedures shall provide a reliable and consistent reference for all phases of process operations.\r\n\r\nEach procedure contains procedure steps, operating parameters and limits, safety and health hazard information, safety control measures, and assignment of responsibility for performing the procedure.  \r\n \r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nA facility Emergency Action Plan is established to give direction to employees for safe response actions to be taken during fire and other emergencies. Potential ammonia release is addressed in the Emergency Action Plan including notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and medical assistance procedures.\r\n\r\nOperating Engineers and Refrigeration Mechanics are knowledgeable about the ammonia refrigeration system and are trained in first responder awareness.

If possible, the isolation valves would be secured from an unaffected area in response to a substantial release.  In the event of major ammonia gas release, only personnel trained in first responder operations are allowed to enter the affected area with proper personal protective equipment to secure isolation valves.\r\n\r\nArrangements are established with the local emergency response agency, the fire department, and local hospital.\r\n \r\nPeriodic compliance audits will ensure that the plan is kept up-to-date. All employees are trained on this plan during new-hire training and receive refresher training on a routine basis.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThere has not been any accidental release of ammonia from the refrigeration system during the last 5 years that caused any of the following:\r\n\u00bf On-site death, injury, or significant property damage.\r\n\u00bf Known offsite death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place."
