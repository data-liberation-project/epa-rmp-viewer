      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOiltanking Galveston County, LLC\r\n2301 Hwy 146 South\r\nTexas City, TX 77590\r\n\r\nOiltanking Galveston County, LLC (Oiltanking) operates a facility that stores chemicals including hydrocarbons/petroleum products, specialty polymers, solvents, intermediates, monomers and industrial products.  Operations occurring at Oiltanking include loading/unloading, storage, transportation, and distribution of chemicals.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations presented in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68), the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, require Oiltanking to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule because the quantities of vinyl acetate monomer stored onsite exceed threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA-approved chemical release prevention program. In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP covered facilities to update its Risk Management Program Plan (RMP Plan) within six (6) months of an RMP reportable incident or every five (5) years, whichever comes first.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68, Oiltanking is submitting this initial RMP Plan within six (6) months of taking ownership of the site.\r\n\r\nPotential offsite consequences of a hypothetical Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative Releases Scenario (ARS) were conducted using the EPA RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis and the RMP*Comp program.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\r\n\r\nAs required by the RMP regulations, worst-case and alternative release scenarios were generated for toxic releases of the chemical (vinyl acetate monomer) that Oiltanking stores on-site above threshold levels.

Oiltanking complies with the RMP rules and regulations set forth by the EPA and even some elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to ensure the safety of employees and public surroundings. While the VAM is not a PSM chemical and falls under Program 2, other RMP exempt chemicals are onsite that are subject to PSM. \r\n\r\nThe Oiltanking site designed its accident prevention program to comply with both the EPA RMP rules and the relevant portions of OSHA's PSM. Oiltanking incorporates elements addressing the following:\r\n\r\n* Equipment Design - Storage tanks and piping are designed in accordance with recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\r\n\r\n* Process Safety Information - Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\r\n\r\n* Hazard Review - These reviews are completed to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\r\n\r\n* Episodic Risk Management - Periodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards which could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence. These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques.\r\n\r\n* Operational Safety Standards - Design requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in the operational safety standards.\r\n\r\n* Operating Procedures - Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up-to-date.\r\n\r\n* Operator Training Program - The plant has a training and testing program, which provides operators with the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.\r\n\r\n*"

OCA's are essential in identifying the potential hazards of an accidental release. OCA's can consist of two elements, a WCS and an ARS, for each type of chemical (either flammable or toxic handled at the facility in a quantity greater than that chemical's threshold as listed in 40 CFR \u00a768.130).\r\n\r\nThere is one WCS associated with a toxic release of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) at the facility.  The scenario involves a liquid release involving 10,938,665 pounds of VAM from tank 9702. The entire inventory of this tank is assumed to release and evaporate, impacting an area with a 25-mile radius.\r\n\r\nThe ARS associated with the VAM tanks involves a piping failure between the tank and the closest valve. The pipe is six (6) inches in diameter and 120 feet in length, which results in 5,530 lbs of liquid VAM being released and then evaporating. This would impact an area with a 0.3-mile radius.  \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nOiltanking took ownership of the VAM tanks on 4/3/2017. There have been no accidents since that time.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe plans for evacuation and accounting for personnel after an evacuation at the Oiltanking site are located onsite for personnel to review.
