      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\nEquistar Chemicals, LP\nChocolate Bayou Chemical Complex\n\n1. Purpose\n\nThis document describes the Equistar Chemicals Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex's philosophy and procedures for managing risk to employee health, public safety and to the environment.  It is intended to be just a summary of the many policies, procedures and actions that are taken to prevent or mitigate the potential release of chemicals listed under EPA 40 CFR 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP) Under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r)(7).\n\n2. Plant Overview\n\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex is an Olefins and Aromatics production facility.  It manufactures a variety of petrochemical products, which are used by others to manufacture a wide range of products from plastics to gasoline additives.  The complex consists of two production units, the Olefins Unit and the Hydrocarbons Unit and a Distribution Tank Farm Area.  The two units and the tank farm are fully integrated and interconnected in the production of Olefins and Aromatics and are treated, for the purposes of RMP, as a single process.  The process all starts in what is called the Olefins Unit, where plant feedstock is \"cracked\" in a furnace.  The feedstock is a mixture of naturally occurring hydrocarbons that range from natural gasoline, through gas well condensates, to heavy diesels.    In \"cracking\", the hydrocarbon chains are broken into shorter chains and in some cases recombined into even longer chains of hydrocarbons.  The result is a mixture of many hydrocarbons, which must be separated (and in some cases reacted with hydrogen) in order to become usable products.  The Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex manufactures the following products; Ethylene, Propylene, Ethane, Pyrolysis Gasoline, Heavy Aromatic Oil (HAO), Light Pyrolysis Oil, Pyrolysis Tar, Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), Raffinate I, Raffinate II, Resin Oil, Benzene, Butadiene, Mixed C"

In addition to these products, the following are used as feedstocks to the plant in making the products; Olefins Unit Feedstock as described above, Ethane, Butane, Drip Oils and Methanol.  The feedstocks are all transported to the facility by pipeline or barge and the products are transported from the facility by barge, pipeline or tank truck.\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent and mitigate possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Chocolate Bayou Mutual Aid Group which provides additional emergency response resources.\n\n4. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex encompasses Olefins and Aromatics manufacturing.  In the process of manufacturing these chemicals, some of which are regulated substances, we handle several flammable mixtures, comprising of eighteen (18) regulated flammable substances, and we utilize one (1) toxic regulated substance.  The eighteen (18) regulated flammable substances are: 1-3 Butadiene, Butane, Butene, Ethane, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isopentane, Isoprene, Methane, Methyl Butene, 1-3 Pentadiene, Pentane, Pentene, Propadiene, Propane, Propylene, and Vinyl Acetylene.  The one (1) toxic regulated substance is Chlorine used as a cooling water treatment chemical.\n\n5. The Worse-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternativ"

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nA.  Toxic Worse Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worse-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a catastrophic release of chlorine from a single one ton (2000 lb.) cylinder.  Chlorine is used as a cooling water treatment chemical in the two cooling towers in the Olefins and Aromatics manufacturing process.  The scenario assumes the complete loss of containment of a single storage cylinder of 2,000 pounds of chlorine as a liquid under pressure.  Under worse-case weather conditions, the maximum distance exceeds the plant fence line with an endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.  No administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account when estimating the maximum distance to the toxic end point.\n\nB.  Toxic Alternative Case Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release of chlorine from a <\" diameter hole in the liquid portion of the storage cylinder.  The release results in an estimated release rate of 160 lb./min. for 10 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions for this alternative release scenario, the maximum distance exceeds the plant fence line with an endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.  No administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account when estimating the maximum distance to the toxic end point. \n\nFor both toxic release scenarios, no credit was taken for active mitigation and emergency response actions that would normally occur to prevent or reduce the possible releases.  Such active mitigation measures that are in-place are: Chlorine detection system to a"

Chlorine is highly soluble in water so that a water spray can greatly limit the size of the toxic release.\n\nC.  Flammable Worse-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe first worse-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic release of a Olefins Unit feedstock storage tank in the Olefins and Aromatics manufacturing process.  The scenario assumes the complete loss of containment of 68,000,000 lb. of feedstock as a flammable mixture of hydrocarbons which vaporizes, finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worse-case weather conditions, the maximum distance exceeds the plant fence line with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  This scenario assumes that the standard administrative control of limiting the tank level to a maximum of 89% of the shell volume is in effect.\n\nThis first flammable worse-case scenario makes use of several assumptions that are required by the RMP rule for flammable mixtures.  It is assumed that the tank is filled entirely of the most flammable feedstock used.  This is a highly conservative assumption since such volatile feedstocks are normally blended with less volatile feedstocks to reduce the vapor pressure of the mixture to allow storage in an atmospheric tank.  Additionally, feedstock market supply conditions limit the availability of such volatile feedstocks, severely reducing the maximum amount of any volatile feedstock that could be pla"

      "SummaryText": "ced in a given tank.  These same volatile Olefins Unit feedstocks are a NFPA rated 4 flammable liquid, due to the rather high content of what are called \"light\" hydrocarbons.  These \"light\" hydrocarbons are the components of the mixture that are regulated flammable substances under the RMP rule.  Even though the \"light\" components of the mixture account for less than 32% of the mixture, for the purposes of consequence analysis, the entire mass of the mixture is treated as if it were a flammable regulated substance.  This RMP required treatment, of this particular flammable mixture, is thought to be very conservative.  Since all of the various Olefins Unit feedstocks are blended together with the specific intent to control the volatility of the mixture, it is highly improbable that the lightest feedstock would be allowed to fill an entire tank.  In the event of a catastrophic failure of an Olefins Unit feedstock tank, it is highly unlikely that sufficient heat and mass transfer could occur for the mixture to sufficiently vaporize the regulated flammable substances in a sufficient quantity to create a flammable vapor cloud explosion.  Due to the above RMP rule required assumptions and the very large size of the Olefins Unit feedstock storage tank, this worse-case scenario is several times larger than the next possible worse-case scenario.  From a physical chemistry perspective, the above worse-case scenario is not possible.  With the goal of presenting what is thought to be more technically accurate worse-case scenario, a second flammable worse-case scenario is also presented.\n\nThe second worse-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic release of Mixed C4's Hydrocarbon product from a storage sphere in the Olefins and Aromatics manufacturing process.  The scenario assumes the complete loss of containment of 7,800,000 lb. of Mixed C4's as a flammable mixture of pressurized liquid hydrocarbons which vaporizes, finds an ign"

Under worse-case weather conditions, the maximum distance exceeds the plant fence line with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  This scenario assumes that the standard administrative control of limiting the tank level to a maximum of 89% of the shell volume is in effect.  Since the entire product is a mixture of RMP regulated flammable substances, the potential to vaporize the material into a vapor cloud upon release is possible.\n\n\nD.  Flammable Alternative Case Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves the shaft seal failure of a barge loading pump for Butadiene product in the Olefins and Aromatics manufacturing process.  The scenario assumes the release of 320,000 lb. of Butadiene product as a flammable mixture of hydrocarbons which vaporizes, finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worse-case weather conditions, the maximum distance exceeds the plant fence line with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nFor the two worse-case flammable release scenarios and for the one alternative flammable release scenario, no credit was taken for active mitigation and emergency response actions that would normally occur to prevent or reduce the possible releases.

Five Year Accident History\n\nEquistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release of substances regulated by the RMP rule, in the last 5 years, that had an onsite or offsite impact as described under EPA 40 CFR Part 68.42(a).  As a matter of course, Equistar reports and investigates all incidents.  The number and severity of incidents has been declining for the last three years.  This decrease in number can be seen in the incidents that resulted in an OSHA recordable injury as listed below:\n\nYear  Number of Incidents  Recordable Injuries\n1994               5                                 5\n1995               6                                 6\n1996               0                                 0\n1997               0                                 0\n1998               1                                 1\n\nThe emphasis that all incidents are to be reported and investigated assists in improving all safety performance including accidental releases of regulated RMP substances.\n\n8.

Our CAN system is an automatic phone system that calls all neighbor phones with a recorded message that provides key actions to be taken in the event of an emergency.  The plant also has an online computer release modeling system called \"Safer\" which uses current meteorological data and chemical release information to predict the direction, distance and concentration of the release plume.  Additionally, the Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex has a program call Special Situations Plan (SSP) which is an emergency assistance program of plant personnel to the surrounding community.  The SSP is activated anytime an emergency could possibly have effects off the plant site.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response plans are periodically drilled and practiced.  Our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  And of course, the plan is reviewed and updated as needed to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n9.
