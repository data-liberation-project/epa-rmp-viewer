      "SummaryText": "2020 Risk Management Plan - City of Morganton. \r\n\r\n1. Executive Summary\r\nThe Catawba River Pollution Control Facility (CRPCF) is one of the many facilities owned and \r\noperated by the City of Morganton.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has an established Risk \r\nManagement Plan (RMP) in accordance with the EPA and OSHA regulatory requirements.  The WWTP \r\ncontinues the use of a chlorine gas process at this site and is required to file an updated RMP and \r\nresubmit their plan.  A brief overview of the RMP and the associated policies at the plant are described \r\nbelow. \r\n\r\n2. Facility Description and Regulated Substances  \r\nThe Pollution Control Facility treats the City of Morganton's wastewater prior to discharge into \r\nthe Catawba river.  The facility uses chlorine gas that is mixed with potable water and injected into \r\nwastewater stream to disinfect. Chlorine residual is maintained at appropriate levels to insure \r\ncompliance for Fecal Coliform.  \r\n2.1. The regulated substance handled at the wastewater treatment plant is chlorine and is stored in \r\n1-ton containers. \r\n2.2. Monitoring gas feed rate and chlorine residual samples are tested six times daily located at end \r\nof the chlorine contact chamber. \r\n2.3. At any given time, there are five containers onsite. \r\n2.4. The plant uses 60 - 80 lbs. per day. \r\n\r\n3. Prevention and Response Policies  \r\nThe City and the WWTP take an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its \r\nemployees are properly trained in the safe operation of processes and procedures, as well as the safe \r\nhandling of treatment chemicals.  The WWTP has established and maintains procedures for emergency \r\nnotification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to \r\naccommodate changes in staffing when they occur.  To increase employee safety and awareness, the \r\nWWTP Standard Operating Procedures include the following: \r\n3.1. Maintain up-to-date safety information and operating proce"

Conduct monthly safety SCBA/respirator training. \r\n3.5. Conduct annual drills and SCBA fitment testing.  \r\nThe WWTP has Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the three release scenarios which are \r\ndiscussed briefly in section 4.0.  These SOPs include guidance for conducting monthly safety training and \r\ndrills for employees.  A log of training and a record of observations are maintained by the Responsible \r\nOperator in Charge and the Safety Officer.  \r\nDuring the 2020 review process the team discussed and reviewed the PHA \"What if\" scenarios.  \r\nConsensus of the group chose to not regenerate the \"What if\" portion and will maintain it as part of this \r\nupdated RMP\r\n\r\n4. Prevention Steps for Chlorine  \r\nThe prevention program fulfills the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management \r\n(PSM) rule and the EPA RMP rule, and includes  \r\n4.1. Formal and on-the-job training. \r\n4.2. Written operating procedures. \r\n4.3. A process equipment preventive maintenance program.  \r\n\r\n5. Release Scenarios  \r\nThe WWTP personnel discussed and determined to focus on three (3) release scenarios.  \r\nThrough group meetings and review of current SOPs they created standalone SOPs for each of the \r\nscenarios.  The following are the selected scenarios:  \r\n5.1. Small leak. \r\n5.1.1.  Training and SOP were developed based on a small leak defined as a failed valve, loose \r\nconnection, or malfunction of existing equipment.  The quantity of the leak was derived \r\nfrom a loss of 52 lbs. or less of an amount of chlorine gas. \r\n5.2. Tank Rupture. \r\n5.2.1.  Training and SOP for a rupture was established using suppliers' tank specification and \r\ntheir definition of a rupture.  Furthermore... \r\n5.3. Fire during delivery/exchange . \r\n5.3.1.  Training and SOP based on this worst-case-scenario includes retrieval of personnel, \r\nnotification of emergency services, and"

Emergency Response Program  \r\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated \r\nwith the Morganton Public Safety Department.  The goals of the program are to protect on-site \r\nemployees from the hazardous effects of the releases and to minimize the effects of a release that \r\nwould be potentially hazardous to the residents.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to \r\nreflect personnel and regulatory changes.   \r\nLocal Emergency Operations procedures were reviewed. Points of contacts and level of \r\ninvolvement in the event of one of the above scenarios were determined.  To further reduce the risk to \r\nplant personnel, during normal operating hours, everyone will evacuate and ORC/BORC will liaison to \r\nthe Emergency Response Team (ERT).  During  after-hours/weekends/holidays, an operator will be the \r\nliaison to ERT while the ORC/BORC are in route to facility.    \r\n6.1.

Accident History  \r\nThere have been no reported accidents in the last five years.  There was a release of a small \r\namount of chlorine gas due to a failed regulating valve.  On early morning hours of May 30\r\n2018, approximately 30  pounds of the chlorine gas was slowly released due to a  failing  regulator valve.  The \r\nfollowing procedure was followed: \r\n7.1. Employees and construction workers were directed where to go during evacuation drill. \r\n7.2. Cylinder valves were immediately closed."

All employees and visitors were accounted for and no health issues were identified. \r\nNote:  This event took place under previous management personnel which have since retired from \r\ngovernment service. \r\n\r\n8. Planned Changes for Improved Safety  \r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings \r\nthat focus on safety issues are held regularly at the facility.  Employees trained to recognize hazards and \r\npresent ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.  \r\nDuring the development of this RMP document, a process hazard analysis of the chlorine system \r\nwas conducted with key employees to fulfill the prevention program requirements.  During these \r\nsessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental \r\nchemical releases.  Each recommendation will be or has been considered for implementation.  Though \r\nnot all recommendations may be implemented, the exercise provided all affected employees with a \r\nheightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes. \r\n8.1.
