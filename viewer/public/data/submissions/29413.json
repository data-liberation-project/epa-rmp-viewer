If an emerency involving formaldehyde were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Winnsboro Fire Department if outside assistance is necessary.               \n\nFacility Description & Regulated Substance:\nThis facility manufactures textile material which is supplied to other facilities for use in tire manufacturing.  Formaldehyde (37% solution) is an ingredient in a textile treatment dip solution which is applied to a woven fabric.  The formaldehyde process consists of one 5,000 gallon storage tank and associated equipment, which is located inside the manufacturing building.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario and More Likely Scenario:\nOur worst-case scenario is the release of the entire formaldehyde storage container.  In this scenario, the release would be mitigated by both diking and the building.  According to EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables, a release of this caliber could result in a very limited hazard zone of up to only 528 ft, which could impact some of our nearest neighbors.  However, considering the location of the tank inside the building and the spill prevention and response program in place at the facility, a release of this nature is highly unlikely.  It is much more reasonable to assume that such a release would be averted through operator intervention and that it would be totally contained within the building.\nThe more likely scenario, if there were any incident, would be a small release from a hose failure when offloading the material from the delivery tanker.  According to EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables, a release of this caliber could result in a very limited hazard zone of up to only 528 ft, which could possibly impact some of our nearest neighbors.  However, considering the precautions that are taken by personnel during the offloading pro"

      "SummaryText": "cess and the spill prevention and response program in place at the facility, a release of this nature is unlikely to actually occur.  The facility has never experienced a hose failure.\n\n(Please note: Due to an inherent problem with the RMP Submit software, the actual release rate of 0.02    could not be reported as such.  Instead the software forces a default of 0.2).\n\nPrevention Program:\nThis facility complies with EPA's Risk Management rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  Additionally, the storage tank and process are located inside the building to prevent releases to the environment.  The process is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with OSHA's PSM and good engineering practices.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\nWe have never had an accident involving formaldehyde that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nOur facility has a spill prevention and response procedure in place, which includes employee training and coordination with local emergency response.  In the event of an emergency requiring assistance, it is our policy to notify the Winnsboro Municipal and Fairfield County  Fire Departments and request that they respond to the emergency.  This policy has been discussed with the fire departments."
