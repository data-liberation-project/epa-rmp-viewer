It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nOur Emergency response program was originally deveoped in 1999 with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, inc and has since been reviewed and the emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Mountain Home Fire Department, then the notification of the Director of Water & Wastewater Services, then notification of the Baxter County 911 System for 911 call-out to the affected population.  The Mountain Home Fire Department and Mountain Home Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted systems.  The 911 Ststem will also notify Baxter County Offices of Emergency Services. \n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the Wastewater system by utilizing the chemicals (Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide) for disinfection and dechlorination to the wastewater system.  Chlorine is received in by individual one ton cylinders at the 527 Hicks road location and stored until needed.  Chlorine is fed into the wastewater system by automatic feeders at the beginn"

Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substances handled at the 537 Hicks Road location are Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  The maximum amount of Chlorine on hand at any one time is 8000 lbs.  The maximim amount of Sulfur Dioxide on hand at any one time is 8000 lbs. \n\n2 cylinders are connected online with only 1 cylinder feeding at a time, an automatic switchover valve is connected to the system that allows the feeding cylinder to switch to the second cylinder when the first tank empties.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failue of our largest storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed, would release 2000 lbs of Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide from the chlorine storage area at 537 Hicks Road location.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.  This location is classified as urban due to the thickly populated trees and steep hilly terrain around the site.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario was determined for this facility; based upon the type of prevention system in place, the alternative release from a one ton cylinder would be unlikely for the 537 Hicks road site.  The cylinders that are connected for feeding are in a totally enclosed rooms are on a vacuum system which is determined to be effective in preventing small amounts of chlorine from excaping upon a system failure.  An estimation, if a release occurred during cylinder change-out, would be approximately 10 pounds into the atomosphere.  This amount of vapor release would result"
