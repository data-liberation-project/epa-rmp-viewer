The SCR system is capable of reducing NOx emissions \nby approximately 25,000 tons per year during the 12 months of continuous operation.  \nThis NOx reduction provides a substantial benefit to the ambient air quality in terms of \nreduced ground level ozone concentrations.  An integral part of the SCR system is the \nstorage and on-site transfer of anhydrous ammonia used as a reagent that reduces NOx \nemissions.  Anhydrous ammonia is regulated under U.S. EPA's Accident Release \nPrevention Program (40 CFR Part 68). Because anhydrous ammonia will be present in the \nSCR process in quantities well in excess of the 10,000 lb. threshold, the SCR process is \nsubject to ARP regulations. \nThe Homer City generating station also utilizes relatively small quantities of anhydrous \nammonia in the electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to enhance the control of particulate \nmatter. The ESP process is capable of being supplied anhydrous ammonia from the main \nanhydrous storage tanks and therefore is subject to the risk management regulation.  \nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless liquid or gas which is readily detectable by its \nextremely pungent odor.  In sufficient concentrations, anhydrous ammonia is an eye, \nskin, and/or inhalation irritant.  For this reason, anhydrous ammonia is regulated under \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management \nStandard at 29 CFR Part 1910.119 and the U.S. EPA risk management rule at 40 CFR \nPart 68.\nFor ammonia processes, the threshold quantity for coverage under 40 CFR Part 68 is \n10,000 lbs.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the site via tank truck and stored above-\nground in three horizontally oriented cylindrical pressure vessels, with a combined \nstorage capacity of 657,000 lbs (at 85% fill level).  Shipping and transfer of ammonia to \nthe pressure vessels is carried out by trained qualified personnel provided by the vendor, \nusing standard operating procedures that have been thoroughly reviewed"

The procedures minimize routine release of residual \nammonia in the transfer hose by purging ammonia from the transfer hose back into the \ntransport trailer. Ammonia is pumped from the storage area to the SCR area where it is \nvaporized, mixed with heated air and injected into the flue gas, which is then \nimmediately passed through a catalyst material.  The reaction in the presence of the \ncatalyst reduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) mixture to nitrogen (N2) \nand water vapor (H2O).  \nThe U.S. EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for \nindustrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a \n\u00bfsignificant\u00bf release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the \nRMPlan submittal date and for which the worst-case release does not affect \u00bfpublic \nreceptors\u00bf (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facilities, \nhospitals).  Given that the SCR process contains substantial quantities of ammonia that \nif released could affect public receptors, it does not qualify for Program 1.  Program 2 \napplies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.  \nProgram 3 applies to processes, such as those present at the Homer City facility, which \nare subject to the OSHA PSM.

For that \nreason, both the results for the standardized worst-case defined by the U.S. EPA \nmethods and an alternative case, which is considered by EME Homer City Generation L. \nP. to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the \nlifetime of the facility, are presented and described.  \nAs noted, the Homer City Generation Station has used anhydrous ammonia in the ESPs \nsince 1998.  No accidental release of ammonia has resulted in reportable on-site injury, \noff-site injury, emergency response, or damage to property or the environment.  To ensure \nthat mitigation measures and emergency response plans are appropriate, potential \nrelease scenarios are considered.

These include: \n*Process Safety Information\n*Process Hazards Analysis\n*Standard Operating Procedures\n*Training Programs for Operators and Risk Management Training for all Employees\n*Mechanical Integrity and Preventive Maintenance Program\n*Management of Change Program\n*Pre-startup Review Procedures\n*Incident Investigation and Follow-up Procedures\n*Safety Procedures for Contractors\n*Employee Participation Program\n*Hot Work Permits\nIn addition to these programs, EME Homer City Generation L.P. has designed and \nconstructed the SCR system to meet stringent safety requirements.  These include:\n*Continuous surveillance of tank truck unloading\n*Pressure relief devices to prevent catastrophic fai"

This means that that there has been no incident \nresulting in the sudden release of ammonia that has caused on-site or off-site injury, \nsignificant on-site damage, or any off-site emergency response or injury.   In conjunction \nwith the current ARP and PSM programs in place at the EME Homer City Generation L.P. \nfacility, there is a standard management practice that requires immediate internal reporting \nof unusual events, including those in which any abnormal emission of regulated chemicals \nis observed or suspected.  The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a \ndetermination is made as to whether a reportable quantity on any chemical listed as \nrequiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved. If so, the appropriate authorities are \npromptly notified.\n6.0   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nIt is the policy of the EME Homer City Generation L.P. to place the highest priority on \nemployee safety and health and on protection of the community from all plant-induced \nenvironmental conditions. Experience has shown that proper planning and an organized \napproach will reduce the effects of emergency events.  Prompt internal and external \ncommunications, emergency equipment, and trained personnel are the key ingredients of \nthis plan.  EME Homer City Generation L.P.\u00bfs policy provides"

Both the advanced planning aspects of \nprocess design, operating procedures, emergency preparedness, and the operational \nelements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training \nare necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  These programs are \nall documented so that needed information about the safe handling of all chemicals \npresent at the facility is continuously available to employees."
