ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\n  At this George's facility, we utilize \"Anhydrous Ammonia\" that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions. George's strives to protect all valuable assets and resources such as personnel and property. We have families and friends in this community and are invested in safety for everyone. We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.\n\n  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State and local regulations. Through continual training, various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize the potential for releases.\n\n  Our emergency response program has specific procedures for responding to fire, severe weather and accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. We work in conjunction with area fire departments and the Barry-Lawrence County Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n  The primary purpose of our facility is the processing of chickens for use as refrigerated or frozen food. We utilize Anhydrous Ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing. Our normal inventory of anhydrous ammonia for operations meets the PSM/RMP threshold, thus we maintain PSM/RMP Programs for safety and compliance.\n\n  Access to the site and refrigeration system are restricted and limited for security purposes. Only authorized contractors or employees with proper training and clearance may work on or near the refrigeration system. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n In the last five years this facility has had small releases of ammonia, but has not suffer"

THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n  The management of the RMP Program is handled by the Complex PSM Coordinator, with the assistance of the Refrigeration Manager, the Safety Manager and the Corporate Environmental Manager. This group of individuals work together to maintain the RMP Program and the Refrigeration System in a compliant and safe manner.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Barry-Lawrence County Local Emergency Planning District and area fire departments.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\n  This George's facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule. Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard\n\nCommunication Training and through access to our written programs. The ammonia system is operated, tested, and maintained to the standard of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the most stringent standards of the industry. \n\n\n\n\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n  George's Inc., has onsite Hazardous Materials trained personnel to immediately respond to adverse conditions. This helps minimize the potential of an off-site release.  \n\n  We work closely with the Barry-Lawrence County Local Emergency Planning District and area fire departments on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n\n\n"
