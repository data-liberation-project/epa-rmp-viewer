The Borough of Carlisle Sewer Authority owns the Carlisle Region Water Pollution\n\n     Control Facility which is operated by the Borough of Carlisle.  Its service area includes\n\n     Carlisle, county seat for Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, and some surrounding\n\n     communities.   The wastewater treatment plant,  located at 54 North Middlesex Road, north\n\n     of U.S. 11 in Middlesex Township, processes up to 7 million gallons per day of wastewater\n\n     and discharges under  NPDES permit PA 0026077 to the Conodoguinet Creek.   Wastewater\n\n     treatment processes include grit and coarse screenings removal, preliminary sedimentation,\n\n     secondary activated sludge treatment, clarification, and disinfection.  Solid material\n\n     removed from this process is digested to inert material that is used as fertilizer in\n\n     agricultural operations.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, every day of the year.\n\n\n\n          b.          The wastewater treatment plant includes a disinfection system.  Comprising it are\n\n     a chlorine container room, which contains three (3) one-ton containers of chlorine liquified\n\n     under pressure, and a chlorinator room containing, chlorinators,  various safety equipment,\n\n     and instrumentation consisting of automated chlorine/flow recorders, electrical panels, and \n\n     gas detector/alarm units.  Up to three (3) one-ton containers may be on-site simultaneously. \n\n     The automated chlorinator system extracts about 50 to 120 pounds per day of chlorine gas\n\n     from the storage containers through remote vacuum regulators and dissolves this gas in\n\n     water to form a disinfection solution that is used to kill pathogenic bacteria in treated\n"

Treatment plant operators regularly check\n\n     the rooms and equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and if required manually\n\n     adjusting the rate as necessary.

The Carlisle Region Water Pollution Control Facility's accidental release prevention\n\n     program is based upon the following elements:\n\n                   1)  High level of training for the operators.\n\n                   2)  Preventative maintenance program for equipment.\n\n                   3)  Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n                        4)  Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation\n\n             of the operators.\n\n                   5)  Performance of a hazard review of the equipment and procedures.\n\n                   6)  Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\n          Chemical-specific prevention st"

No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n          e.     The facility has an emergency response program which has been reviewed and\n\n     coordinated by the Cumberland County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in\n\n     Carlisle and by the Carlisle area fire companies and the Cumberland County HAZMAT\n\n     Response Team.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a\n\n     notification plan.  Emergency response drills have been conducted with the fire companies,\n\n     and the operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated on a regular basis.\n\n\n\n          f.         Changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were made following a February\n\n     4, 1999, inspection of the disinfection systems by the Borough's consulting engineer.  These\n\n     recommendations included third-party training of all water plant employees in chlorine\n\n     usage and safety, done on June 2, 1999.  Other considerations possible are the replacement\n\n     of high-pressure gas lines on the chlorinator with remote vacuum-demand type regulators\n\n     and the addition of a security system to prevent unauthorized entries. The remote vacuum\n\n     type regulators were installed and put into service on May 1, 2000. The security system will\n\n     be studied under the pending Vulnerability Assessment of the Wastewater Treatment Facility\n\n     per Public Law #107188 - Public Health Security and Bio-Terrorism Preparedness and\n\n     Response Act of 2002."
