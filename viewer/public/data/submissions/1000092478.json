ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nThe top priority of Dickinson Frozen Foods facility is to provide a healthy and safe work environment\n\nfor its employees and the surrounding community. In this effort, the facility has developed strict\n\npolicies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release. The\n\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\n\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR\n\n1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been\n\nintegrated. Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on\n\nemergency planning and response. It is the commitment of management and employees to follow\n\nthe established procedures and seek new ways for improvement.\n\n\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Dickinson Frozen Foods facility is located in Fruitland, Idaho. The facility operates two\n\nindependent systems at this location using Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) as the\n\nrefrigerant in the closed-loop systems. The total combined ammonia inventory exceeds the threshold\n\nquantity for accidental release prevention.\n\n\n\nC. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nEPA's Risk Management Prevention Program 3, 40 CFR Part 68(D) and OSHA's Process Safety\n\nManagement Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 outline the facilities accidental release prevention program\n\nbelow. The facility has committed to completing audits and inspections as well as holding employee\n\nmeetings to establish current procedures, ensure there is employee buy in for procedures and seek\n\nnew opportunities for improvement to health and safety policies. The system has many built-in safety\n\nfeatures including high-level controls and indicators, pressure"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable releases.\n\n\n\nE. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDickinson Frozen Foods is using Caldwell Fire Department as the first responder to an incident in\n\nthe event of an uncontrolled release. The facility has developed an Emergency Action plan to ensure\n\nan efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous substance release, fire, explosion or\n\nany other emergency. The plan includes First Aid procedures and Emergency Medical Treatment\n\nprocedures, Evacuation plans, Notification/Communication.\n\n\n\nF. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDickinson Frozen Foods is proactive in their approach to health and safety of its employees and\n\nsurrounding community. Any areas of improvement that can be identified in audits, hazard analyses\n\nand inspections are identified, and corrective actions are taken in the event a recommendation is\n\nmade promptly."
