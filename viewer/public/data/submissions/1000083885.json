The syngas is further purified and separated into Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide. CO is then compressed and routed to Celanese for use in their acetic acid unit, and the hydrogen is compressed and sent to the Linde pipeline. The plant was started in 2019 and is subject to 29 CFR1919.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA. The chemical is:\n\n- Flammable mixture containing hydrogen, methane, and other components, manufactured on site.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.\n\n\n\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\"                            \n\n\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Clear Lake.

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n-At this location we have field mounted fire alarm control systems which tie into the central control unit that will alarm and indicate the location of the problem.\n\n-Fire extinguishers are located in key areas of the plant. They are maintained monthly and undergo yearly inspections by an outside vendor.\n\n- Plant operation emergency shutdowns (if process variable is exceeded) will shutdown the Plant and isolate the process.
