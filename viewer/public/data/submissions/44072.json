Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of South Central Coop/ Chariton (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage, handling and sale of fertilizers to local farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received sold and distributed for application as a crop production nutrient. The ammonia is stored in two (2) steel tanks, 1 @ 30,000 gallons capacity and 1 @ 18,000 gallons capacity as well as 32 - 1,000 gallon steel nurse tanks. The maximum quantity stored is estimated to be about 350,200 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios:  A) The Worst Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank (30,000 gallons) as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released is estimated to be about 131,325 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85 % capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is estimated to be about 2.6 miles.  B) The Alternate Case Release Scenario, based on the 5 year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a 3 transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released is estimated to be about 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is estimated to be about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:"

      "SummaryText": "The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and the standards of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. \n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries,evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has:  A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
