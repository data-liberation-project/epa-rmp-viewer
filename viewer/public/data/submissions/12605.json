The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Propane.  In this scenario 970600 lb. of Propane is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.80 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Propane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 111317.89 lb. of Propane in 10 minutes. The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include Water Cannons.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.24 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Normal Pentane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 39532.72 lb. of Pentane in 10 minutes.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include Water Cannons.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.18 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Isobutane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 48765.28 lb. of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] in 10 minutes.
