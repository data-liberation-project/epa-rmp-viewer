The facility utilizes\nanhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of fluid milk within the facility.  Anhydrous\nammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia\nia normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquified under pressure.  The refrigerant system\nconsists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping and valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  Country Fresh is committed to promoting safety\nfor the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety\nManagement Standard (PMS), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management\nProgram regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration\nsystem is operating safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs\nserve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate\nemergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  As a part of its PSM program,\nCountry Fresh has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  These\nprograms include:\n\n- Process safety information\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n- Employee Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-startup review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Works Permits\n- Contractor Safety\n\nEmergency Response Information:  As a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response\nPlan that was prepared "

      "SummaryText": "in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliablity\nof actions taken during an incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid\nand medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies, as well as the public.  In the\nevent of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as\nnecessary by calling 911, Genesee County LEPC, Police, Sheriff Department, Fire Department and Young's\nEnviromental.\n\nFive year accident history:  Country Fresh has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the\nlast 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this time.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety:  Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various\nelements of our accidental release prevention program.  The most important of these are increased employee\ntraining, preventive maintenance and timely inspections.  \n\nIn addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will\ncontinue to implement its OSHA PMS Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program."
