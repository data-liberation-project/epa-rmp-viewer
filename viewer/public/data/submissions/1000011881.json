We operate our business in a manner that consciously safeguards our employees, customers and communities in which we do business.  In striving for responsible environmental, health & safety (EH&S) stewardship, Zeeland Generating Station pledges to:\n\n*  Diligently develop, construct and operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes pollution prevention and places the highest priority on health and safety.\n\n*  Operate facilities and respond to emergency conditions in a manner that meets or exceeds all applicable federal, state and local EH&S rules, regulations, ordinances and statutes as well as recognized industry guidelines and standards.\n\n*  Continually measure, evaluate and improve our EH&S performance.\n\n*  Promote EH&S awareness that fosters a caring, ownership-driven culture among employees, contractors and vendors.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Consumers Energy Company-Zeeland Generating Station, located in Zeeland, Michigan, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity.  To reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from the gas-fired combustion turbines, aqueous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams.  Aqueous ammonia is stored on site in a dedicated, specially-designed storage tank.  The storage capacity of the tank exceeds the threshold quantity for Risk Management Program (RMP) applicability.  There are no other toxic or flammable substances on site that exceed RMP thresholds.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis\nAs required by the RMP rule, we have analyzed the off-site consequences of a hypothetical, worst-case, ammonia release scenario.  This scenario is the highly unlikely catastrophic rupture of the ammonia storage tank.  The release duration is ten minutes.  The 12,000-gallon tank is limited"

We also account for secondary containment because it is passive mitigation, but we may not account for the water fogging system because it is active mitigation.  We analyzed the consequences of such a release into secondary containment, using weather conditions defined by the RMP rule and an EPA-approved toxics dispersion model.  The results, including affected public and environmental receptors, are reported herein.\n\nThe RMP rule also requires an analysis of the offsite consequences of an alternative accidental release scenario.  The RMP rule requires us to report an alternative release scenario that causes an off-site concentration of ammonia of at least 0.14 mg/L, if one exists.  We have not been able to identify many alternative scenarios that meet this requirement.  However, we were able to conceive one such scenario, alternative scenario 1.  Alternative scenario 2 is considered more realistic because it includes the operation of the active mitigation system.  We have reported two alternative scenarios: (1) the unlikely scenario in which the ammonia storage catastrophically ruptures and the water fogging system fails to operate, and (2) the more likely scenario in which an ammonia tank loading hose ruptures and the water fogging system does operate.  The first of these scenarios is identical to the worst-case scenario, except that weather conditions, defined by the RMP rule for alternative scenarios, are more realistic.  We have analyzed the consequences of these hypothetical releases, using weather conditions conforming to the RMP rule and an EPA-approved toxics dispersion model.  The results, including affected public and environmental receptors, are reported herein.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nZeeland Generating Station is subject to the Program 2 Prevention Program of the RMP rule.

Although anhydrous (gaseous) ammonia is often used for this application, Zeeland Generating Station has chosen to use aqueous ammonia for its inherently safer properties.  Zeeland Generating Station has performed a hazard review of the ammonia storage and feed system to ensure design measures for prevention have been included.  Zeeland Generating Station has designed check valves, flow control valves and shutoff valves into the system.  Zeeland Generating Station has provided secondary containment for all equipment in ammonia service containing more than a negligible quantity.  Secondary containment limits the spread of accidentally released ammonia.  Zeeland Generating Station has also invested in a state-of-the-art water fogging system dedicated to reducing ammonia exposuresA?due to accidental releasesA?far below safety standards both on and off site.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nZeeland Generating Station began combined-cycle operation (requiring the use of aqueous ammonia) in 2002.  There have been no RMP reportable releases at the plant since operation began.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nZeeland Generating Station maintains a written emergency response program and routinely trains staff in its procedures.  The program addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, spill response measures, notification of emergency response agencies and the public in the event of a release.
