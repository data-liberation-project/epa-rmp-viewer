      "SummaryText": "Facility Background and Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\n\n\nAt the Egbert WY facility we handle propane that is recognized by the EPA as a regulated, flammable substance.  The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents.  First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  AmeriGas also has nine Regional Logistics Managers, a Director of Terminals, a Regulatory Compliance Manager and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident.  AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country.  Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.   \n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute propane to AmeriGas retail facilities and wholesale customers.  Propane is received by rail cars then distributed to the customers by truck transports. Access to the site is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and contractors by the use of perimeter fencing and controlled gate access.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Practices\n\n\n\nThe site and the company continually strive to"

Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.  The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices.  The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via extensive inspection and painting programs.  \n\n\n\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, emergency shutdown systems and portable fire extinguishers are also available on site.  The emergency shutdown systems include the ability to activate via remote control, positive shutoff valves designed to shutdown the affected equipment or isolate a problem once it is detected.  \n\n\n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals.  In addition, the site complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state and local codes.  When built, this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58.  \n\n\n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers are trained in the terminal's loading & emergency action plan procedures and future plans include driver certification using the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\n\nOff site Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nFor flammables, vapor cloud explosion is specified as worst case scenario.

Per CFR 68.25.b.1, \"For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\" is the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe greatest amount of propane held is 30,000 Gallons or 110,000 lbs. The total quantity released was 110,000 lbs. The propane was assumed to disperse in the flammable range, encounter areas of sufficient congestion and confinement and result in a vapor cloud explosion. Using EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst case distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nAssumption\n\nRMP assumes meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario of atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour). Ambient air temperature assumed is 25 deg C (77 deg F). TNT-equivalent model is used which assumes a yield factor of 10 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlernative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nFor alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was chosen. The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. The calculated distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\n\n\n\nBroken or burst propane loading hoses were determined to be the most common failure. Pumps and Compressors were also considered. Maintenance and mitigation devices are in place that would mitigate the risks of release from pumps and compressors. Vessel overfilling is mitigated administratively. The storage tanks are filled only to a maximum of 85% of the total capacity to allow expansion of the product.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had an accident or release meeting RMP criteria within the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThough the site is classified as a non-responding facility, it maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP"

Notification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel.  Should as actual incident occur, the plans give guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site.  Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.  \n\n\n\nThe plans are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response.  The  EAP is based upon the following guidelines and standards:\n\n\n\n1) NPGA LP-Gas Safety Handbooks:  Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and How To Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\n\n2) OSHA's Occupational Safety and Health Standards for General Industry, specifically: 29 CFR 1910.38,Emergency Action Plans,29CFR 1910.39,Fire Prevention Plans,29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and 29 CFR 1910.120,Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.\n\n3) National Fire Protection Association Guidelines, NFPA 58,Liquified Petroleum Gas Code and NFPA 54 National Fuel Gas Code.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe facility has no plans at the present time to make any changes.\n\n"
