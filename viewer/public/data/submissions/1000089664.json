Employees receive training in these actions and procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The ERP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. Changes to the ERP are communicated to the personnel assigned to emergency response and training is provided if necessary.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for HF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery is coordinated with the Skagit County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  HF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, HF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop action items that may help prevent a recurrence of the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for review. Actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, HF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

HF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nHF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help maintain worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nHF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be reviewed pursuant to the MOC process before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) addressing findings identified, if any, during inspections and tests, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to help maintain their skills and knowledge.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.\n\nContractors\n\nHF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, HF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

For example, as a general rule, high risk findings are resolved within one year or less, unless the resolution of the finding requires a unit or plant shutdown to complete, or other conditions limit the ability of the plant to resolve the open finding.  Medium risk findings are completed at the next convenient opportunity and low risk items are evaluated and proceed at the discretion of refinery management.\n\nHF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. Electronic tracking systems are used to manage and document the results and findings from these updates, all approved mitigation options being implemented in response to the PHA team findings, and the final resolution of each finding.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nHF Sinclair Puget Sound Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.
