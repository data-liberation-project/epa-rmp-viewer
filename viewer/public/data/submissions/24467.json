BASF also believes in being a responsible corporate citizen and maintaining open, constructive dialogue with our neighbors.  These principles are an integral part of our corporate vision statement and values.  We believe that sharing this information with our neighbors makes good sense.  By doing so, we believe the community will better understand how safe and ecologically sound BASF operations are.\n\nPolicies\n\nBASF Corporation has the following Corporate Guidelines related to environmental, health and safety:\n\n? We produce products that are safe to manufacture, use and dispose of.\n? We assist our customers to use our products safely and in an environmentally sound manner.  We provide them with information on correct handling of our products.\n? We minimize the impact on mankind and the environment during production, storage, transportation, marketing and use of our products.\n? Economic considerations do not take priority over environmental protection, health and safety.\n? An important contribution to \"Sustainable Development\" is our involvement in the \"Responsible Care\" initiative worldwide.  This applies to our products and services in all our businesses and affiliates.\n? We are committed to making continuous improvements in safety, health and environmental protection.  We do this acting on our own initiative and in consultation with recognized regulatory authorities.  We take any action judged to be necessary, whether or not dictated by statutory obligation or official regulations.\n? We encourage safety, environmental and health awareness among employees.\n?

Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Washington, NJ Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Washington, NJ Site uses ethylene oxide (EO), propylene oxide (PO), and ethylenediamine (EDA).  These chemicals are used to manufacture products such as toothpaste, mouthwashes, wastewater treatment (defoamers), fuel additives, detergents, and agricultural chemicals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\n? Gas release of ethylene oxide with off-site impact.\n\nAlternative\n\n? Flange gasket leak of ethylene oxide with off-site impacts. \n? Flange gasket leak of propylene oxide with off-site impacts.\n? Flange gasket leak of ethylenediamine with off-site impacts.  A dike is taken into consideration as passive mitigation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code, and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe  Prevention Act.\n\nSignificant chemical-specific prevention steps that are found at the facility include:\n? Being prepared to handle unexpected rises in temperature and pressure by using automatic shut-off device and relief valves.\n? Multiple layers of protections such as safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutdown systems and leak detectors.\n? Identifying potential problems by continuously monitoring pressure in vessels and piping.\n? Ensuring proper operation by regularly inspecting equipment.  \n? Ensuring staff and contractors receive extensive emergency response, health care and safety training following regulatory and corporate guidelines.\n? Training staff in start-"

The release occurred from a pump transferring dilute ethylene oxide.  As corrective action, pumps that transfer ethylene oxide no longer use packing glands.  Although an evacuation of the surrounding neighbors was taken as precautionary measure, there was no adverse impact to the community or BASF employees.\n\nPropylene Oxide:  This facility has had no accidental release over the past five years which meets the reporting criteria.\n\nEthylenediamine:  This facility has had no accidental release over the past five years which meets the reporting criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  Hazmat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly.\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program which consists of:\n? Establishing a team of emergency responders who have completed required training.\n? Conducting annual emergency exercises for emergency responders.\n? An emergency response plan which is located on-site and copies distributed to local fire and police departments, hospitals, and emergency management centers.\n?

This facility believes that an employee's suggestions should be strongly considered because of their detailed knowledge in the operation of the equipment.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted prior to commissioning of any equipment after changes are made.  This ensures that all potential deviations from normal operating parameters are evaluated and corrective actions taken if necessary.\n\nIncident investigations are performed to understand the reasons why, when, how, and what occurred during the incident.  From the investigations, long-term corrective actions are implemented to ensure the least chance of reoccurrence.  \n\nSome past changes that have been implemented to improve safety include:\n? Switching to gaskets that are more resistant to corrosive materials.\n? Pumps which transfer ethylene oxide and propylene oxide no longer use packing glands.\n? Increasing the number of stationary combustible gas detectors.  \n? Readiness for the Year 2000 (Y2K) potential computer bug.\n? Connecting all stack emissions for ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and ethylenediamine to a central control device which decreases the emissions to the atmosphere."
