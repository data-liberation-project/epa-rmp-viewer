Although an evacuation of the surrounding neighbors was taken as precautionary measure, there was no adverse impact to the community or BASF employees.\n\nPropylene Oxide:  This facility has had no accidental release over the past five years which meets the reporting criteria.\n\nEthylenediamine:  This facility has had no accidental release over the past five years which meets the reporting criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  Hazmat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly.\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program which consists of:\n\u00b7 Establishing a team of emergency responders who have completed required training.\n\u00b7 Conducting annual emergency exercises for emergency responders.\n\u00b7 An emergency response plan which is located on-site and copies distributed to local fire and police departments, hospitals, and emergency management centers.\n\u00b7 Arrangements with local fire department to familiarize themselves with the site.\n\u00b7 Having stationary emergency response equipment such as emergency shutdown instruments, combustible vapor detectors, adequate fire water and fire sprinklers.\n\u00b7 Having portable emergency response equipment such as walkie-talkies, personal protective equipments (PPE's), absorbent"

      "SummaryText": "materials, combustible vapor detectors, and fire extinguishers.\n\u00b7 Training in proper first aid and medical treatment.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and others.\n\nEmployee's suggestions are encouraged and evaluated for its feasibility.  This facility believes that an employee's suggestions should be strongly considered because of their detailed knowledge in the operation of the equipment.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted prior to commissioning of any equipment after changes are made.  This ensures that all potential deviations from normal operating parameters are evaluated and corrective actions taken if necessary.\n\nIncident investigations are performed to understand the reasons why, when, how, and what occurred during the incident.  From the investigations, long-term corrective actions are implemented to ensure the least chance of reoccurrence.  \n\nSome past changes that have been implemented to improve safety include:\n\u00b7 Switching to gaskets that are more resistant to corrosive materials.\n\u00b7 Pumps which transfer ethylene oxide and propylene oxide no longer use packing glands.\n\u00b7 Increasing the number of stationary combustible gas detectors.  \n\u00b7 Readiness for the Year 2000 (Y2K) potential computer bug.\n\u00b7 Connecting all stack emissions for ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and ethylenediamine to a central control device which decreases the emissions to the atmosphere."
