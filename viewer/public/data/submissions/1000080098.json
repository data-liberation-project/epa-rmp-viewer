The Springfield Water and Sewer Commission has prepared and updated this accident release prevention program in response to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule as promulgated and amended (January 13, 2017 - 82 FR 4696) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The Commission has followed the procedures set forth in the rule and utilized guidance materials provided by EPA.  In addition, an emergency action plan relating to an accidental chlorine release at the West Parish Filters (WPF) Drinking Water Treatment Plant outlines emergency action procedures at the plant and coordination with local emergency response services.\n\n\n\nB.  The stationary source this RMP applies to is the chlorination facility located at the WPF Drinking Water Treatment Plant in Westfield, Massachusetts.  The RMP regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine which is used for primary disinfection of the finished drinking water.  The chlorine building is comprised of two separate rooms: (1) a chlorine handling room containing six one ton cylinders with vacuum regulators, scales, electric hoist, chlorine gas sensor alarms, automatic switchover and manual ventilation system, and (2) a chlorination room housing six floor mounted gas regulators, ejectors, chlorine gas sensor alarms and feed water pipes.  A secure pad adjacent to the building provides space for additional inventory and empty cylinder storage.  During normal operations four cylinders are connected, two on-line and two on stand-by, a third set of tanks with manual control is kept on standby and is used when demand is high.  \n\n\n\nC.  The chlorination process at the WPF has historically been considered an EPA RMP Program 2 Level process because the WPF's employees were not subject to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.  (29 CFR 1910.119) through the United States Department of Labor.  However, with the enactment of Massachusetts bill H.3952 as of February 1, 2019 public sector"

      "SummaryText": " employees are now required to meet the minimum requirements provided under OSHA through oversight and enforcement by the Massachusetts Department of Labor Standards (DLS) so the covered process now falls under RMP Program Level 3.  \n\n\n\nD. The general accident release program is comprised of several interrelated elements.  The operators have received a high level of training through on the job instruction, attendance of appropriate mandatory courses and seminars, and a mandatory certified on-site refresher course given by the facility's chlorine supplier vendor annually.  The operators follow a preventative maintenance program to avert sudden equipment breakdowns.  Written operating procedures are available to the operators.  The most recent hazard review of equipment and review of safety procedures was performed in June 2017.  Full face respirators are worn by facility personnel during cylinder change outs.  Training is conducted for all on-site employees concerning the awareness of the hazardous properties of chlorine and for the chlorine sensor alarm systems which incorporate both audible and visual alarms at the storage site as well as the plant's main computer alarm system. The chemical feed system was last upgraded in 2014 in conjunction with an upgrade to the SCADA system.  \n\n\n\nD.  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the facility in the previous five years (June 2014 to June 2019).\n\n\n\nE.  The treatment plant has an emergency action plan which provides both plant and community response personnel contact numbers.  The Westfield Fire Department provides annual site visits to review and update its emergency information.  The Westfield Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Westfield Health Department are provided a copy of this plan.  The most recent emergency response exercise was held on December 27, 2018 to familiarize and update facility personnel and community first responders with emergency response procedures.

Personnel are trained to the NIMS IS-700 and ICS 100 level.  Supervisory personnel have been trained to the ICS-200 level.  Monthly communications drills are conducted between facility control room staff and the Westfield 911 center via a two-way radio.\n\n\n\nF.
