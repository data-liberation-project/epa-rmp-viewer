If an accidental release occurs, we are prepared to work with the Chattanooga Volunteer Fire Department, and other appropriate response and regulatory agencies, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on the community and the environment.\n\n2.  Basic Information \n\nL & L Farm Supply is a full-service farm supply operation.  Our primary activities include selling feed, equipment parts, fertilizer, pesticides, and other supplies to locxal farmers.  We also provide custom application of fertilizer and pesticides.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a Nitrogen Fertilizer for crop production.  The  maximum capacity of anhydrous ammonia stored at any given time is 110,000 pounds in two 12,000 gallon storage tanks.\n\n3.  Worst-case and Alternative-release Scenario\n\nA.  The worst-case release scenario would encompass the release of total contents of one 12,000 gallon storage tank, as a gas under pressure, in a period of 10 minutes.  Released quantity would consist of 56,000 pounds, which is the maximum allowable filling capacity.  The affected area encompasses a circle with the tank at the center, and a radius of .74 miles.  The concentration of anhydrous ammonia in the affected area should be less than 200 parts per million.\n\nB.  The alternative-release scenario (most likely accident to occur) is a release resulting from a ruptured transfer hose.  Approximately 7,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia would be released, affecting a circle with a radius of .33 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention program\n\nWe take extensive precautions to preclude accidental releases.  We have implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standar"

Five-year Accident History\n\nTo our knowledge, there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; nor that have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response program\n\nWe are prepared to react quickly in an organized manner in the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia.  We have a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38, outlining the specific actions to be taken in response to an emergency. We have also provided state and local authorities all information required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA), SARA, Title III.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to improve Safety\n\nWe have an on-going commitment to ensure the health and safety of  our employees and the surrounding community.  Periodic and recurring evaluation is made of our operating conditions and procedures, to ensure the safety of personnel and the community.  Currently, no additional safety practices or procedures require implementation."
