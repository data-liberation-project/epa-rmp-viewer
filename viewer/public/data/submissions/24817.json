This is on site on a part-time basis depending on the nature of the test program pursued by Fractionation Research, Inc.  The properties of  butane make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle the butane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.   Our emergency response program includes procedures for notification of local city and university emergency response authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors."
