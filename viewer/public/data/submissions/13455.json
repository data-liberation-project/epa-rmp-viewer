      "SummaryText": "1. The owners , management, and employees of Champaign Landmark are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility employees will work with the local fire departments and whatever other agencies that may be involved to minimize the impact to the surrounding environment.\n2. The West LIberty facility is located in the north central part of Champaign county, it is in a very small population area.  The ammonia at this facility is received both by truck and rail, and is used for farm fertilizer.  The facility has two 12,000 gal. tanks that will give you a maximum storage of 20,400 gal and then  the possibility of a rail car holding 150,000pounds .\n3. The worst case scenario would be the total release of the storage tank ( 20,400 GAL. ).  This would reach it endpoint of 200 ppm at 2.10 miles from the tank.  The alternate release would be from a 1.5 inch transfer hose and would be 11,908 lbs. and would reach its endpoint in .68 mi. from the tank in approximately two minutes.\n4. The facility has implemented the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.1 11, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The ODA regulations are also used.\n5. This facility has not had a reportable release in the last five years.\n6. Our Emergency response program is current and has been gone over with all personnel.\n7. Champaign Landmark will remain proactive in the area of accident prevention.  With the ODA and Workers Comp. along with our self audits we feel that the chances of accidental releases are minimal.  We are making no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes at this time."
