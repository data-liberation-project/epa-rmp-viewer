Facility Policy.\n\n     The owner's, management and employees of Trotter Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire dept., the Custer County LEPC, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the enviroment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop porduction. The maximim quantity stored would be 355,000 pounds in storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario:\n\n    a.The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over a 10 minute period. The distance to the endpoint would be 3 miles. The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.\n\n    b.The alternative release scenario: a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/vlaves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .3 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, In,. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administr"

Five-year Accident History.\n\n      There have been no reportable accidental releases of anhydous ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility;nor, to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES  resulting in offf-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, property damage, ore environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program.\n\n      The Facility has:\n      a. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 DFR 1910.38;\n\n      b. Provided state and local authorities with the empergency planning and communtiy right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n      Safety improvements are an on-going process at this facility.Perodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance and safe conditions of our equipment. there are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time.\n\n8.
