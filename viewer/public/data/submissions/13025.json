      "SummaryText": " Executive Summary for the City of Houston East Water Purification Plant Risk Management Plan\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe East Water Purification Plant is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the facility's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the East Water Purification Plant's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur unforeseeably, the East Plant's emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility is also completely coordinated with the City of Houston's Hazardous Materials Response Unit and the City of Galena Park Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe East Water Purification Plant's function is to purify surface water for the purpose of providing drinking water to the surrounding area.  There are two regulated substances present at the facility, chlorine and ammonia.  The regulated substances are both used in the disinfection process.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility is 568,000 pounds, while ammonia is present at the facility in a maximum quantity of 67,600 pounds.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, the East Water Purification Plant has used the tables and equations provided by the EPA in its RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenar"

The scenario involves the release of 180,000 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over a period of 10 minutes from an exposed 90-ton chlorine railcar.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 14.2 miles is obtained, corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nAt least one alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from the ton container storage building on West Street at the south gate.  The scenario involves the release of 800 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over a period of 30 minutes.  No passive mitigation controls are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine is 0.1 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from the ton container storage building on West Street at the south gate.  The scenario involves the release of 600 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over a period of 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a leak from the day storage tank. The scenario involves the release of 6,100 pounds of ammonium hydroxide over a period of 90 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.

The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the East Water Purification Plant's stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe East Water Purification Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with its processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is inspection of the plant to identify deficiencies throughout the system. Work orders are then generated for corrective measures.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations, and are revalidated routinely.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner, with hazard items being deemed high priority and corrected first.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within its covered processes, the East Water Purification Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\nThe East Water Purification Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are responsible for processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe East Water Purification Plant carries out highly doc"
