The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. Equipment associated with this covered process includes up to six (6) 34,000-gallon railcars that are stored on a spur east of the Facility, and the northeast and central rail spurs at the Facility.  Trained Facility personnel conduct inspections of the railcars in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the PSM/RMPr while the railcars are staged on the Facility rail spur.\n\n\n\nAt the northeast rail spur, the Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC) transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the railcar and to its mobile pipe reactor to manufacture ammonium polyphosphate Fertilizer.  The IFRC is responsible for the railcar and transfer of anhydrous ammonia when its equipment is connected to the railcar.  The Facility requires that the IFRC have in place and demonstrates compliance with its OSHA PSM for the mobile pipe reactor operations.\n\n\n\nAt the central rail spur, trained Facility personnel conduct the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the rail car and to the 18,000-gallon stationary storage tanks, or to the aqua ammonia reactor or aqua bubbling process to blend aqua ammonia.  Minidoka is responsible for conducting the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the railcars in accordance with this PSM/RMPr.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Land View, Inc. (LVI) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations in Minidoka, ID.  At this Facility, LVI engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use LVI's products to support agricultural operations (See Section 3.0 of the PSM/RMPr).  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Minidoka Facility located approximately 0.5 miles west-southwest of Minidoka at 925 N. Highway 24, Rupert, ID 83350.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Minidoka Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Minidoka Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nLVI is submitting this as a 5-year update.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Minidoka Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates five covered processes that include (1) Covered Process 1: Railcar Storage; (2) Covered Process 2: APP Blending; (3) Covered Process 3: Storage and Handling and Aqua Blending; and (4) Covered Process 4: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia).  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via 34,000-gallon railcars (Covered Process 1) or a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck.  As related to Covered Process 2, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars and to a mobile pipe reactor to manufacture APP fertilizer"

      "SummaryText": ".  As related to Covered Process 3, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars to two 18,000-gallon stationary storage tanks and from the storage tanks to the stationary aqua ammonia reactor or bubbling process.  As related to Covered Process 4, aqua ammonia is transferred from the stationary aqua ammonia reactor or from commercial tanker trucks into the storage tanks, or from the storage tanks to commercial tanker trucks for transportation and delivery to the client.\n\n\n\nThe Minidoka Facility owns and operates Covered Processes 3 and 4 in accordance with this PSM/RMPr.  As related to Covered Process 1, Minidoka does not own or operate the railcars but does conduct inspections in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Operating Procedures.  As related to Covered Process 2, Minidoka Contracts an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC) to manufacture the APP Fertilizer.  Minidoka requires that the IFRC have in place and operates its mobile pipe reactor equipment in accordance with an OSHA PSM.    \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for the railcar assumes that a vapor valve is not completely closed after a transfer operation and anhydrous vapor is released for a 60 minute period before the valve is closed.  The alternative scenario for processes 2, 3 and 4 assumes a rupture of a transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  \n\n\n\nAll elements of the off-site consequence analysis have been addressed and updated.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT P"
