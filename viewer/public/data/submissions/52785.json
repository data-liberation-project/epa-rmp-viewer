Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed. Given that Cardinal Ethanol, LLC is a new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information prior to start up of the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nCardinal Ethanol, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nCardinal Ethanol, LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nCardinal Ethanol, LLC ethanol plant is located in Union City, Randolph County, Indiana.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn. The regulated substances under the RMP program are anhydrous ammonia and denaturant (natural gasoline).
