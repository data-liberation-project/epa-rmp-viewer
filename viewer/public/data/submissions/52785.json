Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed. Given that Cardinal Ethanol, LLC is a new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information prior to start up of the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nCardinal Ethanol, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nCardinal Ethanol, LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nCardinal Ethanol, LLC ethanol plant is located in Union City, Randolph County, Indiana.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn. The regulated substances under the RMP program are anhydrous ammonia and denaturant (natural gasoline). Cardinal Ethanol, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 5.1 miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be 0.8 miles; due to the amount of each substance stored on site.\n\nOff-site Consequences Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all 78,795 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud. The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site. The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.1 miles from the center of the ammonia tank. Rural residence homes, recreation, major commercial, office and industrial areas are located within this 5.1 mile radius.\n\nThe worst-case release sc"

The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.8 miles from the center of the tank farm. Rural residence homes are located within this 0.8 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Cardinal Ethanol, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has to be completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nCardinal Ethanol, LLC has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances on site.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Cardinal Ethanol, LLC ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan and an SPCC.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities. Cardinal Ethanol, LLCA?s corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\nA safety inspection and a review of the facilityA?s emergency response plan is pending.\n"
