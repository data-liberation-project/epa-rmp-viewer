The emergency response program includes a guide for communication with emergency responders and emergency systems (911) and an emergency response to a chlorine release. As part of this program, all personnel receive annual training on chlorine release management, and an annual drill exercise is conducted. Evacuation exercises are also performed quarterly. On December 1st, 2023, a multi-sectorial drill exercise was conducted where a chlorine release was simulated. All the local emergency responders and industries nearby participated. The communication with the Emergency Systems (911) and local responders, as well as their time of arrival, the facility evacuation, the control of the chlorine release, the management of injured persons, and the decontamination process, were evaluated.\nTool kits to control chlorine release are maintained at the facility. All safety, health, prevention, and emergency information is available to employees. The most important element related to the accident prevention program and the emergency response plan is the employees' knowledge of DOT product-process-equipment (operational & safety) involved in this operation.\n \nV. Planned changes to improve safety:\nLaser Products, Inc. has implemented the following actions to comply with the requirements of the Puerto Rico Department of Health and PSM/RMP regulations:\n-The sodium hypochlorite plant is stopped when visitors are present.\n-HAZWOPER and GMP trainings are offered annually, chlorine gas alarm detectors are visibly and audible located,\n-Part catalog numbers are maintained so that like-for-like replacements can be ordered.

Our prevention program was developed mostly with information gathered from the different Chlorine Institute pamphlets and from our suppliers of Chlorine (Jones Chemical). The most important practices in our accident release prevention program are as follows: the use of containers, hoses, clamps, adapters, valves, pipes, emergency kits, wrenches, SCBA, and other related equipment to handle Chlorine that is approved by the DOT, OSHA, and the Chlorine Institute. Operators are continuously trained in the use of the above equipment. There will always be at least two operators when chlorinating. We perform periodic inspections and corrective actions on our containers, process control devices, and operational and safety equipment. Unauthorized personnel will be restricted to the plant. Hot works are forbidden in the presence of chlorine containers; areas will be cleared of chlorine containers before work. No more than a six-ton container connected at a time. Safety equipment like SCBA, type B suits, and emergency kits are in working condition and available on-site anytime. All works and activities are performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Chlorine Institute. Two chlorine gas alarm detectors are in working condition all the time. The sodium hypochlorite manufacturing plant automatically stops if the alarms detect a chlorine gas release exceeding thresholds (3 ppm). Vessel conditions and hydrostatic compliance are frequently monitored.  \n \nIII. Five-year accidental history:\nNo accidental chlorine release has occurred since Laser Products, Inc. started operating in 1997.\n \nIV. Emergency response program:\nOur emergency response plan includes the participation of the Plant Operators, the Engineer in Charge, and the local emergency responders: the Agency for the Emergency Management and"

      "SummaryText": "I. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility:\n Laser Products, Inc., has been dedicated to manufacturing sodium hypochlorite since July 1997. The plant is located outside (Road # 185), the urban zone of Juncos, PR. The manufacturing process combines tanks, pumps, pipes, valves, heat exchangers, chillers, and process control devices. Raw materials used are Caustic Soda (50% liquid) and Chlorine (liquified gas) in 1-ton containers (2000 lbs). The sodium hypochlorite manufacturing process consumes six tons (2000 lb) containers of chlorine, which are connected simultaneously per batch. In this process, chlorine is injected into diluted caustic soda at the required level. The maximum chlorine inventory on-site is 195,000 lb.\nChlorine, a regulated substance, is a toxic gas that can cause damage to humans, animals, and vegetation. Laser Products understands that the use of chlorine gas in its manufacturing processes represents potential risks to workers and the surrounding communities. Therefore, it is our commitment to ensure a safe working environment by supporting all the activities and proper actions required to comply with the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Local Fire Department. Our products are registered and regulated by the EPA and the Department of Agriculture, as a pesticide. Recently, it was certified by the National Standard Foundation for drinking water disinfection and can also be used for wastewater disinfection.\nAs an overall approach to chemical safety, Laser Products, Inc. has two chlorine sensors with alarms and the proper safety equipment. Plant operators are well-trained in the use of both process and safety equipment.\n \n \nII.
