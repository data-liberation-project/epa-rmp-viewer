(Warren) Council Bluffs facility.\r\n\r\n<> The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are addressed in the Risk Management Program & Process Safety Management Program Manual, which details the RMP program requirements as well as how Warren complies with the applicable requirements.  The Council Bluffs facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.  \r\n\r\n<> The stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\r\nThe Council Bluffs facility is located in Pottawattamie County, Iowa. The Distribution Center stores and ships manufactured packaged automotive aftermarket products and distributed aftermarket products purchased from vendors. From the Distribution Center, Warren distributes over 10,000 types of automobile accessories, fluids, and other car care products.  These products include items such as oils, antifreezes, window washer fluids, gasoline antifreezes, starting fluids, waxes, cleaning products, wiper blades, filters, air fresheners, and many more. Storage of product consists of racking systems and palletized stacking.  This facility has a 7,280 square foot aerosol room in its southeast corner solely for the storage of aerosol products. The aerosol cans may contain the following flammable substances: \r\n\r\n        <> Ethyl ether (60-29-7)\r\n        <> Propane (74-98-6)\r\n        <> Isobutane (75-28-5)\r\n\r\nPredictive filing is selected for these chemicals because the actual inventory of products with these propellants will vary over time, based on finished goods"

The site Offsite Consequence Analysis modeling report contains the actual site values, which demonstrate the site's qualification as a RMP Level 1 facility.\r\n\r\n<> The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\r\nThe Council Bluffs facility is not required to implement the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations because they are eligible for RMP Program Level 1.  However, the Council Bluffs facility is subject to the requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of flammable or explosive chemicals codified under the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119). The required elements of the PSM prevention program are listed below: \r\n \tEmployee Participation\r\n \tProcess Safety Information\r\n \tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n \tOperating Procedures\r\n \tTraining\r\n \tContractors\r\n \tPre-startup Safety Review\r\n \tMechanical Integrity\r\n \tHot Work Permit\r\n \tManagement of Change\r\n \tIncident Investigation\r\n \tEmergency Planning and Response\r\n \tCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThese items, their specific requirements, and how the Council Bluffs facility complies with the requirements are addressed in the Risk Management Program & Process Safety Management Program Manual.\r\n\r\n<> The five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\r\nThe Council Bluffs facility has had no RMP reportable incident in the previous five years. \r\n\r\n<> The emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\r\nIn the event of an emergency, facility employees will notify the local emergency responders identified in the Emergency Action Plan to respond and will evacuate when needed.  Additional details related to emergency procedures can be located in the facility's Emer"

The facility has ensured no ethyl ether is stored on the exterior wall of the aerosol propellants storage room. The facility will also implement a chemical inventory module which will provide notification for chemicals approaching any RMP or PSM threshold quantities to give the facility time to implement proper response actions."
