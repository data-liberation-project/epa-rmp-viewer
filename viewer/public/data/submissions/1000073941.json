If an answering machine picks up the call, the emergency message will be left on the machine.\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending and propane storage systems, including the associated piping, storage vessels and butane/propane rail cars. To date, the facility has not had an accident involving butane or propane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Fire Department and Dane County Emergency Management. \n\nEfforts to improve system safety include implementing a web based notification system (SmartNotice) to enhance internal and external communication in the event of an emergency.  During an emergency, the notification system can be used to communicate critical information including security threats, fires, and chemical releases to local McFarland businesses, the McFarland Fire Department, and Dane County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nThe SmartNotice service will be capable of reaching out to people in minutes.  During an emergency situation, facility trained personnel will be able to send out a notification from the web, app, or call a 24/7 phone number staffed by Emergency Communications Network (ECN), the provider of SmartNotice, who will facilitate sending out the message on U.S. Energy's behalf.  Notifications can be sent via email, text, and/or phone depending on each individual preference."
