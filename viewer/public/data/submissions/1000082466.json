The owners, management, and employees of Agricultural Services, Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information.\n\n\n\nA?    The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nA?    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\nA?    The maximum quantity stored would be 196,000# in two tanks, which are a 30,000, gal. and a 12,000 gal. vessel.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi transport with the capacity of approximately 40,000#.\n\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nA?    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or semi transport) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 196,000 pounds, which represents the volume the 42,000 gal. storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.82 miles.\n\nA?    The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\n\n\n4.    The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nA?    The facility has implemented the provisions of A?Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1A?, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, A?Storage and handling of anhydrous a"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n-    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n\n\n-    to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.    The emergency response program.\n\n\n\nA?    The facility has:\n\n\n\na.    A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 DFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc.    A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 DFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nA?    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information, contact: Gary Ostermeier, Plant Manager"
