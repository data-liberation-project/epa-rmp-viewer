This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass REPACKAGE INDUSTRIAL AND MEDICAL GASES AND MANUFACUTURE ACETYLENE.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Acetylene  [Ethyne], Chlorine, Propane and Propylene  [1-Propene].  All used for fuel gases.  \n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from STORAGE OF CHLORINE.  In this scenario 150 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 15 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 3.125% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scen"

Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.08 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from MANUFACTURE OF ACETYLENE.  In this scenario 163260 lb. of Acetylene  [Ethyne] is released.  The release quantity has been limited to 25% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.45 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1-psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from MANUFACTURE OF ACETYLENE.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire.  The scenario involves the release of 15 lb. of Acetylene  [Ethyne] in  60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as deluge system(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include deluge system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability limit is 0.06 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHOLOX LTD. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined) and/or HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every two years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 08/15/2003.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, HOLOX LTD. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHOLOX LTD. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHOLOX LTD. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
