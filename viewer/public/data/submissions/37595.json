The facility also has implemented a maintenance program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous material, the facility has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire from the facility. In the event of a release, the facility will call the Bedford Park Fire Department located at the facility boundary for assistance as appropriate.\n\nHazard Evaluation\nUnder the EPA regulations, the facility is required to evaluate the potential consequences of a worst case release and various alternate release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide a description of the worst case and alternate scenarios for the base. \n\nThe RMP regulations define a worst-case release as \u00bfthe release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in Sections 68.22 (a) (40 CFR 68.3). The worst-case release scenario for toxic liquids assumes that the total quantity in a vessel is spilled instantaneously onto a flat non-absorbing surface to form a pool.  Passive mitigation systems, such as dikes, are taken into account in the consequence analysis.  The release rate to air is estimated as the rate of evaporation from the pool of spilled toxic liquid.  Each tank at the Argo Terminal is located within a diked area \n\nFor Tanks 5-15 and C-11, it was assumed that the contents of the tank empty instantaneously to a diked area.  The diked area is capable of holding the capacity of the largest tank, plus sufficient free board to allow for precipitation.  The evaporation rate was then determined using CHARM which was then used to determine"

      "SummaryText": "the distance to endpoint.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOn September 29, 1996 the Argo Terminal experienced a release of vinyl acetate, a listed RMP chemical.  During a severe thunderstorm, heavy winds knocked a piece of equipment from the roof of a nearby tank, resulting in a ruptured pipe on Tank 5-16 which at the time was used to store vinyl acetate.  An estimated 9,000 gallons of vinyl acetate was released to the diked area.  Because of the severe weather, the dike drains had been left open to prevent flooding of the diked area.  As a result, the material was discharged to the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District sanitary sewer system. No material was discharged to a waterway or over land. The discharge did not result in any on site or offsite deaths or injuries, evacuations, or sheltering in place. It is unknown if the MWRD was able to treat the release or if it passed through the treatment system and was discharged to waterways, therefore the environmental impacts of this release are undetermined.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThe RMP regulations require that response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at  the Argo Terminal are coordinated with the Cook County Central LEPC and Bedford Park Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of the facility\u00bfs activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections, maintenance, and capital improvements.  Further improvements will continue to be implemented as appropriate."

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nFacilities that use or store more than 15,000 lbs. of vinyl acetate or cyclohexylamine are required to prepare and submit to U.S. EPA a Risk Management Program (RMP).  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The RMP includes the following information:\n\n\u00bf\tIntroduction;\n\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00bf\tPolicies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; and\n\u00bf\tPlanned Changes to improve safety\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\nThe Kinder Morgan Argo Terminal is a Public \u00bfFor-hire\u00bf Bulk Liquid Storage Terminal, approximately 145 acres in area located approximately 15 miles Southwest of the City of Chicago.  GATX Terminals Corporation owned and operated the Argo Terminal since its inception in 1951 till it was bought out by Kinder Morgan Liquid Terminals,  LLC in March 2001.  The Terminal is bounded by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to the West, Corn Products Corporation to the north, Archer Avenue to the East, and the Shell Oil Terminal and the Univar Distribution Facility to the South. Bedford Park Fire Station Number 1 has been constructed at the entrance to the Argo Terminal.  The Terminal provides tank storage for liquid chemicals, petroleum and food grade products and raw materials owned by others on a \u00bfcontract\u00bf basis.  Presently 217 permitted aboveground storage tanks are available (approximately 100,000,000 gallon capacity) for storage and distribution of customer products, or for support activities.  Materials are received at the Terminal by tank trucks, rail cars, barge, and p"

      "SummaryText": "ipeline.  \n\nOf the 217 permitted aboveground storage tanks, two tanks are covered by the RMP regulation.  These tanks are Tank 5-15 (storage of vinyl acetate) and Tank C-11 (storage of cyclohexylamine).  Tank UC-24 (storage of vinyl acetate) was previously part of the RMP, however, this tank has since been removed from service and this RMP is an update to reflect current operations.\n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at the Argo Terminal.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  The facility is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment.\n\nPrevention Program \nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program requirements (40 CFR 68). This prevention program covers those processes that handle regulated substances above the threshold amount.  The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\u00bf\tProcess safety information is accessible at all times.\n\u00bf\tA hazard review was conducted as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.\n\u00bf\tWritten operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n\u00bf\tTraining is provided to all employees that operate the system.\n\u00bf\tA program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment.\n\u00bf\tIncidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n\u00bf\tRoutine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\nThe processes at the facility subject to the Risk Management Program are designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of a hazardous material. Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems.  \n\nIn add"
