This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is DEQP's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, operations personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release, as applicable within their level of training and ability; however, the facility is classified as non-responding.  DEQP has contracted Clean Harbors as an Oil/Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise as needed.  Also, as a non-responding facility, DEQP will contact the Uintah County Dispatch (covers Daggett County) to obtain additional resources from Uintah and Daggett Counties including local volunteer fire departments, law enforcement, and emergency medical services depending on the seriousness of an incident.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\n\n\nStationary Source, Regulated Substances Handled, and Covered Process:\n\n\n\nKastler DPP is a natural gas extraction plant that receives natural gas and processes it to remove heavier hydrocarbons from the gas. The inlet gas is chilled in a refrigeration process train to lower the cricondentherm dew point. The chiller system uses propane as a refrigerant in a "

The residue gas (primarily methane) is compressed and sent back to DEQP's transmission pipeline system for delivery to downstream customers.  The mixed natural gas liquid (NGL) product containing pentane, isopentane [butane, 2-methyl], butane, isobutane [propane, 2-methyl], propane, and ethane is sent to one of the two 45,000-gallon product storage tanks.  The tanks are administratively controlled to 80% of capacity or a maximum of 36,000-gallons each (72,000 gallons in total).  The NGL product is a flammable mixture that meets the NFPA-4 criteria and is present onsite in a process, in an amount, that exceeds the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) for applicability under the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements.  Also, the propane refrigerant is stored in four 1000-gallon pressurized tanks that collectively exceed the 10,000-pound threshold quantity for a flammable substance, and therefore, are subject to RMP.  No regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity are present at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\n\n\nDEQP has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  Kastler DPP is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is classified as a Program 3 process under USEPA's RMP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the facility.  These elements of the RMP program are documented in DEQP Standard Practice 4-00-02 (General PSM-RMP procedures) and Standard Practice 4-34-05a (Kastler specific RMP).\n\n\n\nProcess Safety In"

Much of this information was compiled during preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).  The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers, distributors, or importers to provide SDSs to communicate the hazards of hazardous chemical products.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - DEQP personnel conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the regulated process are identified and controlled efficiently.  DEQP primarily uses the HAZOP method analysis, supplemented by Checklist techniques, to perform these hazard evaluations.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n \n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, DEQP maintains written operating procedures in Standard Practice 4-34-05 that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or pipi"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out and before any contractors perform work at Kastler DPP, they undergo an orientation.  During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related to the work, the hazards of regulated substances, and the safe work procedures insisted on by DEQP.  In addition, they are familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out Procedures.  Contractors are further informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Emergency response information includes evacuation routes and personnel assembly points.  DEQP documents that all contract personnel have received the training and understand its importance and purpose.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps - The covered processes at Kastler DPP present hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  Collectively, the prevention program activities described above help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  In addition, Kastler DPP incorporates safety features on its equipment to help (a) quickly detect a release (e.g., hydrocarbon detectors with alarms; (b) contain/control a release ("

This website is readily available for use on employee computer terminals and the emergency response plan is also kept onsite for immediate access should an emergency response be required.  The Kastler DPP Operations & Maintenance Standard Practice 4-34-05 contains an emergency response plan that addresses accidental releases of regulated substances and is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.\n\n\n\nThe plan includes actions to be taken including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notifications to local emergency response agencies and the public.  To ensure proper function, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the processes that would require a modified emergency response.  In the event of an emergency, DEQP will immediately notify 911 (Uintah County Dispatch).  The professional and volunteer emergency responders will coordinate emergency response activities.\n\n\n\nThe emergency plan has been coordinated with the Daggett County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\n\n\nDEQP is committed to continuous improvement and looks for opportunities to improve safety systems and programs at the facility by reinforcing the importance of safety on a daily basis, encouraging employee participation, giving all employees and contractors stop work authority, and implementi"
