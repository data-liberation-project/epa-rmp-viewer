      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nPrairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC\n\nPrairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC is a newly constructed facility.  Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed.  Given that Prairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC is a new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information prior to the start up of the facility.  On the same note, there has never been a change in management.  The management is \"new\" and therefore, the \"new\" management was implemented with the construction of the facility. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nPrairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nPrairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nPrairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC ethanol plant is located in Phillipsburg, Phillips County, Kansas.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  Prairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 5.6  miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.5 miles; due to the amount of ammonia and denaturant stored on site.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 97,200 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud o"

      "SummaryText": "r release 190,400 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nFor ammonia, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, schools and other public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.\n\nFor denaturant, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes and other public receptors are located within this 0.5 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Prairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nPrairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite.  There have been no accidents since the establishment of Prairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nPrairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Prairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC 's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
