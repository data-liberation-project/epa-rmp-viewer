The Johnstown WWTP is subject to the requirements of Subpart C of 40 C.F.R Part 68, relating to Program 2 facilities.  The Plant's Risk Management Plan (RMP) involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to.  Mr. Jeffrey Mulligan, is the Project Manager and is the Plant's RMP Emergency Contact and the person who has the overall responsibility for implementing the RMP for the Johnstown Waste Water Treatment Plant.  The Plant's Risk Management Plan is based upon the following elements:\r\n\r\n1. Operator/Employee training\r\n2. Preventive maintenance program\r\n3. Safety equipment usage\r\n4. Use of accurate and effective operating procedures\r\n5. Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\r\n6. Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\r\n\r\nA. The Johnstown WWTP is a pure oxygen activated sludge sewage treatment plant that serves the city and all or part of seventeen surrounding municipalities. The type of waste treated is primarily domestic with a limited number of light industrial contributors. The final step of secondary treatment at the plant before it is discharged into the Conemaugh River is disinfection of the final effluent by chlorine gas.  The plant utilizes ton containers of chlorine gas for this purpose.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored at the plant at any given time is Fourteen (14) one-ton cylinders.  These cylinders are housed in the Chlorine Storage Room which has the Chlorine Regulator Room adjacent to it.  Both of these rooms have a chlorine gas detection device that sounds audio alarms as well as a visual alarm in the event of a leak.  The visual alarms are located above the doors to the chlorine storage and regulator rooms and the audio alarms are located ar"

Chlorine is the only chemical onsite that requires reporting under SARA Title III.  The use and storage of Chlorine at the Plant is regulated by the EPA through a Risk Management Plan.  The plant operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. A shift operator is on duty on each shift and he has, as part of his duties, responsibility to monitor all of the chlorine and its related equipment.\r\n\r\nB. Mr. Jeffrey Mulligan, the Project Manager and the Plant's Emergency Coordinator, Mr. Mike Sabo, the Plant's Lead Maintenance Tech and Mr. Mark W. Lazzari, AICP of the EADS Group, successfully completed a Process Hazard Review of the Plant including completion of Hazard Review Checklists on June 21, 2012.  No significant problems were identified in the Process Hazard Review.  Documentation of the Process Hazard Review is maintained at the Plant.  Copies of the Hazard Review Checklists were submitted to the EPA on June 22, 2012.\r\n\r\nC.  After completion of the Process Hazard Review, Mr. Jeffrey Mulligan, the Project Manager and the Plant's Emergency Coordinator, completed a Compliance Audit for the Plant.  The Audit was completed on or around June 21, 2012. No significant items needing resolution were identified in the Audit.  Documentation of the Compliance Audit is maintained at the Plant.  The Compliance Audit was submitted to the EPA on June 22, 2012.\r\n\r\nD. An extensive Safety Training Program at the Plant was completed in January 2012.  All Plant employees including Mr. Mulligan completed the Safety Training.  The Safety Training Program was prepared and conducted primarily by Mr. Tom Patterson, CSP, of Professional Safety and Health, Inc.  The Safety Training consisted of Hazard Communication Training (2-Hour OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200), Confined Space Entry Training (4-hour OSHA 29 CFR 1910.146), Self Contained Breathing Apparatus"

Mr. Mulligan provided Chlorine Process Safety Training and review/training of the Plant's Hazardous Materials Response Plan.  A Hazardous Communication (MSDS) Program was also prepared as part of this Safety Training Program. The purpose of this Communication Program is to provide a method for employees to learn about chemicals in their workplace and how to work safely with those materials.  Certificates of Training are maintained at the Plant.  In addition to the Safety Training Program, Mr. Mulligan provides tours of the Plant to the Johnstown Fire Department and the Cambria County Sharp HAZMAT Team.  The purpose of these tours is to familiarize Emergency Responders with the Plant's employees and general layout and its operations and to familiarize them with the Plant's Chlorine related processes and hazards.   \r\n\r\nE. An offsite consequence analysis was completed using RMP*Comp on Jan 24, 2014 and included consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario.\" The \"worst case release\" scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\"  The following summarizes the results of the analysis:\r\nThe worst case release scenario at the Johnstown WWTP involves a failure of a one ton container connected to the manifold that feeds the chlorine regulator. The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for the following conditions: the release of the entire amount (2,000 pounds) as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full"

EPA mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 3.4 mph, standard daily maximum temperature (77 degrees F) were used for the analysis. When atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 3,500 was obtained. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of a flexible connection to a one ton container, possibly due to physical contact by an employee. The release is estimated to be 285 pounds over one half-hour at an average rate of 9.5 pounds per minute. Toxic endpoint distances to the ERPG-2 level was obtained. The typical meteorological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed 6.7 mph and 77degrees F.  The estimated distance traveled to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles. Actuation of the chlorine alarm is an active mitigation measure considered. An additional mitigation system is the use of vacuum withdrawal from the ton containers. This will reduce significantly the amount of chlorine released in a pigtail rupture. \r\n\r\nF. Chemical process related safety equipment maintained at the Plant includes four (4) self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), two (2) encapsulated entry suits, chlorine gas detection equipment, a Chlorine \"B\" leak kit and the One Ton Chlorine Container Containment and Repair Kit.  A \"B\" Kit Training Device is also provided at the Plant for regular employee training. Further, each Monday each shift has a safety meeting to discuss the possible hazards in the workplace. The result of these meetings is a report that is forwarded to the chief operator that outlines any safety concerns of the employees. This report can contain information specific to any deficiencies in the chlorination supply and equipment as well as other areas of the plant.\r\n\r\nG. A number of Chlorine related Standar"

The Plan describes emergency response actions to be taken on-site by Plant personnel in the evident of a Chlorine release as well as by County, local and other emergency management personnel responding to a hazard emergency at the Plant. This Plan was originally prepared for the Plant in 1989 by the Cambria County Emergency Management Agency in accordance with the requirements under Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the Hazardous Materials Emergency Planning and Response Act (Act 165), as amended, of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The chemical of concern is Chlorine.  The Plan identifies responsibilities and procedures for community preparedness and response to a hazardous material (hazmat) incident at the Plant.
