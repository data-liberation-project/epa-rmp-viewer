The Safety Coordinator administers the facility's safety and environmental policies.  The Safety Coordinator periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.  In addition, Alta Dena Dairy has established a `PSM Committee\u00bf, which periodically convenes to assess the effective implementation of the facility\u00bfs Risk Management Program and to assign responsibility for the enhancement of any items found to be unsatisfactory.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAlta Dena Dairy is located at 17637 East Valley Boulevard in the City of Industry, California, which is approximately 1 mile north of the CA-60 Freeway and 1.5 miles south of the CA-39 Freeway.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The facility and the refrigeration system began operation in the 1960s.\n\nNOTE:  CURRENT ALTA DENA DAIRY MANAGEMENT ASSUMED CONTROL OF FACILITY OPERATIONS POST JUNE 1999.  THROUGH THE COURSE OF RESUBMITING THE FACILITY'S RMP, MANAGEMENT DISCOVERED THAT THE RMP SUBMIT ON FILE AT THE FACILITY WAS NOT FOR ALTA DENA DAIRY.  MOREOVER, THE FACILITY HAS BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE AN INITIAL RMP SUBMISSION BY THE PREVIOUS MANAGEMENT TO EPA.  AS A RESULT, ALTA DENA DAIRY IS SUBMITTING THIS RMP AS THE FACILITY'S INITIAL SUBMISSION.\n\nThe primary business of Alta Dena Dairy is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for the production"

In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 50,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for glycol chilling, cold/freezer storage, ice-making, and ice-cream-making.  Typical operating conditions range from 22\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 150 psig on the high side of the system.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM),\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n3) OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Alta Dena Dairy to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program"

      "SummaryText": "ensures that Alta Dena Dairy's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility intends to install ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alarm and cease operation of the refrigeration system at a predetermined setpoint.  The ammonia sensors are due to be installed by May 2005.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Alta Dena Dairy Hazard Assessment Update Report (05/04/2004), there have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (May 1999 - May 2004.)\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\u00bf save lives;\n\u00bf minimize and avoid injuries;\n\u00bf protect the environment; and\n\u00bf minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility as well as detailing the training, procedures, and members of the Emergency Response Team.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn May 1999, the refrigeration system was"
