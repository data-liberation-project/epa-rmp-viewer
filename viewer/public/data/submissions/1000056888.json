Furthermore, is it committed to conducting business in a manner that is comparable with the balanced environmental needs of the community in which it operates. This commitment requires compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, facilities which are designed and operated to high standards, and systematic identification and management of safety, health, and environmental risks. In keeping with this commitment, PeroxyChem's Tonawanda Plant has established a comprehensive Safety Management System that strives to identify and eliminate all potential exposures that include, but are not limited to, personal injury/illness, property damage, fires, process incidents, and breaches of security. The Safety Management System embodies and employs the spirit and intent of the concepts found in the ACC Responsible Care Initiative, the OSHA PSM Standard, all other applicable regulatory standards, and PeroxyChem's Corporate Safety and Industrial Hygiene Policies and strategies.\n\n\n\nThe Plant's Safety Policy:\n\n\n\nPeroxyChem is committed to operating a safe facility. All employees are responsible for creating a safe and healthy workplace for themselves, their fellow employees, visitors, the community, and our customers.

The covered process is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia (CAS 07664-41-7).

Public impact includes, schools, residences, hospitals, recreation areas, and major commercial offices or industrial areas. Environmental impacts include state parks and wildlife sanctuaries, preserves or refuges.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios - RMP regulations require that at least one alternate release scenario be identified and analyzed for each regulated toxic chemical present. A scenario that is more realistic than the worst case scenario was selected as the alternate release case.\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario simulates an ammonia railcar transfer line rupture. The event is assumed to release 6,840 pounds of ammonia during a twenty (20) minute period at a rate of 342 pounds per minute. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/l) is 0.3 miles. This scenario was modeled using the RMP*Comp and assumed a complete rupture of the liquid transfer hose during railcar unloading. The loss was assumed to be for a twenty (20) minutes duration with a manual response to close the railcar unloading valve and did not account for the excess flow valve in place on the railcar in order to keep the model conservative. The estimated residential population within the area is ~4500. Public impact includes parks and recreational areas, and major commercial offices and industrial buildings. The institutions, parks, and recreational areas within the 0.3 mile radius from the release source were located using WNY street maps from Map Works, Inc. No environmental contacts were impacted. This scenario did not take into account any of the automatic devices installed in the unloading system, and is therefore considered conservative. The actual response time should be l"

On August 14, 2013, a reportable quantity of ammonia was released and reported to the proper agencies. The primary cause was a valving error which allowed steam to increase the pressure in the storage tank. The pressure relief valve lifted releasing the ammonia. The site initiated emergency response procedures and identified the cause. Proper actions were taken to mitigate the release. An investigation was completed which identified preventive actions, and these are compete.\n\n\n\nPrevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances at the Tonawanda Plant involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. These prevention programs comply with all applicable requirements of OSHA's PSM regulations, as stipulated in 26 CFR 1910.119, and all applicable EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements, as stipulated by 40 CFR Part 68.
