Worst case meteorological conditions are assumed and RMP*Comp was used to calculate the endpoint distance for overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (PSI) for a flammable mixture vapor cloud explosion.   A distance of 0.6 miles to the overpressure endpoint of 1 PSIG was determined for a release of 404,238 pounds in ten minutes for the entire NGL process.  There is one potential public receptor within this radial distance about 0.6 miles to the southeast of the facility. There is a house along HWY 85 that could potential house a few residents.  There are no other environmental receptors within this distance.\r\n\r\nAlternate-Case Release Scenario:\r\nThe alternative release scenario is that one of the 90,000 gallon Y-grade tanks and associated piping is compromised and released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  It is assumed that the tank is only 50% full, thus, it is limited to 45,000 gallons of Y-grade product that could potentially be involved in the vapor cloud explosion, in addition to any associated piping liquids.  The active mitigation considered is that the plant operator will ESD the plant and thereby shutdown the control valve to the NGL tanks which would isolate the tank away from the rest of the process and limit the product available for combustion. The default meteorological conditions associated with the ACRS was assumed and RMP*Comp was used to calculate the endpoint distance for overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (PSI) for a butane vapor cloud explosion.  A distance of 0.2 miles to the overpressure endpoint of 1 PSIG was determined for a release of 204,888 pounds in ten minutes for the potential explosion associated with one of the Y-grade tanks.\r\n\r\nAccident History:\r\nThis is a brand new facility and, therefore, has not experienced an incident that resulted in injuries or environmental damag"

The facility operates at the intersection of 131st St. SW and 38th St. SW and has a legal location indicated as the NW1/4 NW1/4 Section 17, Township 139N, Range 99W.\r\n\r\nProcess Description:\r\nThe plant processes natural gas delivered from production wells.  The inlet compressors gather the inlet field gas coming into the plant at between 10-50 psig and compress it to the inlet of the NGL plant of approximately 500 psig.  The compressed gas is then routed through an NGL skid with ethylene glycol injection which removes water and NGL from the stream.  The rich EG is routed to the dehydration still column, which is fired with heat from the facility hot oil heater, to assist in driving off the water and regenerating the lean EG.  The gas stream from the still column consists primarily of water vapor and CO2, which is vented to atmosphere.  All flash vapors off of the EG flash tank are captured by process and routed back to the facility inlet slug catcher.  At the NGL plant outlet, the gas is compressed to approximately 1400 psig and sold to WBI Pipeline Company.  Extensive natural gas liquids (NGL) are produced from the NGL plant and are routed to four (4) pressurized NGL storage tanks.  The NGL is removed as needed from the tanks by pressurized truck loadout.  Whiting anticipates the potential for up to 240,000 gal/day of NGLs from the plant. \r\n\r\nProgram Level:\r\nIt has been determined that this is a Program 3 facility.

This facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \r\n\r\nPrevention and Response Policies:\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are provided in the facility's Process Safety Management Guidelines manual.  The plant's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Stark County Local Emergency Planning Committee(LEPC) and agency personnel will have a chance to tour the facility.  Whiting Oil and Gas Corpation takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facility by ensuring that employees are trained in the safe operation of the plant and evacuation procedures.  \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances: \r\nThe facility contains a simple NGL product storage and shipping process.  Butane, propane and pentane are the primary components of the NGL inventory listed in the RMP rule.  As there is no specific chemical classification for hexanes+, all of the potential hexanes have been grouped in with the pentanes for the purpose of this analysis. The tanks will all store Y-grade with no additional fractionation into more refined NGLs.  Propane is also used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration process at the plant. All of the chemicals above the RMP threshold are classified as flammable and not toxic. As such, only a flammable release scenario has been analyzed for the Belfield Gas Plant.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\r\nThe worst case release scenario is that one of the four 90,000 gallon NGL tanks and associated piping is ruptured and released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  In the event of a catastrophic release and subsequent explosion, all of the tanks could be compromised given there close proximity and linked piping components.
