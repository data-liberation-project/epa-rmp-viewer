Monarch Nut Company has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\n\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  Monarch Nut Company interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\n\nSmall releases which do not pose a threat will be considered incidental and do not require an emergency response such as a packing leak.

Responders will investigate the release and report to General, Safety and Maintenance Management the location, extent of possible impact, level of risk and recommended actions.\n\nReleases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the General Manager, Safety Manager and the Maintenance Manager, if not on site, for instructions. Responders will investigate the release and report to General, Safety and Maintenance Management the location, extent of possible impact, level of risk and recommended actions.\n\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment on an ongoing basis and prior to seasonal startup. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel, registered engineers, refrigeration experts, and certified refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment.\n\nThere are full time Managers and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance Department that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.  An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. \n\nThis team activity is the core of Monarch Nut Company's prevention program.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Monarch Nut Company facility provides product processing, packaging, cooling, and short-term storage for nuts and fruit.

The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition the Main Plant Systems are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nMonarch Nut Company's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHAA?s Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Monarch Nut Company is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\nKey objectives of Monarch Nut Company's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team"

Monarch Nut Company certifies operators following completion of operator training and Monarch Nut Company's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \n\nSecond, all Monarch Nut Company employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Monarch Nut Company's Management of Change Procedure. \n \nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Monarch Nut Company has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history.

As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\n\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and CUPA.\n\nSee the Prevention Program Element 10 for the complete guidelines. The supporting and completed documents are filed and maintained in the Refrigeration Office.\n\nHot Work and Safe Work Practices\nThis permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Manager reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\nSee the Prevention Program Element 11 for the complete guidelines.

The facilities emergency response plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies. \n\nThe facility has coordinated with outside parties through drills, communication and attendance at Ammonia and Chemical Safety Days. Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency. In addition Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release.\n\nDetailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel.  All areas (zones) inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \n\nThe emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and switches for the system with the release.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The"
