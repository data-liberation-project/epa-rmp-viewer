      "SummaryText": "The John M Asplund WWTF is subject to the RMP since it stores gaseous chlorine in quantities greater than the 2,500 pound threshold for the program. The facility treats municipal wastewater. The chlorine is injected into the wastewater for disinfection prior to release of the treated wastewater to an ocean outfall in Cook Inlet. Eight to thirty four 1-ton containers of chlorine are stored at the facility at any given time.\n\nThe facility is also in compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) program and the SARA Title III program. Several ongoing steps are taken to prevent accidental releases. They include continuous evaluation and updating of the system such as installing additional shut-off valves, making maintenance procedural improvements as they are recognized, and implementing on-site training on a regular basis.\n\nUtility and facility management have a strong commitment to safety at all of the Anchorage Water and Wastewater (AWWU) facilities. Specifically at the John M. Asplund Wastewater Treatment Facility, monthly safety meetings are held to discuss predetermined issues such as ladder safety, forklift safety, and chlorine safety. In addition, weekly operations meetings are held and safety issues are discussed as they come up. New personnel are trained prior to staring work at the facility. Dangerous or hazardous equipment and/or chemicals are well labeled, MSDS sheets on all compounds used at the facility are readily available, and new personnel are always accompanied by experienced personnel when handling compounds such as chlorine.\n\nThe facility has not had a reportable incident in the last five years. \n\nThe Emergency response program for the facility primarily involves response by the Anchorage Fire Department (AFD). The AFD has well trained and equipped HAZMAT teams who will respond in the event of an uncontrolled leak. The AFD and AWWU personnel have participated together in emergency response drills. As part of the comprehensive Emergency Manage"

      "SummaryText": "ment Plan for the Municipality of Anchorage, the facility is one of the listed dispatch centers which are in contact with the Emergency Operations Center during an emergency.\n\nModeling of worst case scenario leaks found a 1.3 mile radius of influence for the chlorine chemical. This radius of influence includes five small commercial buildings associated with the operation of the airport, a recreational area used by bikers and runners, portions of a wildlife refuge, and some undeveloped parkland as public receptors. The alternative release modeling estimates a radius of influence of 0.1 miles and is encompasses portions of the wildlife refuge and a small portion of recreational trails used by the public. Residential units, schools, hospitals or the airport terminal are not located within either radius of influence for these release scenarios."
