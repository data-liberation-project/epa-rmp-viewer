      "SummaryText": "Vandenberg Space Force Base (SFB) encompasses over 99,579 acres in Santa Barbara County,\nCalifornia. Because of its geography, this installation provides America with a unique location from which it can place satellites into polar orbit without overflying populated areas during the launch phase. This mission--which is crucial to national security as well as the burgeoning interest in communications, land resources surveillance, and space research--is dependent on the continued launching of an array of space boosters. In addition, Vandenberg SFB conducts test launches involving Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and also manages the Western Range--a vast network of radar, telemetry, and optical sensors stretching across the Pacific Ocean--in which all three services conduct a variety of aeronautical and missile flight activities. The host unit on Vandenberg SFB is Space Launch Delta 30. While Vandenberg SFB comprises 620 maintained buildings and structures plus 999 family residences for military personnel, only 15 percent of its total area is developed. The remainder provides the buffer needed to preclude encroachment by local development and to protect outlying communities from launch anomalies and associated operational hazards. Restrictive easements limiting development on adjacent private land further reduces any potential risk to the public. Approximately 2,000 launches of space boosters and ICBMs have been conducted at Vandenberg\nSFB, and there is no known instance of serious injury or death to anyone in the surrounding\ncommunities due to the launches themselves or to supporting operations. With this submittal, Vandenberg SFB is making a conscientious effort to fully comply with Section 112r of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 as implemented by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (40 CFR 68), as well as with the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention"

Vertical pipe runs along the west wall of the oxidizer tanks are typically restrained with a pipe support anchored to the concrete wall. However, the northern-most pipes lack this restraint and the unrestrained length of the pipe appears excessive.\nRecommendation: A pipe support to restrain these pipes to the concrete wall is recommended.\nCorrective Action: Completed 5 June 2019\nFinding: Deluge water outlet pipe supports. Steel pipe supports are installed at various locations\nunder the deluge water inlet pipes. The pipe supports appear to be tack welded to the pipes and the welds appear to be corroding.\nRecommendation: Replacing the tack welds with 1-inch fillet welds is recommended; this is the\nminimum weld length required by the American Welding Society. After welding, all welds and\nexposed steel should be recoated.\nCorrective Action Plan: Deluge system is currently in a redesign phase by KAL Architects &\nJensen Hughes Design.\nRecommendations for Further Study\nFinding: PEMB deformation relative to deluge piping. Pre-engineered metal buildings (PEMB)\ngenerally perform well in earthquakes due to the relatively small mass and inherent ductility of steel frames and metal paneling. However, ductility is accompanied by larger building drift which can be incompatible with more rigid systems connected to the building. The deluge water piping is connected by the east wall of the fuel storage building.\nRecommendation: Further evaluation of the deformation compatibility between the building and deluge piping is recommended to ensure that building drift in an earthquake will not inadvertently overstress the piping.\nCorrective Action Plan: Deluge system is currently in a redesign phase by KAL Architects &\nJensen Hughes Design.\nFinding: Pipe Support Spacing.

The format developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for this submittal is generally oriented towards stationary sources that differ significantly from Vandenberg SFB in terms of physical complexity, emergency response capability, and organizational make-up. Accordingly, additional detail and clarification are incorporated in this Executive Summary to provide the public a clearer, more complete insight into the scope and effectiveness of Vandenberg SFB's accidental release\nprevention and emergency response programs.\nScope of the Vandenberg SFB Risk Management Plan\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) includes all covered processes within the borders of Vandenberg SFB that are subject to United States Space Force oversight and control. Under the\nCommercial Space Act, excess facilities on the base may be leased by private entities to conduct\ncommercial activities that are not under the purview of the United States Space Force. Compliance with EPA RMP and CalARP requirements for covered processes that solely support such commercial activities is the responsibility of the respective commercial owner and operator; therefore, any such covered processes are not encompassed by this RMP.\nThis RMP includes one process in which the EPA threshold of a regulated toxic or flammable\nsubstance is exceeded--the Hypergolic Storage Facility. This facility stores and handles the\nregulated toxics 1,1 dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), hydrazine, and methyl hydrazine. The largest\nquantities of UDMH and hydrazine occur in an approximately one-to-one mixture of the two typically referred to as Aerozine 50. In addition, the Hypergolic Storage Facility is used to store significant quantities of the nitrogen tetroxide, which is included in this Risk Management Plan in accordance with the General Duty Clause: Section 112(r)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) is based on National Incident Mana"

The implementation of the AFIMS on Vandenberg SFB is detailed in the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP 10-2). Vandenberg SFB possesses significant emergency response capabilities including its own Fire Department, Disaster Response Force, and Security Police Force, in addition to contracted support for handling accidental releases of regulated hypergolic propellants and other hazardous substances. The Vandenberg SFB Fire Department, 30 CES/CEF, is the \"local agency\" that responds as First Responder at the Technician Level to an accidental release of hazardous materials on the base. This Fire Department comprises some 100 firefighters who staff five fire stations strategically positioned across the base. One fire station is located within a three-minute response time of the Hypergolic Storage Facility. This Fire Department includes a 5-person \"Hot Shot\" crew that is specially trained to respond to wildland fires. The Vandenberg SFB Fire Department is fully compliant with National Fire Protection Agency standards and has mutual aid agreements with Santa Barbara County, the City of Lompoc, the City of Santa Maria, the California Forestry Department, and the Los Padres National Forest. The base Fire Department maintains a regular schedule of onsite facility inspections to identify potentially hazardous conditions to include conditions which could lead to an accidental release of a hazardous material. It should be noted that the Vandenberg SFB Fire Department is advised of all operations involving the transfer of hypergolic propellants which comprise the regulated substances at the Hypergolic Storage Facility.

Building\ncodes require at least two layers of reinforcing in the top 5 inches of column supporting pedestals.\nThis reinforcing provides concrete confinement which helps hold anchors in place when they're\nsubjected to high shear or pullout forces.\nRecommendation: Crack injection repairs are recommended to correct this. Rebar scanning in the top 5 inches of the foundations is recommended to confirm if hoop reinforcing is present.\nCorrective Action: Completed 6 August 2019.\nFinding: Support at disconnected lines. Fuel pipe that is discontinuous because of prior alterations, requires restraint at the top and bottom of the pipe discontinuity. Support is provided to the lower segment of pipe as it intersections with horizontal piping. However, the upper portion of pipe is left unrestrained. Recommendation: A pipe support close to the discontinuity, and anchored to the concrete wall, is recommended. Corrective Action: Completed 5 June 2019.\nFinding: Anchorage repair at fuel stand. The steel flange at the bottom of the fuel pipe stand is\ncorroding, and the concrete where the stand is anchored is spalling.\nRecommendation: Removal and repair of loose"

In addition,\ncorrosion should be removed from the flange and the flange should be recoated to avoid future\ndegradation of the adjacent concrete.\nCorrective Action: Completed 3 October 2018\nFinding: Fuel container restraint. Some fuel containers at the fuel storage facility are unrestrained.\nThe containers include secondary containment which provides for spill protection.\nRecommendation: To reduce the risk of injury to personnel, we recommend the containers be\nrestrained by strapping them with a durable material to the building structure, or a structural bollard anchored to the floor slab.\nCorrective Action: Completed 3 October 2018. PHA 135 and Project Note UPC19-192.\nFinding: Vehicle storage building. Column bases and anchors are significantly corroded at the\nstorage building. Steel clips have been added to some of the columns to provide support where\ncorrosion has eliminated contact between the column base and foundation. Due to the severity of corrosion, the column bases and anchors are no longer able to resist shear forces at the base of the building which may result in separation from the foundation and unpredictable behavior of the facility in an earthquake.\nRecommendation: Due to the severity of corrosion in the facility, a full corrosion survey is\nrecommended to determine if repair or replacement would be more cost effective. At a minimum, retrofit of the column bases is recommended to restore structural integrity of the columns and anchors. Corrective Action Plan: Deluge system is currently in a redesign phase by KAL Architects & Jensen Hughes Design.\nFinding: Scrubber Waste Restraint. Containers of waste generated by the oxidizer scrubber are\nrestrained with rope or bungee cord.\nRecommendation: Improved restraint is recommended via use of more durable strapping material, and by strapping the containers to a post or bollard that is structurally anchored to the foundation.\nCorrective Action: Issue closed 3 October 2018.\nFi"

      "SummaryText": "en referenced for pipe support requirements. Based on visual inspection of the hypergolic storage sites, it appears that pipe support spacing in several locations approaches, and possibly exceeds, the limits of B31.1 recommendations. Larger spacing between pipe supports is allowed by ASME B31.1 when calculations demonstrate that pipes will not be overstressed. If prior pipe stress calculations are available, they should be reviewed as part of this recommended survey.\nRecommendation: A survey of the unrestrained lengths of piping is recommended at the hypergolic storage sites.\nCorrective Action Plan: Weston has completed evaluation and provided a detailed analysis.\nWeston developed Service Order VAN-WSI-079 to complete the work.\nFinding: Deluge Water Pipe Stands. Much of the deluge water piping is supported on steel pipe\nsupports anchored to, and cantilevered from, concrete foundations. In the past few decades,\nresearch and building codes have acknowledged higher seismic forces for non-building structural components because unlike buildings, there are not ancillary components attached to the structure which dampen the effects of earthquake ground motion. Upon visual inspection, the height of the deluge pipe supports at some areas appears disproportionately tall for cantilevered columns with no bracing.\nRecommendation: Evaluation of this system using current standards is recommended to confirm\nthe system will withstand an earthquake considering current practice and recommendations for nonbuilding structural components.\nCorrective Action Plan: Deluge system is currently in a redesign phase by KAL Architects & Jensen Hughes Design.\nFinding: Tank anchorage. Similar to discussion of the deluge water supports, recent research and\ncode development acknowledges that non-building structural components can experience\nsignificantly higher seismic forces than buildings. At the oxidizer storage tanks, the quantity of\nanchor bolts connecting the tank to foundations appears disprop"

Project Note dated 10 Dec 18 analyzed the\nrequirements of the anchor bolts and proved that the existing bolts are more than adequate for\nthe duty. The calculations in the project note were reviewed and accepted by Range Safety\nprofessional engineer.\nFinding: Non-uniform pipe support heights. Oxidizer pipes running from the tanks to the loading area are supported on cantilevered columns of varying lengths due to the sloped surface of the\ncontainment pit. The stiffness of a cantilevered column is inversely proportional to the length of the column, so shorter columns will attract more earthquake forces than taller columns. If the pipe support columns were designed to resist seismic forces equally, the shorter pipe supports, and their anchorage, may become overstressed in the event of an earthquake.\nRecommendation: A survey of the pipe supports and anchorage is recommended at the hypergolic storage sites.\nCorrective Action Plan: Weston has completed evaluation and provided a detailed analysis.\nWeston developed Service Order VAN-WSI-079 to complete the work.\nVandenberg SFB is communicating action plan updates to the Santa Barbara Certified Unified\nProgram Agency, most recently 23 Dec 2019.

Specific emergency response training for the different categories of base employees--including firefighters, security police, maintenance personnel, facility managers, work-site employees, and even newcomers--overlaps considerably and culminates in periodic base-wide exercises involving the Disaster Response Force. The most recent emergency response training for facility employees was 31 May 2018 which is the base-wide exercise involving the simulated C-17 aircraft crash with a release of 12,000 pounds of fuel.\n\nGeneral Duty Clause: Section 112(r)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990--the General Duty Clause--makes it incumbent on owners and operators of stationary sources to identify hazards and to implement accidental release prevention measures relative to \"any other extremely hazardous substance\" that may not be included in the EPA list of regulated substances. Accordingly, Vandenberg SFB identifies nitrogen tetroxide as a highly toxic substance that is stored on the installation in quantities that could pose a risk to the general public. Nitrogen tetroxide is used primarily as the oxidizer component of the hypergolic propellants employed by various space boosters launched from Vandenberg SFB; it is also occasionally used in smaller quantities as a propellant for satellites launched from Vandenberg SFB and in the Propulsion System Rocket Engine (PSRE) of certain ICBMs tested at the base.\n\nAll aspects of Vandenberg SFB's RMP and CalARP programs--to include OSHA Process Safety\nManagement (PSM) standards and emergency response program planning and training--encompass nitrogen tetroxide storage and operations to the same extent they a"

It should be noted that a review of the base's five-year accident history reveals there have been no reportable accidents involving base employees, contractors, and/or anyone in the general public as a result of exposure to a release of nitrogen tetroxide. Vandenberg SFB fully intends to maintain every aspect of its current accidental release prevention program as it applies to nitrogen tetroxide as long as significant quantities of this substance are stored or used at the base."
