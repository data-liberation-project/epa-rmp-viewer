      "SummaryText": "The Trident Seafoods facility in Motley, Minnesota is submitting this plan to address the USEPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because its refrigeration system contains anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7) in excess of the 10,000-lb. threshold.  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store sea food products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 15,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 9,700 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum fill volume of approximately 85%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains about 6,800 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some piping runs are located outdoors.  The Motley plant is located in a rural setting.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Motley plant is a two-stage system consisting of a discharge (high pressure) side, an intermediate stage, and a suction (low pressure) side.  Five reciprocating compressors and one screw compressor on the high side draw suction from the intercooler at about 35 psig.  This intercooler receives suction gas from the water chiller and a number of room cooler units.  Ammonia liquid which collects"

      "SummaryText": " in the intercooler is pumped to a number of room cooler units and to the low temperature receiver.  The major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas) enters the evaporative condensers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting.  The condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver from which it is fed to the refrigeration equipment.\nFour reciprocating and two screw compressors (boosters) draw suction at a vacuum of about 7 inches of water from the low temperature receiver and discharge to the intercooler.  This low stage of the system provides the suction to the ice maker and a number of freezer unit coolers.  Low temperature liquid which accumulates in the low temperature receiver is pumped to the freezer cooler units.Various safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.   These include pressure relief valves and safety interlocks.  Pressure relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, the high pressure receiver, intercooler, low temperature receiver and other pressure vessels, and suction lines from overpressurization.  Safety interlocks include high pressure, low pressure, and oil pressure cut-outs for the compressors, as well as high level float switches for the intercooler and low temperature receiver."
