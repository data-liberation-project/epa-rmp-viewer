      "SummaryText": "BACKGROUND\n\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. (C&D) is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a diversified line of consumer  and health care products.  C&D began its operations at the North Brunswick Distribution Center in July 2002.  The C&D North Brunswick Distribution Center consists of administrative offices, warehouse storage and shipping areas.  There are no manufacturing activities at this location.\n\nThe North Brunswick Distribution Center includes 152,000 square feet of warehouse storage capacity  and is situated in a commercial zone surrounded by several other distribution facilities.  The warehouse operates five days per week, ten hours per day, and employs 30 people.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe operations affected by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol product in consumer size containers. Product is moved within the warehouse via forklift trucks.\n\nVarious hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the aerosol product.  The hydrocarbons propellants are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials.  The USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release associated with handling hazardous materials.  Additionally, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces accident prevention regulations to protect employees.  The aerosol product propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability. \n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe North Brunswick Distribution Center has no history of accidental releases.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what is defined as  worst case and alternative case release scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is defined as the sudden loss of containment of material in the largest tank, vessel or container.  The worst case scenario assumes the sudden release of aerosol from a case of consumer packaged product.  The alternative release scenario also assumes the release"

      "SummaryText": "of aerosol from consumer packaged products.  The worst case release scenario assumes that several highly unlikely events occur simultaneously such as:\n\n\u00b7 Catastrophic failure of aerosol cans within a case;\n\u00b7 Failure of all automated safety and alarm systems;\n\u00b7 Failure of our trained and experienced operators to respond appropriately; and\n\u00b7 The event occurs during least likely stagnant meteorological conditions.\n\nC&D used USEPA developed guidance (Risk Management Program Guidance for Warehouses) to complete the modeling for both scenarios.  The modeling shows that there would be no impact on the surrounding community from the worst case release scenario.\n\nThese results classify the C&D North Brunswick Distribution Center as a USEPA defined Program 1 facility which presents a minimal risk to the community.  Other Program levels include Program 2 and Program 3.  \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nC&D has developed programs to comply with the required environmental, health and safety standards. \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through process management systems and programs which include: \n\n- Process safety information\n- Pre-startup review\n- Process hazard analysis\n- Compliance audits\n- Operating procedures\n- Accident investigation\n- Training\n- Employee participation\n- Mechanical integrity\n- Hot work permit\n- Management of change\n- Contractor safety\n\nIn addition to our management programs, specially designed systems to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases are also in place.  These include an early  suppression, fast response sprinkler system installed throughout the warehouse.  Aerosol storage racks are equipped with in-rack sprinkler systems.   All of our forklift operators are trained and certified.  Our firewater and sprinkler systems are inspected annually by an outside independent company.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nC&D strives for continuous improvement of its safety pr"

We encourage our employees to suggest changes or improvements that will help minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment including the forklift trucks.  Our systems and programs are routinely audited, typically by an outside company, to evaluate their effectiveness.\n\nWe are presently reviewing  our equipment and procedures recommendations identified during a process hazard analyses performed by an independent expert with the participation of our facility personnel.\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\n\nC&D has an emergency response plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies.  Our plan is tested on a regular basis through exercises and drills.  Our plan has been shared with the  local Office of Emergency Management for North Brunswick Township. \n\nIn the event of an emergency affecting the local community, C&D will work closely with local, county and stage agencies to help ensure public safety.  These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency."
