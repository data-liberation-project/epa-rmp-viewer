This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the CTI Foods facility. \n\n\n\nIt is the policy of CTI Foods to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  CTI Foods maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The policy is reviewed and updated as needed to ensure it remains an accurate reflection of the facility's policies regarding evacuation and the protocol to deal with emergency scenarios.\n\n\n\nCTI Foods coordinates emergency response efforts with the Owingsville Fire Department who serve as the emergency responders.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of CTI Foods to evacuate all personnel and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency.  The CTI Foods ammonia mechanics and engineering personnel will be available for guidance and assistance as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThere is one RMP regulated chemical at our facility -- Anhydrous Ammonia -- that is used in two processes:  System 1 and System 2.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia for System 1 is 6,000 pounds, and that for System 2 is 40,500 pounds.  System 1 was installed and has operated since the commissioning of the facility, and System 2 was commissioned in August 2014 to service expanded production capabilities.  CTI Foods has mad"

The facility processes and manufactures meat products that are distributed to casual eating establishments.\n\n\n\nThe facility is located at just north of the Interstate 64 freeway, approximately 1.1 miles south of the town of Owingsville.  The immediate area is primarily rural, agricultural, and light residential.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements including mechanical, building, and fire codes.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off in accordance with the heat load demands, and are operational 24/7.  The refrigeration systems maintain low temperatures for cold storage and for blast freezing meat products.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe CTI Foods ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the CTI Foods facility utilizes highly trained ammonia refrigeration personnel to conduct the inspections and preventative maintenance tasks associated with each component in the refrigeration systems.  A professional industrial refrigeration contracting company is also available to assist with required inspections and tests and to conduct any necessary repairs to the ammonia refrigeration equipment.\n\n\n\nThe CTI Foods facility, including the ammonia refrigeration processes, were designed with many safety and monitoring features.  These safety features include ammonia leak detectors in the compressor rooms as well as sensors in the cold storage and production areas, and automatic shut down systems that"

The ammonia leak detectors in the compressor rooms are interlocked to: 1) provide alarms for facility operators, 2) shut down the system, and 3) activate emergency ventilation fans.  There are also emergency stop switches located outside the compressor rooms that when manually activated, will shut down the equipment inside the room.\n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration systems are both closed-loop systems without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: \n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\" \n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history during the past 5 years (Dec 2014 - Dec 2019) revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia over the past five years that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in 24 hours, or that meet the EPA reporting criteria for the Five-Year Accident History as specified above.  In addition, there have been no injuries or damage resulting from a release of ammonia at the CTI Foods facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nCTI Foods has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.

In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the local Hazardous Materials Response Team.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center would be called immediately.\n\n\n\nThe CTI Foods facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The Director of Operations will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he is not available.  CTI Foods maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility plus corporate representation.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The facility holds evacuation drills and/or other emergency action plan training at least once per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCTI Foods is committed to the safety of employees as well as neighboring residents and businesses.  Continual evaluations of risks associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment by in-house personnel as well as outside risk management professionals help to limit the possibility of unintended impacts from the ammonia systems.\n\n\n\nItems identified in studies such as the recent Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study, and the Three-Year Compliance Audit will be implemented to further reduce the risks.
