      "SummaryText": "The Wemlinger Water Treatment Plan (WTP) was constructed in 1983.  The facility has undergone two major construction projects for capacity expansion and facility improvements in 1987 and 2003.  During the 2003 rehabilitation of the Wemlinger WTP, significant improvements for the chlorine and other chemical systems were completed.\n\nIn accordance with Titel 40 of the Federal Code of Regulations, Chapter 68, Sections 48 through 60 under Section 112? of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the facility has established a Program 2 Prevention Program as part of the Risk Management Program and Plan.  The overall goal of the program and plan are to reduce the risk to employees and to the public and the environment to injury or death from accidental release of chemicals.\n\nThe faciliity is not limited to Program 1 because a release could affect off-site receptors.  Program 3 does not apply because the facility is not subject to federal or state Occupational Health and Safety Administration Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, nor is it one of the listed industries required by NAICS code to develop a Program 3.  The Prevention Program The Prevention Program covers one process, chlorine in municipal water treatment.\n\nRequirements for the Program 2 Prevention Program include:\nSafety Information\nHazard Review\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMaintenance\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation"
