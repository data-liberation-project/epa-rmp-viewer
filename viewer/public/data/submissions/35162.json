We use vacuum chlorinators, therefore, if a hole develops in a process line, air will be drawn in instead of chlorine leaking out. We require two people when handling chlorine, and we provide chlorine training. We have chlorine leak repair kits and several SCBA?s so we can repair leaks. Leak detectors, which give both local and remote alarms, are used at the plant. If a leak occurs, an alarm sounds at our dispatch center and members of our chlorine response team respond. The detectors also activate a scrubber which is designed to vacuum up the chlorine-contaminated air, neutralize thechlorine and discharge relatively clean air to the environment. Finally, we have an in-house manual entitled Chlorine Handling Procedures and Accidental Release Guidelines, which details our chlorine handling and safety procedures.",

Airport Pumping Station is a water treatment facility with a capacity of approximately 8.0 MGD. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in treating the water, and the maximum quantity stored at this facility is approximately 4,000 lbs.\n\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response:\n\nCWL?s management takes safety issues and regulations very seriously. It is our goal to ensure that all our operations are safe to our employees, the community and the environment. We have a Compliance Specialist who helps monitor applicable safety regulations and coordinates appropriate training related to safety issues. We have an extensive in-house safety program related to chlorine that includes annual training for employees who handle our chlorine. We have also created an in-house manual, Chlorine Handling Procedures and Accidental Release Guidelines, which details our chlorine handling and lead response program. This manual primarily uses safety procedures recommended by the Chlorine Institute. In addition, we have an overall Disaster Plan that includes dealing with a chlorine leak during a disaster. \n\nSome specific safety measures that we have in place are as follows: 1. more stringent specifications than industry standards for our chlorine supplier?s containers; 2. automated monitoring through our SCADA system that results in continuous real-time monitoring for leaks; 3. automated dry scrubbers (installed cost over $100,000/each) that are activated automatically in the event of a leak; 4. chlorine repair kits; 5. multiple SCBA?s; 6. routine training in both chlorine handling/leak response and respiratory training; 7. involvement with the Craighead County LEPC.  \n\nManagement will continue to make chlorine safety a priority at CWL. We spent over $500,000 installing s"

We will continue to look for ways to improve our chlorine safety.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chlorine-Specific Mitigation:\n\nOur release prevention program starts with our chlorine provider. We require them to meet more stringent standards for their cylinders (age, testing documentation, etc.) than is generally accepted in the industry. Next, our chlorine handling procedures require that a minimum of two people are present when handling the chlorine. We have multiple SCBA?s within the company, and they are available on site. The site has a large chain designed to limit movement of the cylinders during an earthquake, etc. We use vacuum chlorinators which means if a hole develops in the chlorine lines the system will pull air in and not let chlorine leak out. This essentially reduces the potential leak sources to the bottle-mount chlorinators and the cylinders themselves. If a leak should occur in either, we have chlorine leak repair kits and the SCBA?s which would allow our personnel to make the necessary repairs. We have chlorine leak detectors that provide a local alarm and a remote alarm via our SCADA system. The remote alarm is received at the CWL Dispatch Center, which is staffed continuously. The leak detectors are tested routinely to ensure they are working properly. Finally, if the detectors sense a leak, they also automatically activate a chlorine scrubber (installed cost over $100,000) that is designed to vacuum the chlorine-contaminated air and neutralize the chlorine. The result is relatively clean air being discharged from the scrubber to the environment.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nCWL has had no reportable releases at this location in the past 5 years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nCWL has a good working relationship with the Craighead County LEPC, and we have provided copies of the CWL Disaster Plan, which includ"

      "SummaryText": "es information on chlorine release and notification. The LEPC and CWL have agreed that CWL shall take the lead  in responding to a chlorine leak at our facilities because our employees  are more experienced and received more training related to chlorine leak repairs. Our personnel have received outside training from our local water district. We have had in-house training classes that covered chlorine handling and leak repair. In addition, our personnel have utilized traiing equipement such as ?dummy? tanks and the standard chlorine leak repair kits to simulate leak repair procedures. If a rel;ease of 10 pounds or more occurs, our personnel are to notify the LEPC, the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, the National Response Center, EPA?s Region 6  office and the Office of Emergency Services (if unable to reach the LEPC). Public notification would be coordinated with the local Police and Fire Departments and the LEPC. In the case of a major leak, local radio and television stations would be involved.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nCWL has greatly improved its chlorine safety program over the last few years by adding more training, installing better process equipment, installing chlorine scrubbers and writing a more detailed policy regarding chlorine. \n\nWhile we will continue to strive to improve our program, at this time no changes are planned."
