The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice making and product cold storage. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration operation is a closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system that consists of two standard designed process loops for the ice making side and the refrigeration side. The system consists of shared compressors, condensers, and main liquid ammonia storage vessels, with secondary storage vessels and icemakers or air-cooling evaporators specific to the systems. Each system has numerous protective controls including process cutouts for motor overload, high temperature and pressure, low temperature and pressure, low oil pressure differential, and high and low liquid levels. Pressure relief valves (\"PRVs\") are installed on all applicable equipment. An atmospheric ammonia release detection system is installed throughout the facility. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, efficient, and reliable refrigerant. The sharp pungent odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Incident involving anhydrous ammonia can be prevented through the facility's program of proper training, knowledge of the equipment and procedures, and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has developed and implemented administrative and engineering controls, as well as training programs to reduce the risk of incidents and employee exposure.\n\n\n\nReddy Ice management is committed to operating safe, compliant, and incident free facilities for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. Reddy Ice-East Point has multiple safeguards pertinent to the ammonia refrigeration system. These include machinery room ventilation systems, pressure relief systems, and failsafe controls that shut down the equipment if operating limits are exceeded, and PLC controls that allow the entire refrig"

Ammonia detection units are installed throughout the location to notify employees or offsite personnel in the event of an atmospheric ammonia release. \n\n\n\nReddy Ice-East Point has also developed an Emergency Action Plan (\"EAP\") for n the event of an emergency. The EAP includes procedures for notifying public and local emergency responders, emergency evacuation of personnel, first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel, use of emergency alarms and equipment, employee training in evacuation and response procedures, and periodic review and updating of the written plan.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM 3\n\nBased on the Reddy Ice-East Point (321) facility's ammonia inventory, t facility has developed a combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (\"PSM/RMP\") Program to address the requirements of both EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA's Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119) regulations. The purpose of the PSM/RMP Program is to provide safe operations and make accident prevention systematic throughout the facility and the closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system. The PSM/RMP Program contains fourteen elements, coordinated through a management system to ensure development, implementation, and integration of the Program's requirements. These elements consist of the following: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Contractor Qualifications, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Planning and Response, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation and ongoing development of the PSM/RMP Program elements. The Operations Manager has been identified as PSM/RMP Program Coordinator, with the overall responsibility for PSM/RMP Program practice "

The Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for portions of the program that are closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. An established safety committee presents a monthly safety meeting and assists in addressing any identified safety concerns for the location.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, Reddy Ice-East Point has conducted a comprehensive hazard assessment, which includes offsite consequence analyses (\"OCAs\") for the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the facility were evaluated based on company and industry history and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program. Potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Reddy Ice-East Point facility has not had an ammonia release that requires reporting as part of a five-year accident history. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nReddy Ice-East Point has also developed an Emergency Action Plan (\"EAP\") for n the event of an emergency. The EAP includes procedures for notifying public and local emergency responders, emergency evacuation of personnel, first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel, use of emergency alarms and equipment, employee training in evacuation and response procedures, and periodic review and updating of the written plan. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\n\n\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Fulton County LEPC and the East Point Fire Department, and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders if needed. The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and "

No additional changes are currently planned. Reddy Ice-East Point operates an ongoing program of facility preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations. As a national company, Reddy Ice continues to implement changes to improve safety and reduce risk at all of it's operating ammonia refrigeration facilities.\n\n"
