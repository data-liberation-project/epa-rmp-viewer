An emergency response program is in place at the facility, which has been coordinated with local officials.  The Sonora Gas Plant is designated as a non-responding stationary source.  The emergency planning and response program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\t\n\n Continuous Safety Improvement Efforts\n\t\n\tWTG\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\t\n-\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, or equipment are considered.\n-\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) review serves as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential process hazards and verification of safeguards, thereby leading to continual improvements in process safety and safe work practices.\n-\tThe Mechanical Integrity program ensures that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n-\tIncident Investigation procedures are in place to ensure that corrective and/or preventative measures are taken as applicable following an incident.  This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance safe work practices are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent the recurrence of an incident.\n-\tInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements with any action items tracked to completion. \n-\tAn annual dialogue with the Upton County LEPC will ensure a readiness to respond"

Residue gas is also transported off-site via the sales pipeline.   \n\n\nThe RMP flammable substances and mixtures stored or processed at the facility are the flammable mixture comprised of methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane, and pentane, which is being processed through the plant; as well as propane, which is used as refrigerant in the cryogenic process. There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  \n\nWTG has determined that the gas plant should be considered one process under the RMP rule.  This facility has one process (as defined by the regulation) consisting of a flammable mixture and propane.  Although the systems containing the flammable mixture and the propane are not interconnected, an incident in one of the systems could trigger a release in the other system, therefore, the two systems are to be considered one process (see definition of \u201cprocess\u201d at 40 CFR 68.3).\n\nWTG has determined that SGP is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the RMP regulation because the nearest public receptor is within the worst-case scenario flammable endpoint radius and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by WTG.  These high standards include:\n\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility, operator training, and intervention.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe SGP is operating under a prevention program that i"

WTG\u2019s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, and emergency response in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and continuous improvement efforts to improve safety at the facility.\n\nNon-Responding Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nWTG owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located near Midkiff, Texas.  The Sonora Gas Plant (SGP) compresses and treats natural gas to produce residue gas (methane) and natural gas liquids (NGL).  After processing, the residue gas and NGL exit the plant via product pipelines.  \n\nPre-treated, sweet field gas enters the plant via a pipeline, is dehydrated, and sent to the NGL recovery plant.  At the recovery plant, gas is routed to a demethanizer tower, which separates it into a residue gas product stream and an NGL product stream.  The NGL stream is purified using an amine treater, which removes carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.  SGP uses a flare to burn gases during emergency/upset conditions, system maintenance, and startup and shutdown.  The flare is also used to burn waste acid gas generated by the amine treatment system.  NGL is then pumped into the sales pipeline for further fractionat"
