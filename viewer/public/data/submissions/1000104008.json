This facility was constructed in 1969 and is used to distribute pre-packaged industrial chemicals and packaging chlorine from railcar into ton and 150-pound cylinders.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The update of this RMP is for:\n1.\tUpdated emergency contacts.\n2.\tIncreased on-site storage limit of sulfur dioxide.\n3.\tUpdated review and audit dates in the Prevention Program and Emergency Response sections.\n4.\tUpdated population density and environmental receptors from worst and alternative case scenarios.\n5.\tUpdated 5-year accident history.  \n6.\tUpdate PHA information.\nThe same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Harcros has a long-standing commitment to safety and protection of the environment where we take a systematic proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.   As members of the National Association of Chemical Distributors we adhere to the principles of Responsible Distribution and are committed to continuous improvement.  Harcros is also a member of The Chlorine Institute, which this facility's emergency response program is based upon their Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.
