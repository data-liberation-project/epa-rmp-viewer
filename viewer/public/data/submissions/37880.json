Accident prevention is the preferred alternative. When a release occurs, we are committed to responding with the maximum of company resources and cooperate with local emergency response agencies. We will provide training and information, as requested, to local emergency response agencies. Corporate and management levels support complete compliance for all safety and environmental laws and are committed to implement a RMP plan and achieve plan goals. We encourage and require employee participation in chemical safety.\n\n1.2 Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nHasa, Inc uses chlorine at its Eloy, Arizona facility. The chlorine is received quantities above the 2,500 lb. regulatory threshold for chlorine. All processes that use the chlorine are classified as regulated process for purposes of the RMP rule. For Hasa, Inc, only the sodium hypochlorite production process uses chlorine and is therefor regulated for RMP purposes. All other processes at Hasa, Inc do not use or have regulated chemicals above the regulatory thresholds.\n\nThe sodium hypochlorite (bleach) manufacturing process reacts liquid chlorine with a sodium hydroxide solution to produce the bleach in a continuous flow reactor. The reaction is controlled and monitored under redundant automatic control monitored by an operator. The bleach is then sent to a bleach filtering system then to storage tanks. The bleach is packaged as needed or sold in bulk tanker quantities for water treatment. Typical water treatment customers use the sodium hypochlorite to treat swimming pools, potable water disinfection or treated sewerage disinfection. Hasa, Inc also packages other water treatment chemicals and inventories and ships others.\n\n1.3 Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe required worst case scenario off-site consequence analysis has been conducted. The specific results"
