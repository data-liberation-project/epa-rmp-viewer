      "SummaryText": "The Central Gas Facility (CGF) is classified as NAICS code 211111, Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas Production.  Prior applicability analysis performed by an earlier operator of CGF demonstrated that the facility was not covered by RMP, due to the A\u00bfnaturally occurring hydrocarbonA\u00bf exemption. While BP Exploration Alaska Inc. (BPXA) concurs with that analysis, a Program 1 plan for the propane refrigeration process is being submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of  stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nCGF is designed to improve overall field gas off-take by recovering NGL and miscible injectant (MI) from the gas and then (together with the Central Compressor Plant [CCP]) compress and return the remaining residue gas into the gas cap of the Prudhoe Bay reservoir.  The NGL and MI products are captured from the feed gas stream using a refrigeration/condensation process.  Current production is approximately 60,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids (NGL) with a portion of that production shipped to Kuparuk oil field for MI injection.  The remaining NGL production is blended with crude oil and sent to Pump Station 1 (operated by Alyeska Pipeline Service Company).  Approximately 350 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd) of MI product is produced for use in the Prudhoe Bay oil field.  When compressed and re-injected into the oil bearing formation, MI lowers the viscosity of the crude oil, allowing it to flow to the well bore more easily.  The overall effect is a significant increase in recoverable oil.  \r\n\r\nCGF utilizes propane in a refrigeration system.  The propane refrigeration system is a closed circulating loop.  Liquid propane is generally manufactured at CGF, stored in the 19-1218 refrigerant storage drum and added as make-up to the 19-1216 surge drum as needed.  The propane refrigerant system includes the following equipment and approximate inventories:\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tThe 19-1218 refrigerant storage drum provides liquid propane storage for make-up.

At normal operating level, the surge drum contains approximately 40,000 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 168,723 lbs.\r\nA\u00bf\tAn economizer system facilitates compression of propane refrigerant in multiple stages, which improves overall system efficiency: \r\no\tAt normal operating level, the LP economizer contains approximately 12,945 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 54,603 lbs.\r\no\tAt normal operating level, the HP economizer contains approximately 16,052 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 67,709 lbs.\r\nA\u00bf\tFour chillers (19-1310, 19-1360, 19-1386A and 19-1386-B) allow for heat exchange between incoming process natural gas and propane refrigerant.  At normal operating levels, a chiller contains approximately 9,333 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 39,367 lbs.\r\n\r\nTotal propane inventory onsite is approximately 710,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe refrigerant storage drum is located along the West edge of the CGF facility pad, slightly North of center.  This orientation provides for better potential dispersion from bimodal Southwest/Northeast winds.\r\n\r\nCatastrophic loss of inventory of the 19-1218 refrigerant storage drum and subsequent vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is the basis for the Worst Case Scenario calculations.
