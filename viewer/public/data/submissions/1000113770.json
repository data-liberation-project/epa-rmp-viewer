The Selma West Oak Street Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Selma, NC. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, No. 2 fuel oil, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum-based additives.\n\nThe Selma West Oak Street Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Marathon believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\nThe Selma West Oak Street Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. Marathon promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that the Terminal has designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances,\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs,\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals,\nD. An overview of the emergency response program, and\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\nA.

Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety systems incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Selma West Oak Street Terminal.\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in two (2) pressure vessels.  The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into blend grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid, analyzers, and PLC.  Process safety controls include vessel pressure relief valves (PRVs), vessel internal excess flow valves, fusible elements (<250 degrees Fahrenheit) fail-safe emergency shutoff valves (ESVs), fill shutoff on the vessels, manual emergency shut-off devices (ESDs) throughout the process and on the video display terminal, pipe hydrostatic pressure reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Selma West Oak Street Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nMarathon's accidental release prevention and emergency planning/response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by regulated substances to its employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68 (enforcement has been delegated to the State of North Carolina), as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119.

Marathon and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, the Selma West Oak Terminal also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of its operating procedures along with engineering and administrative controls to prevent, identify, and contain/control a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and corporate standards,\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.),\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams,\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators (both on-site and remotely),\n-Computerized monitoring and automate process controls,\n-Redundant control systems with an uninterruptable power supply,\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems,\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, and safety devices,\n-Controlled facility access,\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs,\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits, and \n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\nG"
