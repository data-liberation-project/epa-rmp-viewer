      "SummaryText": "Anhydrous Ammonia is used at Dormont Manufacturing to create the atmosphere needed to anneal stainless steel for the production of flexible gas connectors.  The anhydrous ammonia process includes the ammonia storage tank, ammonia dissociators (2), and annealing furnaces (2) along with all associated process piping and monitoring equipment.  The majority of ammonia onsite at any given time is located in the ammonia storage tank which is the only component of the process that has liquefied ammonia.  The tank has a maximum capacity of approximately 7,800 gallons or 42,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  The tank is located outside the facility, along the west wall, surround by a 12 foot privacy fence that is locked at all times.  The tank is supported with two four foot high concrete pillars that set on a concrete pad that is one foot higher than the surrounding pavement.  The tank is surrounded on all sides by a three foot high concrete block containment wall equipped withspecial drainage to prevent the accumulation of rain water while at the same time restricting the flow of liquid from the containment area.\n  \nOnly ammonia gas is pulled from the tank and brought into the facility where it is immediately converted into a 75% hydrogen and 25% nitrogen gas mixture in the dissociators.  Within a few feet of exiting the tank the ammonia passes through an automatic emergency shutoff valve that is tied into the process monitoring system so that the flow of ammonia will be stopped and the tank isolated automatically if there are any issues with process (i.e. power outage, pressure or temperature variation, leak detection, etc.).  The system is continuously monitored for leaks with five fixed sensors, two outside the facility (on on each end of the ammonia tank enclosure) and 3 inside the facility (one by the dissociators and one by each furnace).  In addition to closing the emergency shutoff valve the system also automatically activates alarms within the facility and notifies pe"

Dormont does however realize that there is always the potential for unforeseen issues to arise, therefore, actions have been taken to help reduce the potential impact of a release of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition to the Off-site Response Plan that was developed, and is updated annually, with the Westmoreland County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) steps have been taken to ensure responders are familiar with operations at the facility.  Both the local Fire Department and representatives from the county Hazardous Materials Response team have been provided with specific information on the ammonia process and have been on-site for safety evaluations and response plan meetings.  Dormont representatives played a critical role in developing an emergency communication program for the entire industrial park to ensure the surrounding facilities and residents are aware of emergencies or critical issues.  Dormont provides financial support for the local emergency response organizations and has a representative actively involved as a member of the Westmoreland County LEPC. \n"
