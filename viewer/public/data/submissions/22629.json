Our policy is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, our policy is to notify the Wichita Falls Fire Department  (911)  and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have communicated with the Wichita County LEPC and informed them of the presence of a propane fuel storage tank farm onsite.  Our plant is included in the community response plan.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION:  This facility is a natural gas fired cogeneration plant.  If the natural gas supply is interrupted, propane is used as an emergency backup fuel for three turbines located onsite.  Use of propane as an emergency backup fuel has been required only once since plant startup in 1987.\n\n\nWORST CASE & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of a 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60oF) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite.  Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2.0 inch diameter pipe resulting in a ten minute release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite.  Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  This fa"

We have discussed this policy with the fire department.  Members of the fire department have inspected our propane system."
