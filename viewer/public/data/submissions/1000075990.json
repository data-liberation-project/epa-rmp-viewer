We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  \n\n\n\n(a)  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n3M Tonawanda's policy is to maintain a state of readiness to respond quickly and appropriately to an emergency situation and thereby minimize the impacts on human health, the environment and property.  A state of emergency preparedness is achieved through the application of proper design, installation, maintenance and operation of our manufacturing process and appropriately trained personnel to prevent an accidental release of hazardous materials.  If, despite our best efforts, a release should occur, our trained personnel are at hand to mitigate the effects of the release until the Town of Tonawanda Fire Department and/or Brighton Hazmat emergency response organization arrives. \n\n\n\n(b)  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\n3M Tonawanda manufactures cellulose sponges at a facility located on a 19-acre site within an industrial zoned area of Tonawanda, New York.  The Approximately 27,000 square foot plant includes manufacturing, converting and warehouse facilities and employs approximately 350 people. We use one regulated substance at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  The following regulated substance is used at Tonawanda 3M:\n\n\n\n     Carbon Disulfide\n\n\n\n(c)  3M Tonawanda Program to Prevent Accidental Releases \n\n\n\n3M Tonawanda takes great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA's Risk Man"

Additional mitigation measures we have in place but did not take credit for in our alternative case scenario are: a water deluge system, a sprinkler system, emergency shutdown system, check valves, a manual shutoff system, an automatic shutoff system, alarms, a video camera monitoring system, administrative procedures, and grounding system.\n\n\n\nFollowing is a brief description of the steps we take to prevent accidental releases:\n\n* Process Safety Information - At Tonawanda 3M, we maintain a record of safety information that helps us conduct our operations safely. This information describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with appropriate processes. The information is used in process training for employees and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. The information is reviewed for any appropriate improvements\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis - With the support of 3M corporate specialists, we conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that potential hazards associated with certain hazardous processes are identified and controlled effectively.  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations. These studies are revalidated at regular intervals of no more than five years or whenever significant changes are made in affected operations. Findings from the hazard analysis are presented so that they can be addressed in a timely manner.\n\n*  Operating Procedures - To conduct our manufacturing processes safely, we maintain written operating procedures.

Refresher training is provided. \n\n* Mechanical Integrity - We conduct and document in detail maintenance checks on hazardous process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and instrumentation, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are conducted by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices or other specialized subjects as needed.  Equipment deficiencies are identified so that they can be corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n* Management of Change - We have established written procedures at 3M Tonawanda to manage changes in process materials, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other appropriate employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are notified and provided any needed training. \n\n* Pre-startup Reviews - These safety reviews for new processes and modifications to established processes are conducted as a regular practice at 3M Tonawanda.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing certain equipment into operation. \n\n* Compliance Audits - Utilizing accepted audit practices, we regularly conduct audits to determine whether the procedures identified above are being properly implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future. \n\n* Employee Participation - At 3M Tonawanda, we have found through experience that managing process safety and preventing accidents are team efforts. We strongly encourage 3M employees to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.    \n\n* Contractors - On occasion, 3M Tonawanda hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, 3M conducts a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance.  At 3M Tonawanda, we have a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to 3M processes and the contractor's work.  Contractors are also informed of 3M procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.   \n\n\n\n(d)  Five-year Accident History \n\n3M Tonawanda has had no releases meeting EPA criteria for inclusion in the plan. \n\n\n\n(e)  Emergency Response Plan\n\n3M Tonawanda maintains a written emergency response plan that includes arrangements for immediate response from employees, the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas.
