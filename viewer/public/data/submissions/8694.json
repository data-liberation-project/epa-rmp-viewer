Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \n The Walker Creek Gas Plant primarily uses the Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations. Checklist analysis, performed by trained and knowledgeable personnel is recognized as an extremely thorough hazard evaluation technique. The analyses are conducted by personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The PHA personnel identify and evaluate hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation as necessary. \n \n The PHA findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned during the PHA process.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n \n To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n \n The Walker Creek Gas Plant, located in Taylor, Arkansas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, ethane, propane, butane) from natural gas.  The Walker Creek Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as ethane, propane and butane. \n \n OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n \n The WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 2 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing natural gas liquids(NGL's).  The maximum vessel inventory of 220,000 pounds is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.50 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n \n The ARS for flammable substances at the gas plant is a VCE resulting from the release of NGL's from the overfilling of a the storage vessel.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.14 miles.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n \n \n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n \n The followi"

This summary addresses the elements of the Walker Creek Gas Plant's accident prevention program and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n \n Process Safety Information\n \n The Walker Creek Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Personnel at the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n \n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Walker Creek Gas Plant Operating Procedures Manual. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed at least annually to verify completeness and accuracy. \n \n In addition, the Walker Creek Gas Plant Operating Procedures Manual also contains a section pertaining to the consequences of deviation which provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n Training\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Walker Creek Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through oral tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Walker Creek Gas Plant facilities.  \n \n The overall emergency response program for the Walker Creek Gas Plant is coordinated with the Columbia County LEPC. The Walker Creek Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \n \n PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n \n The Walker Creek Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned over the next few years in response to PHA, safety audit, and incident investigation findings:\n \n7 Installation of  additional overpressure protection plant equipment\n7 Revisions to personnel training programs\n7 Revisions to plant shutdown system"
