The facility has five product lines:  Metal Base - a metal base stamping and glassing operation for incandescent and fluorescent bases; CPI - high-speed precision metal stamping; DPC - oxidation process for CRT components; GTMS - glass to metal seal operation for fuel sensors; and ACS - an audio cable and component assembly department.  The facility has a registered Environmental Management System conforming to ISO 14001.  The facility also has a Safety Management System based on BS-18001.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance handled.  Anhydrous ammonia is ?cracked? through a dissociation process into ?D/A? or dissociated ammonia, which is basically a gas made up of 75% hydrogen and 25% nitrogen.  The D/A gas is used as a furnace atmosphere in the DPC and GTMS areas for heat treating metal components.  The anhydrous ammonia system includes a bulk tank, process piping, various safety and monitoring systems and two electric fired dissociators.  The system is typically unmanned, but is monitored by plant security personnel.  The system undergoes a rigorous safety inspection each month.  Maintenance employees are on staff to respond to any alarms and to maintain the system.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nOSRAM SYLVANIA?s Risk Management Plan provides a unified approach to the prevention of accidental releases of chemicals through the integration of engineering controls, administrative controls and administrative procedures.  All applicable procedures from the USEPA Prevention Program are adhered to in the Risk Management Plan.  The OSRAM SYLVANIA emergency response plans include the preparation of response plans designed specifically for the OSRAM SYLVANIA facility located in York, PA and to the emergency response services that are available in the co"

OSRAM SYLVANIA has emergency responders trained at the 24-hour technician level (OSHA HAZWOPER Standard).  These individuals are trained to respond to the release of anhydrous ammonia and response plans for handling on-site releases of anhydrous ammonia exist.  The emergency response team is well equipped with:\n    Chemical sensing equipment\n    Personal protective equipment\n    Radio communication equipment\n    Offensive and defensive strategy tools and equipment\n    Pre-determined response checklists for Incident Command, Safety/Science Officer and Decon Officer\n    Decon and Emergency Decon equipment\n    Medical supplies\n    All equipment is staged on fully portable carts to enhance response capabilities\n    Chemical detection sensors at the anhydrous ammonia process include a low level alarm, which maintenance or HazMat members will respond to and a high level alarm, which will sound internally over the fire/chemical evacuation system.  All plant employees are trained to respond to a high level anhydrous ammonia release by conducting shelter-in-place activities.\n    Use of the Incident Command system for all OSRAM SYLVANIA emergency response teams (fire, chemical and other situations) use the Incident Command System as a reporting response structure.  Specific response plans include shelter-in-place, evacuation and response for chemical incidents, including the release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS, MECHANICAL INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE AUDITS AND PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe initial Process Hazard Analysis was conducted in 1997 using the FMECA (Failure Mode and Effect Criticality Analysis) method, which met the criteria of 29 CFR 1910.119.  All recommendations from the 1997 PHA have been completed.\n\nIn December of 2003, a second Process Hazard Analysis was conducted using the ?What If?? Method, which also met the criteria of 29 CFR 1910.119.  A total of 67 recomme"

One involves clarification of information from the dissociator manufacturer concerning the retorts (which is a production planning, preventative maintenance item) and the replacement of the roto-gauge on the ammonia bulk tank with the same device, which is a replacement in kind.  Both of these recommendations will be completed by 8/1/2004.\n\nMechanical Integrity Audits are conducted every three years, with the last audit being completed on 9/15/2003.  The most current version of ANSI K-61 is used as the basis for the audit.  Monthly inspections verify the on-going mechanical integrity of the system.  Results of the monthly inspections are reviewed and corrective or preventive actions are taken, based on the results.  A formal corrective and preventive action system is operated and maintained with the facility?s Environmental And Safety Management Systems.  Preventive Maintenance plans are also fully documented and implemented to maintain the integrity of the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\nThorough Process Safety Management Compliance Audits are conducted every three years, with the latest completed on 9/16/2003.  The audit format includes a thorough review of the system and all elements, as well as all systems or procedures that are covered or referred to in 29 CFR 1910.119.  This included the review of 34 programs or documents which have an impact where the failure to properly follow procedures could result in the release of anhydrous ammonia.  Examples of the programs included Process Safety Management, Emergency Response Plans, Troubleshooting guides, Safe Work Practices, Operating Instructions, Calibration and Testing of Monitoring systems, Hot Work and Line Break Permit Programs, Incident Investigations, Outside Contractor Policy, and training documents.
