The facility has five product lines:  Metal Base - a metal base stamping and glassing operation for incandescent and fluorescent bases; CPI - high-speed precision metal stamping; DPC - oxidation process for CRT components; GTMS - glass to metal seal operation for fuel sensors; and ACS - an audio cable and component assembly department.  The facility has a registered Environmental Management System conforming to ISO 14001.  The facility also has a Safety Management System based on BS-18001.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance handled.  Anhydrous ammonia is \u00bfcracked\u00bf through a dissociation process into \u00bfD/A\u00bf or dissociated ammonia, which is basically a gas made up of 75% hydrogen and 25% nitrogen.  The D/A gas is used as a furnace atmosphere in the DPC and GTMS areas for heat treating metal components.  The anhydrous ammonia system includes a bulk tank, process piping, various safety and monitoring systems and two electric fired dissociators.  The system is typically unmanned, but is monitored by plant security personnel.  The system undergoes a rigorous safety inspection each month.  Maintenance employees are on staff to respond to any alarms and to maintain the system.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nOSRAM SYLVANIA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan provides a unified approach to the prevention of accidental releases of chemicals through the integration of engineering controls, administrative controls and administrative procedures.  All applicable procedures from the USEPA Prevention Program are adhered to in the Risk Management Plan.  The OSRAM SYLVANIA emergency response plans include the preparation of response plans designed specifically for the OSRAM SYLVANIA facility located in York, PA and to the emergency response services that are available in the co"

The Emergency Response Plan is also in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe general accidental release and chemical specific prevention program is as follows:\n\tSafety Training for employees who inspect and maintain the system.\n\tEffective, detailed procedures for maintenance, operation and troubleshooting of the system.\n\tPreventive maintenance programs to maintain good mechanical integrity of the system.\n\tThe Management of Change Program identifies potential concerns prior to system changes occurring.\n\tDetailed inspection program identifies potential concerns before they become a problem.  \n\tThe Inspection program includes low level leak detection activities.\n\tThe compliance audit program meets the criteria of OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\tChemical sensors at the bulk tank and in the dissociator room are set to low levels to provide early warning in the event of a release.\n\tChemical specific prevention steps for anhydrous ammonia include: Level A, Level B and Level C Personal Protective Equipment to be used for emergency response and maintenance activities; training of emergency responders and maintenance employees on the toxic and physical properties of anhydrous ammonia, as well as all related procedures and work instructions; the chemical sensing system and other safety systems; training of plant security personnel (who conduct daily monitoring activities) to the OSHA First Responder (8-hour) level.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT RELEASE HISTORY\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nOSRAM SYLVANIA has a comprehensive emergency response plan that includes chemical specific response procedures as well as"

One involves clarification of information from the dissociator manufacturer concerning the retorts (which is a production planning, preventative maintenance item) and the replacement of the roto-gauge on the ammonia bulk tank with the same device, which is a replacement in kind.  Both of these recommendations will be completed by 8/1/2004.\n\nMechanical Integrity Audits are conducted every three years, with the last audit being completed on 9/15/2003.  The most current version of ANSI K-61 is used as the basis for the audit.  Monthly inspections verify the on-going mechanical integrity of the system.  Results of the monthly inspections are reviewed and corrective or preventive actions are taken, based on the results.  A formal corrective and preventive action system is operated and maintained with the facility\u00bfs Environmental And Safety Management Systems.  Preventive Maintenance plans are also fully documented and implemented to maintain the integrity of the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\nThorough Process Safety Management Compliance Audits are conducted every three years, with the latest completed on 9/16/2003.  The audit format includes a thorough review of the system and all elements, as well as all systems or procedures that are covered or referred to in 29 CFR 1910.119.  This included the review of 34 programs or documents which have an impact where the failure to properly follow procedures could result in the release of anhydrous ammonia.  Examples of the programs included Process Safety Management, Emergency Response Plans, Troubleshooting guides, Safe Work Practices, Operating Instructions, Calibration and Testing of Monitoring systems, Hot Work and Line Break Permit Programs, Incident Investigations, Outside Contractor Policy, and training documents.
