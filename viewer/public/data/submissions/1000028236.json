Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at George's, Inc. Further Processing Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Poultry further processing.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for our refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is approximately 49017 lb.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used RMP Comp.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from our Further Processing Plant.  In this scenario 49017 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released from the main receiver.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate in 10 minutes.  The maximum distance of 1.2 miles indicates that as many as9893 people could be affected.\n\n\n\nSeveral alternative releases were also examined and are documented in the plan.\n\n\n\n4.
