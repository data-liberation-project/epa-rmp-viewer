The calculated release rate is 40 pounds per minute with a toxic endpoint of 154 feet, having no off-site impact.\n\n- Methyl Chloride: The alternate release scenario surrounds a release due to a gasket failure on a 1-inch transfer line requiring 5 minutes to abate.  The calculated release rate is 40 pounds per minute with a toxic endpoint of 20 feet at ground level.  However, at 100 feet above ground level, the toxic endpoint is at approximately 640 feet due to the vapor density of methyl chloride.  Regardless, due to neglibile toxicity at ground level, no off-site impact results.\n\n- Epichlorohydrin: The alternate release scenario surrounds a release due to a gasket failure on a 1-inch transfer line requiring 3 minutes to abate.  The calculated release rate is 30 pounds per minute with a toxic endpoint of 227 feet, having no off-site impact.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Janesville plant maintains a rigorous Process Safety Management program, which satisfies all applicable requirements of both OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Rule 40 CFR 68.

      "SummaryText": "Witco Janesville RMP Executive Summary\n\n\nINTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) requirements mandated in Section 112r of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments were promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on June 20, 1996.  These requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A through H.  Under the ARP program, processes with chemical quantities on site exceeding the listed threshold quantities have applicable requirements.\n\nWitco Corporation produces surfactants at the Janesville plant.  As defined by the regulations, the Janesville plant stores the following toxic chemicals in excess of the threshold quantities: ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, methyl chloride, and epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe Witco Janesville plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training, and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  Witco's written safety and environmental policy states that Safety is unequivocally our number one priority.  Witco's Janesville plant has implemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of hazardous chemicals.  In the unlikely event of a release, trained personnel would respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nWitco's Janesville plant is a derivatives-producing facility located at 2001 Afton Road in Janesville, Wisconsin.  The plant is situated on approximately 25 acres on the south side of Janesville in Rock County.  Residential property to the north, Panoramic Packaging, Inc. to the east, farmland to the west, and the Rock River to the south occupy the immediate area surrounding the facility.\n\nDerivatives have been manufactured at the Witco Janesville plant since 1957.  The plant manufactures a variety of fatty nitrogen derivatives using batch reactor pr"

The products are used by manufacturers of soaps, detergents, fabric softeners, and various health and personal care products, primarily for household consumer usage.  The facility employs approximately 87 employees and is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) rule requires the development of accidental release scenarios for the toxic chemicals at our site.\n\nA worst-case scenario and alternate release scenario are designed to evaluate the potential impact to the surrounding community.  EPA defines a worst-case scenario as the complete release of the largest inventory of a chemical over ten minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel the farthest distance at ground level.  It also assumes that none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems is operational.  A worst-case scenario is a highly unlikely event.\n\nGiven the severe guidelines of a worst-case scenario, more realistic alternate release or planning scenarios were also developed to more closely resemble a real world event.  These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow safety systems to be included in the release containment and dispersion calculations.  These alternate release scenarios are useful to local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n \nWorst-Case Toxic Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case toxic release for the Janesville plant would be the catastrophic failure of an ethylene oxide storage tank.  Assuming all safety systems fail in the worst possible weather conditions, and a total release of the entire tank contents of 143,000 pounds in 10 minutes using EPA mandated criteria, the off-site impact is predicted to be up to 8.7 miles as calculated by the EPA's R"

The vessel is also contained within a concrete secondary containment area, equipped with a water deluge system to suppress any ethylene oxide vapors released.  The tank level, pressure, and temperature are continuously monitored by operator-manned control systems.\n\nIn addition, the vessel undergoes routine mechanical integrity inspections, which include piping systems, instrumentation, and unloading facilities.  The facility also maintains a fully trained emergency response team (ERT), available to respond to emergencies 24 hours a day.\n\nFurthermore, this scenario is unlikely to impact up to 8.7 miles as the plant would utilize the water deluge system and emergency response team to minimize the release of ethylene oxide, while contacting off-site responders if the release would impact off-site populations.\n\nAlternate Toxic Release Scenarios\n\nAlternate release scenarios are those which are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternate release scenarios are those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint specified by EPA, which extend past the facility's fenceline.  The facility has utilized EPA's default modeling parameters, and assumed releases at ground level.  All alternate release modeling was performed utilizing EPA's RMP*Comp\u0019 model, which yielded a toxic endpoint of less than 0.1 miles for all scenarios modeled.  In order to determine a more precise distance, the SAFER. Systems TRACE model was used.  This model yielded actual distances reported in feet, and all scenarios modeled resulted in no off-site impact.\n\n- Ethylene Oxide: The alternate release scenario surrounds a release due to a gasket failure on a 1-inch transfer line requiring 3 minutes to abate.  The calculated release rate is 30 pounds per minute with a toxic endpoint of 21"
