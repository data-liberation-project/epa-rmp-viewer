      "SummaryText": "Roehl Cold Storage - Owen, WI is a Public Cold Storage Warehouse.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing for its customer base. This facility was purchased from the previous owner, Brock Cold Storage, previously purchased from Gardner Cold Storage of Pittsville, WI.  A PSM program had been developed, and was recently updated. Employees have been informed that ammonia is on the premise and that a PSM program exists and they have a right to review it. The  refrigeraton system operates as a two-stage, two-pressure system.  The -20F is the low stage for freezer operation and the +20F is the high stage for cooler and dock areas. This facility uses outside ammonia refrigeration contractors for construction and servicing of its equipment.  In-house personnel conduct minor service and documented evidence is maintained in file folders.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there has been no accidental release at this facility.  For emergencies, the facility Emergency Action Plan (EAP) provides for implementing an emergency response.  The response is coordinated with the local Fire Department and local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for assistance."
