Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the concentration and quantity of aqueous ammonia is below the OSHA concentration and threshold quantity.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena is submitting this as a 5-year update.  It is important to note that there have not been any changes to this covered process since the last update.  The Facility has updated all required accident prevention elements in its RMP.\r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Facility stores aqueous ammonia in one 14,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The 14,000-gallon storage tank is vented to a 1,000-gallon storage tank to scrub ammonia emissions.  Aqueous ammonia is transported to this facility via a commercial tanker truck and transferred to the 14,000-gallon storage tank by a Contractor.  The Contractor transfers the aqua ammonia from its commercial tanker truck to the stationary storage tank.  The Facility Process Operators manage the contents in the stationary storage tank and transfers the aqueous ammonia from the stationary storage tank into a Facility or Contractor operated transport truck for delivery to local growers for direct application.  In the field, the Facility Process Operators transfer the aqueous ammonia from the delivery truck into a poly-tank.    \r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative"

      "SummaryText": "consequence analysis were completed for the aqua ammonia storage process. The worst-case scenario release for the Butte City Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released (14,000-gallon).  The release was modeled as if the aqua ammonia tank had a catastrophic failure and the contents were released and contained within the diked secondary containment.  The vapor emission rate of the chemicals was calculated using standard equations recommended by U.S. EPA for such analyses.  The fate and transport of the evaporated ammonia was modeled via a standard U.S. EPA screening air dispersion model, SCREEN3.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a loading or unloading operation.  The vapor release rates and fate and transport of the evaporated ammonia was managed the same as the worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Depot Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Depot Manager is responsible for conducting aqua ammonia process operations in accordance with this RMP and is responsible for the relevant maintenance, training procedures and documentation.  Upon request, a copy of its Risk Management Plan, Contingency Plan, and Operating Procedures will be provided to its contractors and auditing agency.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis is a non-responding Facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the aqua ammonia operations at the Facility.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by the Facility complies"
