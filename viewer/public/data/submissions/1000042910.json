We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents. As a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care. In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our process equipment is designed, constructed and maintained using sound engineering practices and conforms to applicable industry codes and standards, including those of the Chlorine Institute, for equipment used in manufacturing and handling chlorine. We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs designed to ensure site integrity.\n\n\n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Examples of such controls include: 1) installation of pressure safety"

Mitigation measures include installation of isolation valves, automatic shut off valves that limit the amount of chemical released, fire suppression system in areas where flammable chemicals are present, fire fighting equipment in all process areas, fully implemented emergency response plans, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in control rooms, and an alarm system for early notification of a release. If a release occurs, we will use a dispersion model, Systematic Approach For Emergency Response (SAFER) system, and meteorological data from our weather tower to predict the plume direction and , downwind ground level chemical concentrations, and the estimated time at which the plume will reach offsite areas. For significant release, information will be communicated to 911 in case any actions need to be taken by emergency response agencies. In addition, our Community Alert Network (CAN) system provides us the means to alert residents within a 25-square mile area around the plant in case of a release that may impact offsite areas. The 25 square mile area is broken into 8 different zones. The system has the flexibility to alert all of the contacts at once or alert targeted zones based on real time meteorological data.\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant is primarily involved in manufacturing various inorganic and chlorinated organic chemicals.

All of the covered processes fall under the RMP Program Level 3 Category.\n\n\n\nOxyChem's products serve a multitude of vital needs throughout the American and global economies, playing a role in nearly every modern industry and in thousands of products that consumers use every day.\n\n\n\nBesides process equipment, the plant has a number of tanks for storage of raw materials and products, rail car and truck loading / unloading facilities, a laboratory, and a research and development facility. Because we handle large quantities of chemicals, we use a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment. Information on these programs is provided in other sections of this executive summary. We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\n3.0 Key Offsite Consequence Review\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that we provide information about two types of offsite consequence analysis scenarios: worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. There are strict requirements for choosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a result, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative. The purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to provide emergency planners with more information about the chemicals we handle and about their relative hazards. The alternative release scenarios are more realistic than worst-case release scenarios but are still unlikely to happen.  The software program RMP Comp and the look up tables from Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis provided by EPA were used to model the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. \n\n\n\nInformation on the number and type of public and environmental receptors is also provided based"

Information on environmental receptors was obtained from USGS topographic maps, aerial photos and plant maps.   \n\n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and this RMP rule. Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below in Sections 4.1 through 4.12.\n\n\n\n4.1 Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility. These documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees and address important process parameters such as 1) operating limits for the equipment, 2) design basis and configuration of the equipment, and 3) physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our processes. Plant personnel rely on these documents to perform their job functions properly, consistently and in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nChemical information is usually documented in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). MSDSs contain information concerning both the physical properties and the hazards associated with each chemical. This information typically includes: 1) toxicity information; 2) physical data; 3) reactivity and corrosivity data; 4) thermal and chemical stability data; and 5) hazards of mixing substances together. MSDSs are available to all employees, as well as the emergency responders in our community.\n\n\n\nImportant process parameters are also documented and maintained.

Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards. Our hazard assessments focus on preventing incidents, accidents, and injuries to plant personnel and community, and on preventing adverse impacts to the environment.\n\n\n\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses. A team comprising personnel with engineering, process and operations experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process including looking at previous incidents with catastrophic potential, and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences, including possible health and safety effects. The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of engineering and administrative prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary. These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are resolved.\n\n\n\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years. The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved.\n\n\n\n4.3 Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain technically accurate operating procedures that provide clear instructions to our operators to ensure the safe operation of our facility.

Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees. In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits for operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, flows and compositions, consequences of deviating from the safe limits, applicable safety and health information, procedures for preparing equipment for maintenance, and list safety systems such as pressure relief devices, rupture discs, scrubbers, and fire protection systems. Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate.\n\n\n\n4.4 Training\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks. Both classroom and on-the-job training is provided. Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes: 1) a general overview of the process; 2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated safety and health hazards; 3) safe work practices; and 4) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process. Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks. After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\n\n\n\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.

Preventive and predictive maintenance practices keep equipment in good working condition and warn operators and maintenance personnel of problems, allowing proactive repairs to be completed. Preventive measures taken include choosing proper materials of construction (e.g., to prevent corrosion, much of the piping in certain sections of our plant is monel, Teflon-lined or fiberglass rather than carbon steel), use of sealess or double-seal pumps in organic chemical service, and use of water treatment chemicals that will minimize corrosion of process equipment such as heat exchangers.\n\n\n\nPredictive maintenance technologies employed include vibration analysis, thermography, ultrasonic and oil analysis. Vibration analysis is used for early detection of bearing problems on pumps, compressors, fans and motors. Thermography is used to locate problems on electrical equipment. Ultrasonic technology uses sound waves to determine the thickness of tank walls and piping. Oil analysis is a chemical evaluation of oil samples that helps determine the condition of mechanical and electrical equipment. Our inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails. When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel correct the problem and try to identify the root causes of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided.\n\n\n\nOur quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards required for service in our facility. The mechanical integrity system includes: 1) inspection and testing procedures and implementation of these procedures on a regular schedule; 2) procedures for safe work practices; 3) maintenance procedures for various equipment; 4) maintenance personnel training; and"

Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with another valve that meets the design specifications), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that 1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, 2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, 3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and 4) all training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated. The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\n\n\n4.7 Pre-startup Review\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant performs a pre-startup safety review for all new facilities or whenever a change at an existing facility occurs that requires updating the process safety information. This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly. Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that 1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, 2) adequate operating, safety, emergency and maintenance procedures are in place, 3) training for all affected employees is complete, and 4) process hazard analysis recommendations have been addressed and actions required for start-up have been completed.\n\n\n\n4.8 Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant investigates each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, serious injury to employees, the public, or the environment.

Corrective actions resulting from an incident investigation are tracked until they are resolved. Some examples of changes made as a result of incident investigations include limiting inventory of hazardous chemicals in storage tanks, developing new procedures or revising old ones, changing equipment construction material so it is compatible with process chemistry, expanding our reliability group's efforts under the mechanical integrity program, automation of a process using Distributed Control System (DCS) to allow safe shutdown of a process, requiring operators to perform additional monitoring and to document details of product transfers to tanks, use of nitrogen pad in tanks storing flammable materials, and additional training of operators.\n\n\n\n4.9 Employee Participation\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant encourages employees to be involved in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention. Employees are routinely asked to participate in process hazard analyses, incident investigations, management of change hazard analyses, and all other aspects of the prevention program. Employees have access to all information developed as part of the prevention program, and are specifically informed of any changes that occur in their process areas. The various ways employees are involved in the prevention program are documented in a written plan.\n\n\n\n4.10 Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant has established safe work practices that ensure the safety of our employees and that of our contractors. Examples of these procedures include: 1) a hot work permit that is designed to control spark- or flame-producing activities; 2) a permit and procedure to control confined space entry; 3) a lockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during maintenance; and 4) procedures for preparing equipment for maintenance.

All contractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well trained and are able to perform their job function in a safe manner. A contractor's safety record and performance are reviewed during the selection process.\n\n\n\nOnce a contractor is selected, the OxyChem Wichita Plant provides training and procedures to ensure that contractor employees 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) are aware of the hazards associated with the area in which they will be working, 3) understand the emergency response procedures, and 4) report any hazards they find during their work. Our personnel periodically monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.\n\n\n\n4.12 Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nA compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively. Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, typically independent of our facility, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation. The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention. The results of audits are documented, and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  In addition members of the plant and management conduct weekly internal house keeping planned inspections. Follow up items are tracked until resolved. These are scheduled so that every area of the facility is audited four times per year.\n\n\n\n5.0 Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees wit"

The on-site emergency response plan is supplemented by a Corporate Situations Plan. The Corporate Situations Plan generally apply to internal and external communications related to the occurrence of emergency or other significant events, such as major gaseous chemical release, explosion, fire or community demonstration, at the OxyChem facility. This guideline is intended to complement established internal and external, public and private emergency response systems.\n\n\n\nProcedures for maintaining emergency response equipment are also contained in the emergency response plan. Employees receive periodic training in the duties they are expected to perform during an emergency. Affected employees are notified of any change in the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan is coordinated with local emergency responders so that they are aware of the hazards of our processes. We conduct annual Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) and table top drills with the fire department, emergency medical services, 911, county disaster management and the sheriff department. We have annual orientation sessions for new 911 operators. We also actively participate in the local emergency planning commission (LEPC) meetings. Communication channels with local responders are kept open 24-hours per day. This coordination and communication ensures that the public is quickly notified, if necessary, and that action is promptly taken to minimize the consequences of a release.
