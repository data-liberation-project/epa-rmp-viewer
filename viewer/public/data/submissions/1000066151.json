              "Description": "The Jim Bridger Power Plant utilizes a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system that controls nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions.  The system uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Commercial SCR systems using anhydrous ammonia are found on large utility boilers, industrial boilers, and municipal solid waste boilers. The SCR system uses anhydrous ammonia, with the aid of a catalyst, to convert NOX into nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O).  The ammonia storage system became operational in the fourth quarter of 2015.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is shipped and stored under pressure in liquid form, but is used in the SCR system as a vapor. Vaporized ammonia is injected into the flue gas and mixed with the gases upstream of the catalyst chamber.  Flue gas NOX consists primarily of NO and NO2.  The NOX reduction reaction takes place as the gases pass through the catalyst. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is shipped and stored under pressure in liquid form.  A storage tank is considered to have an 85% usable capacity.  A minimum 15% vapor space must always be maintained when filling to allow for expansion.  The Jim Bridger Plant SCR system includes two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, each with a physical capacity of 49,000 gallons. The process controls for the storage tanks are set to always maintain a minimum 15% vapor space when filling to allow for expansion. Therefore, the tanks have an 85% usable capacity. Anhydrous ammonia is stored under pressure in liquid form, and liquid anhydrous ammonia weighs approximately 5.2 lb/gal at 60?F. Therefore, the maximum intended inventory is 83,300 gallons, or 433,160 pounds. \n\n\n\nThe Jim Bridger Plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard due to storing anhydrous ammonia in quantities above the PSM threshold of 10,000 pounds.  To ensure safe operation of the ammonia storage system, the Jim Bridger Plant is implementing a Level 3 PSM program.  Level 3 PSM Program requirements include:\n\n\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Contractor Safety \n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Hot Work Permits\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n?    Emergency Planning and Response\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nPer EPA guidance on RMP submittals, brief narrative descriptions of these Program requirements are provided below.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nPacifiCorp has compiled process safety information into a Process Safety-Risk Management Plan manual to enable the management and staff to identify and understand potential hazards posed by the SCR anhydrous ammonia processes. The manual includes safety information pertaining to anhydrous ammonia, the technology of the SCR anhydrous ammonia processes and safe operation of equipment in the processes.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nPacifiCorp performed a process hazard analysis (PHA) for the Jim Bridger Plant SCR anhydrous ammonia system.  The PHA applied the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique, which is a systematic review of a process or operation that identifies deviations from the process design or operational intent which could lead to undesirable consequences, including hazards and operability problems.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nPacifiCorp has an established system of written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safe and effective operation of the Jim Bridger Plant, including ammonia handling and storage equipment. The written operating procedures address all of the following operating phases: (a) startup; (b) normal operations; (c) temporary operations; (d) normal shutdown; and, (e) startup following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown. The operating procedures provide acceptable operating limits which have been established in consideration of the consequences of deviation, and provide steps required to correct or avoid operating deviations. The written operating procedures also address safety systems and their functioning.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nAs a component of the established management system, PacifiCorp routinely consults with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of process hazards analyses and on the development of the other elements of process safety management. Employees and their representatives have complete access to process hazard analyses and to all other information required by regulations.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nPacifiCorp provides training to all employees who will be operating anhydrous ammonia process systems and equipment. The training emphasizes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations, including shutdown, and the safe work practices applicable to employee's job tasks. PacifiCorp provides refresher training every three years to all employees who are or will be operating anhydrous ammonia process systems and equipment.\n\n\n\nContractor Safety:\n\nPacifiCorp has developed and implemented safe work practices, as required in the operating procedure requirements, to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employers/employees in the SCR anhydrous ammonia process areas. In addition, PacifiCorp periodically evaluates the performance of contractors in fulfilling their safety and health responsibilities. As part of PacifiCorp?s existing contractor safety program, contractors are informed of the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractor?s work and the SCR anhydrous ammonia processes. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review:\n\nPrior to the introduction of anhydrous ammonia into any tanks, components, equipment or systems, PacifiCorp has conducted pre-startup safety reviews.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nPacifiCorp has a preventative maintenance program with written maintenance procedures for the Jim Bridger Plant. The maintenance procedures have been established to ensure the on-going mechanical integrity of process equipment, including SCR and anhydrous ammonia process equipment.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits:\n\nPacifiCorp has an established Safety and Health Procedure to issue hot work permits, or ?burn permits?, for hot work operations conducted on or near covered processes. The Burn Authorization Procedure is established in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.251 thru 1910.255. The procedure has been updated to address hot work on or near processes that involve Highly Hazardous Chemicals, specifically anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nPacifiCorp has existing, established written change management procedures that are applicable to the Jim Bridger Plant SCR process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures, including anhydrous ammonia systems and equipment.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nRelevant to anhydrous ammonia, a catastrophic release is a major uncontrolled emission of anhydrous ammonia that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment. PacifiCorp will initiate an incident investigation of any catastrophic release, or any incident which could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release, as quickly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  PacifiCorp and the Jim Bridger Plant personal will promptly address and resolve the findings and recommendations of the incident investigation report. Any resolutions and corrective actions will be documented and appended to the incident investigation report. PacifiCorp will review the report as well as the resolutions and corrective actions with all affected personnel, those whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings, including contract employees where applicable.\n\n\n\nEmergency Planning and Response:\n\nPacificCorp has prepared emergency response procedures have been developed according to the provisions of 40 CFR 68.95 and 29 CFR 1910.119(n) (which incorporates 29 CFR 1910.38, and 29 CFR 1910.120(q) by reference), and includes procedures to respond to emergencies involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nPacifiCorp will conduct compliance audits at least every three years, as required by the PSM regulations. The compliance audits will be conducted by a person knowledgeable of the SCR and anhydrous ammonia processes to verify that the procedures and practices developed under the OSHA PSM regulation are adequate and are being followed.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Jim Bridger Power Plant near Point of Rocks, Wyoming.  The power plant utilizes a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system which controls nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions.  The SCR uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Commercial SCR systems using anhydrous ammonia are found on large utility boilers, industrial boilers and municipal solid waste boilers. The SCR system uses anhydrous ammonia, with the aid of a catalyst, to convert NOX into nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O).  The SCR requires an ammonia storage system.  The ammonia storage system became operational in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\n  \n\nThe amount of anhydrous ammonia stored in the system is expected to exceed the 10,000 pound threshold set forth by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for filing an RMP.  Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the EPA as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention program is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP regulations of those two agencies. These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and to minimize the negative consequences should an accidental released of ammonia occur.\n\n\n\nTo ensure safe operation of the ammonia storage system, the Jim Bridger Plant is implementing a PSM program that looks continuously at possible changes to the ammonia storage system that would improve safety.  The PSM program also includes a comprehensive analysis of the ammonia storage system and operator training that is designed to ensure safe operation of the storage system.  Part of the training also includes procedures for notifying local emergency responders in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe RMP submittal requires a five-year accident history of the ammonia storage system at the power plant.   So far, there is no accident history to report for this Rev. 6 RMP submittal.  \n\n"
