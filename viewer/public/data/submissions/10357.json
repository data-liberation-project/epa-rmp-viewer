(R&M), hereafter referred to as Sunoco, we believe that excellent performance in health, environmental and safety goes hand in hand with operating reliability, and that outstanding performance in both areas is required to achieve financial success.  Our company adheres to the guidelines of the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES)--a comprehensive environmental code of conduct for corporations.  The Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery plays a major role in supporting this environmental commitment.  The refinery is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees and the community.   We promote health, environment and safety through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n A description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental\n  chemical releases\n An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n An overview of our emergency response program\n The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n The detailed information (data elements) about our risk management program  \n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery is located on approximately 1000 acres on the east bank of the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia.

Today, it is operated as a fully integrated petroleum refining complex capable of processing 330,000 barrels per day of crude oil into various petroleum products including: gasoline, home and industrial heating fuels, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), residual fuel and a number of petrochemicals such as benzene, propylene, and cumene.  The types of processing units in operation at the refinery include: atmospheric and vacuum crude distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, distillate desulfurization, alkylation, sulfur recovery, petrochemical recovery, and gasoline treating and blending.  In support of these processes, the refinery also operates steam generation, water treating, wastewater treatment, tank car and truck loading facilities and numerous intermediate and finished product storage tanks.  \n\nSunoco also owns and operates the 211 acre Schuylkill River Tank Farm (SRTF) located on the west bank of the Schuylkill River, opposite the refinery property.  The facility functions only as a product storage and shipping area and contains no refining units.  On-site are numerous intermediate and finished product storage tanks, an API-type separator, gasoline blending facilities, and an LPG tank car and truck loading area.\n\nOur refining processes use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\n\n Hydrogen fluoride - 396,000 lbs* - used as Alkylation Unit catalyst\n Propane - 2,880,000 lbs - stored for commercial fuel sales\n Butane - 32,200,000 lbs - used as a gasoline blending component\n Isobutane - 7,200,000 lbs - used as a gasoline blending component and intermediate feedstock\n Flammable mixture (contains: propane and propylene) - 1,320,000 lbs -  used as a petrochemical\n  feedstock\n Flammable mixture (may contain: 1-butene, 2-bute"

Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nThe RMP rule requires that we provide information on the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures employed to limit exposure distances for each case.\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThis highly improbable scenario involves the catastrophic rupture of a storage drum containing 396,000 lbs (47,124 gallons) of hydrogen fluoride.  This quantity is the maximum amount of hydrogen fluoride held in the Hydrogen Fluoride Alkylation Unit (HFAU) storage drum during a Plant Maintenance Turnaround.  These planned Turnarounds occur approximately once every three years for a six week period; they involve transferring the unit's entire acid inventory into one vessel, so that extensive maintenance may be performed on the operating vessels.  The acid drum is a 1 5/8 inch thick high grade steel vessel equipped with indicating instruments and pressure safety relief valves.   \n\nEPA's \"Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance\" was utilized to predict the release consequences.

The release occurs during the worst possible weather conditions (low wind speed, low humidity).  As an absolute worst case release, this event would have offsite consequences, reaching a 20 ppm toxic concentration at a significant offsite distance.  The OCA guidance does not permit the use of active mitigation systems to minimize the release.  Though no accident prevention or mitigation measures were applied to our worst-case scenario, prevention programs do exist to minimize the impacts.  Our HFAU acid equipment is designed, maintained and tested per American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 751 (API RP-751).  API RP-751 recommends design, maintenance and testing criteria that, in general, exceeds that applied to other refinery processing units.  The HFAU is also equipped with a multitude of mitigation systems including: HF sensing detectors, emergency isolation valves, water cannons, television surveillance cameras, spill containment and a rapid de-inventory system.  A combination of these prevention programs and our emergency planning and response programs would significantly decrease the probability and impacts of a release.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThis more likely scenario involves a hydrogen fluoride leak in the piping between two acid vessels in the HFAU.  Facility Engineers and Operators developed the hypothetical scenario after lengthy discussions, and a review of the unit's mechanical integrity, operating and accident history.  The technical team postulated, that as a result of corrosion, a small leak could develop in the miter joint of a 1/2 inch thick acid pipe between two acid vessels. \n\nThis release scenario was simulated using a commercially available and industry recognized computer model called PHAST (Process Hazard Analysis Software Tool).

The following accident prevention and mitigation measures were applied to the scenario to minimize consequences of the release.  The unit's HF sensing detectors and television surveillance cameras would immediately alert operating personnel that a release had occurred.  At this time, the emergency isolation valves and the rapid de-inventory system would be activated to evacuate the acid out of the leaking pipe to a storage drum, this procedure would limit the release to a 24 minute period.  During the de-inventory the water cannons would be activated to knockdown approximately 90% of the released vapor.

For this reason, our flammable worst case scenario could involve the catastrophic rupture of any one of four butane storage spheres containing inventories of 1.5 to 9.5 million lbs of butane.  \n\nEPA's \"Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance\" was utilized to predict the release consequences.  The OCA guidance is formatted in \"Look-up tables\" that predict the distance to a 1 psig explosion overpressure after the instantaneous vaporization and ignition of the entire liquid inventory of the sphere.  This instantaneous vaporization of these large liquid quantities of butane make these scenarios highly improbable.  The release occurs during the worst possible weather conditions (low wind speed, low humidity).  As absolute worst case releases, these events would have offsite consequences, reaching a 1 psig explosion overpressure at significant distances.  The OCA guidance does not permit the use of active mitigation systems to minimize the release.  Though, no accident prevention or mitigation measures were applied to the worst-case scenarios; prevention programs do exist to minimize the impacts.  These storage spheres are built to a national code (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) and are routinely inspected, tested and maintained by trained personnel.  All of the storage spheres are equipped with redundant pressure safety relief valves, level and pressure indications and alarms, and automatic or manual water spray systems.  Three of the spheres have automatically activated emergency shutdown valves and hydrocarbon sensing detectors.  Plans are under review to install these systems on the fourth sphere.

The release was modeled using operating data from the incident investigation, and typical meteorological data collected at the refinery.  Other than the activation of the PSV, no other accident prevention or mitigation measures were simulated in the computer model.

A management system assigns PSM responsibilities to specific individuals.  The fourteen elements of the PSM program listed below constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\n\nPSM Prevention Program Elements \n\n Process Safety Information\nA Process Safety Information (PSI) manual is produced for each PSM-covered process and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process.  The manual lists the hazards of the chemicals used or produced by the process and provides information on the technology and equipment in the unit.\n\n Process Hazards Analysis \nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHA's) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM.  These comprehensive studies are used to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the process units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified.  Results of the PHA's are documented in manuals that are maintained onsite for the life of the processes.  The manuals are duplicated and made available to personnel.\n\n Operating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery processes.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, provide clear step-by-step instructions on the safe and environmentally sound operation of each process unit.  Procedures exist for operating duties during normal modes of operation as well as for emergency response and shutdown scenarios.   \n\n Training\nThe Training Department provides classroom and on-the-"

On-the-job training provides an opportunity for the employee to practice actual duties and responsibilities.  Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n Mechanical Integrity\nThe mechanical integrity of PSM equipment is routinely monitored, inspected and tested to make sure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized.  The Mechanical Integrity Department employs both industry and company standards to evaluate equipment condition.  PSM equipment is also maintained according to written maintenance procedures by a trained maintenance staff.   \n\n Management of Change\nWritten procedures have been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures or facilities that affect a covered process.  The Management of Change procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement the program.  Results of the Management of Change process are documented, maintained and made available to all personnel.         \n\n Pre-startup Safety Review\nPre-startup Safety Reviews are performed by experienced teams in order to confirm that new or modified process facilities are safe to operate.  The unit's construction specifications, emergency plans, and employee training and procedure requirements are reviewed and documented before placing the unit in operation.\n\n Compliance Audits\nA formal evaluation and certification of the PSM system is conducted at least every three years by a Corporate audit team.  In the refinery, the Process Safety Coordinator is responsible to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the PSM system are being followed.\n\n Incident Investigation\nIncidents that result in, or could reasonably have caused, catastrophic release,"

The published reports are shared with employees.\n\n Employee Participation\nEmployee participation is based on the principle that employee involvement in various areas of PSM is key to maintaining a Process Safety system that has an \"our\" attitude.  Employees are involved in: Health and Safety committee activities, safety meetings, Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\n\n Hot Work Permit\nHot work permits are issued for any work that could create a source of ignition on or near a PSM-covered process unit.  The permit describes work being performed, authorized dates and all fire prevention and protection requirements.       \n\n Contractors\nThe refinery employs contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased \nmaintenance or construction activities.

The most recent accident occurred on March 13, 1997, to an Operator who was cleaning a filter in a non-acid flush system.  A small amount of HF was entrained in the system and upon release burned the Operator on the neck and arm.  The second accident occurred on December 15, 1996, while a mechanic was opening a flange on a plugged line.  A small quantity of  HF unexpectedly drained out and burned the mechanic on the knee.  Another accident occurred on October 06, 1996.  During Turnaround maintenance activities, a temporary plug blew out of a leaking exchanger that was pressured up with nitrogen.  The nitrogen was entrained with some HF left in the vessel after the cleaning procedure.  A mechanic standing in front of the plug was  burned on the neck by the released acid vapors.  The final accident occurred on October 14, 1995, to an Operator who was checking the pH of a condensate (water) vessel.  As the Operator reached up to test the sample stream, hot condensate with entrained acid dripped on his arm.  In all four cases the employee was not wearing adequate HF protective gear.
