This company strives to maintain a safe and healthy work place.  The company's manger and employees have made every effort to plan the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOur plant consists of one 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank and when filled to 85% capacity will hold approximately 132,000 pounds.  With the addition of 20 nurse tanks with a capacity of 88,000 pounds makes the company's total capacity of 220,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case and the alternative release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with our local first responders as part of an on-going training program.  More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThis company maintains and operates their NH3 plant in strict accordance with all state and local authorities.  The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement.  Changes or improvements in the facility's equipment will be acted upon immediately following the enforcement agency (KDA's) request, or as found to be necessary by our maintenance staff.\n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site specific operating procedures, plant maintenance and the employees are competency tested over the training material.  Each employee uses goggles and glove during ammonia operations, as well as always providing plenty of emergency safety water during nurse tank loading operations.\n\nWith the above-mentioned training in mind, it makes it very easy to report that absoluteyly no injury accidents or property damage has occurred as this facility for the past five years.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees"
