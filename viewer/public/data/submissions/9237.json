Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCentral Cooperatives, Inc. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment includes an accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the storage and transfer of ammonia (anhydrous ammonia) at our facility.  There are safety devices and controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur we  coordinate with the Odessa Fire Department and Odessa Police Department who will provide emergency personnel  to help control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is Agriculture & Farm Supply.  Anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) is a regulated substance and is present at our facility.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor.  Anhydrous ammonia is the common name.  Ammonia is the chemical name and the chemical formula is NH3.  It has a boiling point of -28 degrees Fahrenheit and is liquefied under pressure.  It is transported and stored as a liquefied compressed gas.  (The Department of Transportation considers anhydrous ammonia as a nonflammable gas and as an inhalation hazard.)  We store anhydrous ammonia in pressurized vessels at our facility.  It is later transferred to 1,000 gallon portable tanks for transportation to the farmer.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as fertilizer for agriculture crops.\n\nWe have one storage tank. It has a water capacity of 18,000 gallons and could hold 93,000# of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo pe"

      "SummaryText": "rform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class would be the rupture of the largest tank and the release from Anhydrous ammonia bulk.  The scenario involves the release of 93,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 4.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario would be the failure of the three inch piping and in addition the failure of the excess flow valve and the release of anhydrous ammonia.  The scenario involves the release of 93,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.81 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility complies with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.      The following section describes the release prevention program for this storage facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCentral Coop and the Missouri Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Weights and Measures has inspected the equipment and design of thi"

These reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.  There have been no such incidents.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCentral Coop believes that safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views about accident prevention and recommend improvements.\n\nContractors\nCentral Coop hires contractors for specialized maintenance and construction activities.  An evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is carried out.\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nThere has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nCentral Coop has a written emergency response plan for the accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes  aspects of emergency response including  notification of local emergency response agencies.\n\n7.
