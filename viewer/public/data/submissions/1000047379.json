This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Gaylord Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in two interconnected 30,000-gallon tanks, nineteen 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, seven 2,000-gallon nurse tanks, and twenty-seven 1,450-gallon tanks at our facility in Gaylord, Minnesota.  The maximum amount stored at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 112,328 gallons (578,037 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel (two 30,000 interconnected tanks) at our facility contains 262,446 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\r\n\r\n3.\tWorst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \r\n \r\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nUnited Farmers Co-op maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment d"
