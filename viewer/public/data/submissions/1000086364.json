(Manteno Dawn Foods) facility located at 1340 Sycamore Street in Manteno, Illinois for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?    Introduction;\n\n?    Manteno Dawn Foods policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\n?

Manteno Dawn Foods Policies to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Manteno Dawn Foods; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Manteno Dawn Foods is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Manteno Dawn Foods' policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur.

Facility Identification\n\nThe Manteno Dawn Foods facility is located at 1340 Sycamore Road in Manteno, Illinois.  The facility is a producer of custom and branded snack cakes and muffins primarily for retail distribution. \n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311813. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients and products.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating baked goods ingredients and products. \n\n\n\nThe approximate ammonia charge for the refrigeration system has been calculated at 12,951 pounds. The refrigeration system is used to cool process rooms, holding freezers, coolers, docks, and blast freezers.  This refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a two (2) stage evaporation/condensation cycle.  The \"low pressure\" equipment includes one (1) spiral freezer and two (2) storage freezer evaporators, one (1) low temperature pump receiver (V-4) with ammonia pumps (AP1 and AP2) and oil pot (V-5), and two (2) low temperature booster compressors (RC-1 and RC-2).  The \"high pressure\" equipment includes two (2) +60 - 70 muffin room evaporators, three (3) +60 - 80 autobake cooler evaporators, one (1) +40 finished product staging evaporator, one (1) +40 vestibule evaporator, two (2) +70 dry bulk cooler evaporators, one (1) +70 cup room evaporator, one (1) water chiller, two (2) +60 - 70 tempering room evaporators, two (2) +60 - 70 receiving dock evaporators, and two (2) +60 - 70 cookie mixing room cooler evaporators, one high temperature pump receiver (V-2) with ammonia pumps (AP3 and AP4) and oil pot (V-3), two"
