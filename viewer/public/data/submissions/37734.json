Company employees participate in hazard analysis and incident investigations and are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\n\nOur company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Only contractors with acceptable safety programs are approved to perform work at the site.   Hampshire Chemical Corporation has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\n\nHampshire Chemical Corporation prioritizes accident prevention to ensure the safety of our operations.  These efforts have resulted with the minimization of accidental release in the past five years and the prevention of any impact on the community from any accidental release.\n\nThere has been only one accidental release of a regulated substance from our facility within the last 5 years that meets the criteria for the five-year accident history.  This release took place on 08/29/2000 and involved 2016 lb. of Formaldehyde (solution).  No deaths or injuries occurred offsite as a result of this accident.  Onsite, there was one injury.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, onsite evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies. \n\nTo ensure proper functioning, we perform quarterly drills of our plan.  Our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nNashua SARA Committee is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  \t\t\t\n\nSome of the steps we have taken to continue to improve safety at our facility include: adoption of The Dow Chemical Company's U.S. Area Safety Standards, adoption of Dow's Fire & Explosion Index Program and our Process Hazard Analysis work process, and reduction of on-site inventory of hazardous substances.  We intend to continue the reduction of hazardous substance inventories and to make process modifications, where practical, to reduce process risks.\nT:\\Daisy\\RMP Documents\\RevisedRMPExecSum.doc"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Hampshire Chemical Corporation, Nashua, New Hampshire Facility\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Hampshire Chemical Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of all substances.  We are also coordinated with Nashua Fire & Rescue, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the production of industrial organic and inorganic chemicals.  The Facility falls under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) 325188 and 325199 and manufactures shampoos and sarcosines primarily on a batch basis.  The plant's entire chemical manufacturing process operations are located at one contiguous facility under common ownership and control.  The facility operates a 3-shift operation running 24 hours/day, Sunday night through Friday night.  We have six substances regulated by the Risk Management Program.  These substances include Hydrocyanic Acid, Formaldehyde (solution), Ammonia (anhydrous), Phosphorus Trichloride, Methylamine (solution) and Ammonia (aqueous). \n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrocyanic Acid at our facility is 380,250 lbs.  The maximum inventory for 44% Formaldehyde solution is 324,000 lbs.  The maximum inventory for 40% Methylamine is 447,929 lbs.  The maximum inventory for Anhydrous Ammonia is 230,062 lbs.  The maximum inventory for 29.4% Aqueous Ammonia is 247,500 lbs.  The maximum inventory for Phosphorous Trichloride is 108,216 lbs.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including adminis"

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of Hydrocyanic Acid from the SARCOSINE - Glycolonitrile Process.  In this scenario, a sizeable quantity of Hydrocyanic Acid is released from the railcar.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity is 100% of the maximum capacity of the source. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release from Anhydrous Ammonia storage.  The scenario involves the release anhydrous ammonia from a relief valve for a duration of 1 minute. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrocyanic Acid involves a release from SARCOSINE - Glycolonitrile Process.  The scenario involves the release of smaller quantity of Hydrocyanic Acid.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minute.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by continuously manning the operation. \nThe alternative release scenario for Phosphorus Trichloride involves a release from HAMPOSYL-L process.  The scenario involves the release of 858 lb. of Phosphorous Trichloride.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 40 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario.

In this scenario 150,200 lb. of 40% Methylamine is released.   It is assumed that the entire quantity is released and evaporates and the vapor cloud finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.
