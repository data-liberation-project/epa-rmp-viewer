The refrigeration system required for this business is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program, and as such, the corporate and local management staff in cooperation with local officials have implemented all elements of the RMP. In conjunction with the RMP, elements required by OSHA's Process Safety Management program have been incorporated into our program. In so doing, the nature of the risks posed by our facility to our community has been evaluated and safety measures have been taken to minimize such risks. The safety and accident prevention program includes a two level alarm/detection system which activates a plant wide alarm, disables refrigeration equipment, activates the ventilation system and notifies plant personnel. This system also detects abnormalities in the refrigeration process and notifies plant personnel. In May, 2004, a computerized system was installed to provide continuous monitoring of refrigeration equipment and processes. As identified through the Mechanical Integrity and audit elements of RMP, refrigeration equipment and lines have been upgraded or replaced as needed to minimize the risk of a release. Insulation on pipes and equipment was replaced to meet currect standards. All refrigeration piping and equipment have been labeled to indicate the process chemistry. Standard Operating Procedures have been written for the operation of all refrigeration equipment and processes. These are reviewed annually with affected employees. Management of Change protocol is followed when changes are made to the system. Incidents of concern related to the refrigeration system are investigated and changes made as needed to minimize similar issues in the future. Protective guards have been installed around refrigeration equipment and piping located in high powered lift use areas. A keyless security system has been installed to minimize the risk of unauthorized access"

Two plant employees attended a week long refrigeration class, in addition, employees receive yearly training in the RMP requirements and its application to our facility. Under the direction of the Great Falls Fire Department and Cascade County LEPC, three mutual response drills have been conducted. Another such drill is scheduled in 2004. Meadow Gold Dairy has also been included in the LEPC's response program. A written emergency action plan is maintained by the company with annual reviews and training conducted for all employees. In 2004, the ventilation sytem for the engine room will be upgraded to meet standards. During the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of refrigerant. Plant management, as well as, senior corporate management is committed to the safe operation and implementation of safe procedures at this facility."
