      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe DuPont Washington Works site adheres to Corporate policies.  For safety and environmental incidents, the policies could be summarized as follows:\n\n  -We believe all safety and environmental incidents are preventable.\n  -Our goal for incidents is zero.\n  -We are prepared for emergencies and we will provide leadership for our local communities to \n    help in their emergency preparedness.\n\nCorporate policies are embodied in numerous Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) manuals as well as DuPont Engineering Standards.\n\nAt Washington Works, SHE policies and procedures are also documented in the Washington Works SHE Manual.  Various procedures throughout the manual deal specifically with Process Safety Management elements to prevent incidents from occurring.  It is the responsibility of every employee and contractor working on our behalf to comply with these procedures.  It is management's responsibility to educate and train employees so they may understand and comply with the procedures. \n\nIf an emergency were to occur due to a release, the response program for the site is documented in the Washington Works Emergency Control Organization (ECO) Manual.\n\nBoth the Washington Works SHE and ECO manuals are available for review by all employees.\n\nFacility Description\n\n The DuPont Washington Works site consists of approximately 2000 acres located 5 miles south of Parkersburg, WV.  In addition to manufacturing areas and associated support facilities, the site also has areas dedicated to wildlife habitat and a local historic landmark that the site leases to the state for use by the public.  \n\n The site uses the following EPA regulated chemicals at levels above their threshold quantities:\n\n Toxics\n chlorine\n formaldehyde\n hydrochloric acid\n\n Flammables\n ethylene\n tetrafluoroethylene\n\nWorst-case Toxic Release Scenario\n\n The worst-case toxic release scenario for the Washington Works site involves the release of a"

      "SummaryText": " storage tank containing hydrochloric acid with no mitigation assumed.  The release has off-site impact as determined by using EPA provided software (RMP*Comp).  \n\n This release is highly unlikely due to the tank's materials of construction, periodic vessel inspections, and available de-inventorying capacity in the case of an emergency.\n\n Worst-case Flammable Release Scenario\n\n The worst-case flammable release scenario for the Washington Works site involves the release of ethylene from a tube trailer. The release has off-site impact as determined by using EPA provided guidance documents and equations.  Based on the results and location of the tube trailer, no residences are within the area of impact.\n\n The release of the tube trailer contents is highly unlikely due to the design and inspection of the tube trailer in accordance with DOT regulations, the materials of construction for the transfer piping, and gas detection with early warning signals.\n\n Alternative Toxic Release Scenarios\n\n There are three alternative toxic release scenarios for the Washington Works site.  The chemicals involved include hydrochloric acid, formaldehyde, and chlorine. The scenarios use the best engineering judgement as to a more likely scenario for the processes involved with no mitigating factors to minimize their impact.  The meteorological conditions are those given in the EPA Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Manual for alternate release scenarios.  All scenarios have off-site impact as determined by the EPA guidance manual tables and RMP*Comp software.\n\nFor chlorine, the release involves shearing off a discharge valve on a cylinder.\n\nFor formaldehyde, the release involves release of material via a safety relief device due to high pressure that subsequently becomes stuck open.\n\nFor hydrochloric acid, the release involves the failure of a transfer hose on a shipping trailer.\n\nAlternative Flammable Release Scenario\n\n The alternative flammable release scenario developed for the Wash"

The release has off-site impact as determined by using EPA provided guidance documents and equations and assumes no mitigating factors to reduce the impact.  Based on the results and location of the tube trailer, no residences are within the area of impact.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n The Washington Works site manufacturing areas follow the requirements set out in DuPont Corporate SHE Standard S21A, Process Safety Management.  This standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  The standard involves the following activities listed under the following headings:\n\nSafety in Design ...\n- A documented process technology system covers hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and \n  process design basis.\n- Extensive active and passive preventative and mitigating systems are strategically located.\n- Applicable codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n- Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity.\n- Quality Assurance ensures fabrication in accordance with design specifications and proper assembly.\n\nSafety in Maintenance...\n- Maintenance personnel are trained and experienced.\n- Contractors are trained and qualified.\n- A work permit system controls hazards.\n\nSafety in Operations...\n- Operators are trained and job qualified.\n- Technical resources are available and utilized as required.\n- Operators follow approved procedures.\n\nSafety through Auditing...\n- Routine safety inspections are conducted.\n- Corporate and independent audits and reviews are conducted.\n- Process Hazards Analyses are conducted.\n- Safety critical equipment is set up on a periodic inspection frequency to ensure ongoing mechanical \n   integrity.\n- Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted prior to starting up any new or modified equipment.\n- Quality assurance of critical equipment ens"

No deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, and no deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage off site occurred as a result of this release.\n\nThe release occurred due to a lightning strike that caused power to be lost in one of the manufacturing areas on our site. Because of the uncertain movement of the release due to the shifting winds, the local alert system was sounded as a precautionary measure.  Since previous communications with our community requested that individuals shelter-in-place upon hearing the alert system, it is assumed this action was taken by some within the area, but there are no documented cases.\n\n Investigation into the incident occurred and recommendations to prevent recurrence were documented.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n The Emergency Response program in place at Washington Works is such that plant personnel are trained and equipped to respond to accidental chemical releases.  The program can be summarized as follows:\n\n-Training and preparation\n  -Plant personnel and emergency responders receive emergency response training.\n  -Emergency response plans are current.\n  -The plant conducts periodic emergency drills, including critiques.\n  -A plant representative actively participates on the Washington and Wood Counties Local\n    Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs).\n\n-If a release with the potential for off-site impact occurs:\n -The plant emergency alarm is sounded.\n -The pl"

All of these are monitored to ensure they remain current.  \n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n Making our processes safer is an on-going program at Washington Works.  Employee suggestions, capital improvements, audit programs, and various other activities ensure that we provide safe, reliable processes. Other programs aimed at improving process safety and our emergency response planning include:\n\n-Recommendations defined during cyclic process hazards analyses that reduce or eliminate the\n risks associated with our processes.\n -Training of technical personnel in Inherently Safer Process Technology.\n -Improved exchange of information and communication with our LEPCs."
