The facility handles liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, also known as propane) and liquefied natural gas (LNG, also known as methane.)  It is the policy of the company to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. Only trained personnel work with regulated materials. These personnel are trained to follow safe handling procedures at all times. Regular maintenance and auditing of the system occurs in order to prevent problems.\r\nOther regulations that cover the materials handled include, but are not limited to, OSHA PSM and hazardous material storage regulations.  Those regulations also include accidental release prevention and emergency response provisions.  As discussed below, the facility will respond to minor incidents onsite, but will rely on outside responders in the case of any offsite release situations.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nAtlas Copco Mafi-Trench Company LLC manufactures, assembles, and tests submerged cryogenic pumps.  Tests are conducted in an area known as the test stand, using the LPG or LNG as well as nitrogen.  The cryogenic test stand is the main area of the facility addressed in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and supporting documentation.\r\nAccess to the property is controlled restricted to authorized employees, management, and authorized contractors.\r\nThe LPG and LNG are held in quantities that meet the criteria for mandatory RMP preparation.  LPG is stored in one tank holding approximately 31,000 pounds.  LNG is stored in two tanks of approximately 41,000 lb each.\r\n\r\n3.\t General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\nAll prevention program elements apply to both LNG and LPG.  The company complies with the most stringent prevention program level unde"

      "SummaryText": "r RMP, which is Program Level 3. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with general safety standards, such as NFPA, Compressed Gas Association safe handling practices, Uniform Fire Code and other generally accepted practices.  The system is designed with safety backups throughout, such as backup valves in case one fails.  Many other safety regulations have also been implemented, including OSHA PSM and hazardous material inventory and emergency business plan reporting.\r\nFire prevention is accomplished by controlling access and postings for no smoking.  In addition, the facility has hot work procedures, a water sprinkler deluge system, and UV detection all designed to prevent fires from affecting the storage tanks.  There are also hydrocarbon detectors in the test area to detect releases of LNG or LPG around the tanks, the test stand and the flare.\r\n \r\n4.\t Five Year Accident History\r\nThere has been one incident to report. On May 31, 2012 during start up of routine pump testing a static electric charge ignited gas vapors escaping from the thermal cycle cooling process of the headplate. The source of the fire is believed to be a static electrical spark igniting the escaping gas vapors causing insulation material on the test vessel to catch fire. The ultra-violet sensors activated the deluge system which extinguished the fire. Local fire authortities responded immediately and filled the pit that surrounded the test vessel with water as a precautionary messure. Due to concerns about structual damage the entire test loop underwent pressure testing to assure that the ingrity of the system had not been compromised. Also, the entire ground-bonding system was overhauled as a result of this incident. Testing resumed on July 1, 2012 without any further incidents.\r\n \r\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\r\nAtlas Copco Mafi-Trench Company LLC has documented Emergency Response procedures compliant with OSHA PSM and locally implemented hazardous material storage regulati"

      "SummaryText": "ons. The facility can and will respond to minor incidents within the capabilities of trained maintenance and operations staff, such as isolating and bypassing  a valve with a pin-hole leak.  However, the facility will notify and rely on outside public responders in the event of an off-site release, or any incident that has the potential to cause an off-site release. Public responders will be relied on to inform the public, provide emergency health care, and manage on and offsite mitigation.\r\nThe site staff is trained on emergency notification of public agencies.  The Costa Mesa Fire Department is aware of the hazardous materials onsite and has conducted joint onsite training and regular inspections.  There is a security guard on duty 24 hours a day to oversee the facility and notify authorities in case of an after-hours emergency.\r\n\r\n6.\t Planned changes to improve safety\r\nThe facility has been operating for over 30 years.  Under both OSHA and EPA rules the LNG and LPG systems are regularly audited.  Programs are reviewed and updated routinely, and physical changes are made if recommended by technical experts\r\nIn 2013 we began the process of installing a new vertical storage tank for LNG. This tank will reduce the the amount of LNG that are stored on-site with approximately 8,000 lbs. \r\nIt must be noted in this summary that all operation and test activites are scheduled to cease, at this facility, by August of 2014. The company is relocating to Santa Maria in California."
