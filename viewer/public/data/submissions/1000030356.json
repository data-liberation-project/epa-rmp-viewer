If an accidental release were to occur involving the ammonia storage system, Nachurs would immediately notify the Red Oak Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  Nachurs has an Emergency Action Plan which would be followed.  The Plan provides for sheltering in place or evacuation as directed by the scene commander.  Employees are equipped with radios to maintain communications.\r\n\r\n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe Nachurs facility produces plant food for commercial and private use. The plant food product is produced by mixing several chemicals in a reactor, including ammonia. The ammonia storage process consists of above ground storage tanks and associated piping, valves, pumps and other miscellaneous equipment.\r\n\r\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe Nachurs facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable state law using materials approved for use with aqua ammonia.  As an administrative control, tanks are only filled to 90% of capacity.  The ammonia storage tanks are located within dike walls.  The floor of the dike drains to a spill containment area.  The aqua system is visually inspected daily, it is fully inspected annually by the Maintenance Department and it is inspected every five years by an engineer.  The thicknesses of the tanks are measured every five years by an engineer.  Unloading of ammonia is performed on unloading pads with a 6\" berm surrounding the pad.  T"

Nachurs conducts emergency drills periodically.\r\n\r\n4. Five-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThe Nachurs facility has never had an accident involving its ammonia storage system resulting deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\r\n\r\n5. The emergency response program:\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving ammonia storage system, it is Nachurs' policy to immediately notify the Red Oak Fire Department who would respond to the emergency. The Red Oak Fire Department is aware of this policy.\r\n\r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: \r\n\r\nNachurs feels that its system and procedures are appropriate for handling and storing aqua ammonia, and there are no improvements to safety needed at the current time."
