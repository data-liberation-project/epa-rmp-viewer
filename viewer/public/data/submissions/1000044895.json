The visual alarms are located above the doors to the chlorine storage and regulator rooms and the audio alarms are located are located in three locations: above the doors to the chlorine storage and regulator rooms, near the break room, and in the gallery level of the plant. Chlorine is the only chemical onsite that requires reporting under SARA Title III.  The use and storage of Chlorine at the Plant is regulated by the EPA through a Risk Management Plan.  The plant operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. A shift operator is on duty on each shift and he has, as part of his duties, responsibility to monitor all of the chlorine and its related equipment.\r\n\r\nB.

An offsite consequence analysis was completed using RMP*Comp on Jan 24, 2014 and included consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative scenario. The worst case release scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.  The following summarizes the results of the analysis:\r\nThe worst case release scenario at the Johnstown WWTP involves a failure of a one ton container connected to the manifold that feeds the chlorine regulator. The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for the following conditions: the release of the entire amount (2,000 pounds) as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one"

EPA mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 3.4 mph, standard daily maximum temperature (77 degrees F) were used for the analysis. When atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 3,500 was obtained. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of a flexible connection to a one ton container, possibly due to physical contact by an employee. The release is estimated to be 285 pounds over one half-hour at an average rate of 9.5 pounds per minute. Toxic endpoint distances to the ERPG-2 level was obtained. The typical meteorological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed 6.7 mph and 77degrees F.  The estimated distance traveled to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles. Actuation of the chlorine alarm is an active mitigation measure considered. An additional mitigation system is the use of vacuum withdrawal from the ton containers. This will reduce significantly the amount of chlorine released in a pigtail rupture. \r\n\r\nE. Chemical process related safety equipment maintained at the Plant includes two (2) supplied air breathing apparatus (SABA), chlorine gas detection equipment, and a Chlorine B leak kit for one ton cylinders.  A B Kit Training Device is also provided at the Plant for regular employee training. Further, each Monday each shift has a safety meeting to discuss the possible hazards in the workplace. The result of these meetings is a report that is forwarded to the chief operator that outlines any safety concerns of the employees. This report can contain information specific to any deficiencies in the chlorination supply and equipment as well as other areas of the plant.\r\n\r\nF. Chlorine"

      "SummaryText": "Standard Operational Procedures have been updated at the plant to include the mandatory use of SABA while changing out chlorine containers. A new SABA system has been purchased and put in service. Affected employees have had pulmonary function testing, fit testing, and have been trained in the use of SABA along with the new chlorine SOP. Other SOPs include procedures for One-Ton Chlorine Container Change, Semi Annual Chloralert Maintenance, Weekly Chloralert Maintenance, Weekly Chlorine Pipe Maintenance, Procedures for Chlorine Crain inspection, Pigtail Replacement, Annual Chlorine Regulator Maintenance, Weekly Supplied Airline Breathing Apparatus Inspection, On-Site Chlorine Leak Emergency Response Procedures and Clarifier Project Chlorine Leak Escape Plan.  These SOPs are annually reviewed and revised as necessary.  Copies of these procedures are maintained at the plant and are available to all Plant employees.  The Chief Plant Operator regularly observes plant employees as the follow these procedures to verify they are properly being followed.  The Chief Plant Operator provides individual instruction and review with employees as needed.  A safety observation plan, both peer to peer and management observations, has been instituted at the plant.\r\n\r\nG. A Hazardous Materials Response Plan is prepared for the Plant.  The Plan describes emergency response actions to be taken on-site by Plant personnel in the evident of a Chlorine release as well as by County, local and other emergency management personnel responding to a hazard emergency at the Plant.

      "SummaryText": "f Pennsylvania.  The chemical of concern is Chlorine.  The Plan identifies responsibilities and procedures for community preparedness and response to a hazardous material (hazmat) incident at the Plant. The Plan also emphas procedures on how to limit the potential for releases and how to notify document and report accidents and address releases from the Plant.  The Plan was last revised in November 2013.  The Plant has not experienced a hazardous incident that would have triggered implementation of the Plan. The Plant's Chief Operator, who also serves as the Plant's Emergency Coordinator, coordinates with the Cambria County Department of Emergency Services to annually review and revise the Plan.\r\n\r\nH. Plant employees also adhere to a Hazardous Communication (MSDS) Program and have been trained in the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. The purpose of this Program is to provide a method for employees to learn about chemicals in their workplace and how to work safely with those materials.  This will be accomplished by compiling a list of hazardous substances in the workplace, maintaining a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for each identified substance, labeling of each identified substance and training employees on the hazards and safe work practices required to handle these substances safely.\r\n\r\nI. The plant has instituted a safety committee made up of representatives from all departments and management. The committee discuss safety related topics and projects tracking all concerns, recommendations, and action through to completion. The regional safety manager is directly involved as a resource for the safety committee.\r\n\r\nJ. The Plant's five (5) year accident release history has been updated.  One minor leak, due to a faulty washer, resulting in a minimal release of chlorine occurred at the facility in the past five years."

      "SummaryText": "The Johnstown Redevelopment Authority owns the Johnstown Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and has the ultimate responsibility for its successful operation.  Due to the Redevelopment Authority contracting with Severn Trent  Services for operations, the Johnstown WWTP is subject to the requirements of Subpart C of 40 C.F.R Part 68, relating to Program 3 facilities.  The Plant's Risk Management Plan (RMP)and Process Safety Management Plan(PSM) involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program and OSHA program are adhered to. Jeffrey Mulligan, is the Project Manager and is the Plant's RMP Emergency Contact and the person who has the overall responsibility for implementing the RMP for the Johnstown Waste Water Treatment Plant.  The Plant's Risk Management Plan is based upon the following elements:\r\n\r\n1. Operator/Employee training\r\n2. Preventive maintenance program\r\n3. Safety equipment usage\r\n4. Use of accurate and effective operating procedures\r\n5. Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\r\n6. Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\r\n\r\nA. The Johnstown WWTP is a pure oxygen activated sludge sewage treatment plant that serves the city and all or part of seventeen surrounding municipalities. The type of waste treated is primarily domestic with a limited number of light industrial contributors. The final step of secondary treatment at the plant before it is discharged into the Conemaugh River is disinfection of the final effluent by chlorine gas.  The plant utilizes ton containers of chlorine gas for this purpose.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored at the plant at any given time is Fourteen (14) one-ton cylinders.  These cylinders are housed in the Chlorine Storage Room which has the Chlorine Regulator Room adjacent to it.  Both of these rooms have a chlorine gas detection device that sounds audio alarms as well as a visual alarm in the e"
