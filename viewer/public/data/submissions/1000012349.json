This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Crane gas plant is located outside of Crane, Texas and processes wet natural gas to produce a dry natural gas stream, natural gas liquids and a hydrocarbon condensate oil. The plant has several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes. The wet natural gas from local oil and gas wells enters the facility at pressures ranging from 5 psig to 600 psig. The gas is compressed to 600 psig via six natural gas fired compressors. Condensate is produces ad the gas is compressed and cooled via aerial coolers. The gas then flows to an amine system that is used to sweeten, or remove H2S and CO2 from the sour wet natural gas. The sweetened gas then flows on to the Triethylene Glycol Contactor (TEG) contactor for dehydration.\nAfter leaving the TEG contactor the gas flows to a molecular (mol) sieve bed system to accomplish the final dehydration before entering the cryogenic section of the plant.\nThe sweetened, dehydrated gas is compressed via two natural gas fired compressors to 1000 psig. The gas enters the cryogenic section of the plant is cooled by cross exchangers, a propane refrigerant system (<10,000 lbs of propane), and a turboexpander. The result of this process is that natural gas liquids (NGLs) are removed from the gas and a dry natural gas streem is produced. NGLs, condensate and the dry natural gas are delivered to local pipelines.\n\nGENERAL ACCID"

      "SummaryText": "ENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nThe Crane Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard anyalsis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific\nways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe Crane Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific proc"

The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not\ncompromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\nThe Crane Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Crane Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance\nexperience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This "

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the\nprocess is no longer operative. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\nOperating ProceduresThe Crane Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as \n(1) unit startup, \n(2) normal operations, \n(3) temporary operations, \n(4) emergency shutdown, \n(5) normal shutdown, and \n(6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Crane Gas Plant maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit accedences for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTRAINING\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Crane Gas Plant has implement"

New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and\ntasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conduced at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nThe Crane Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors \n(1) perform their work in a safe manner, \n(2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, \n(3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \n(4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, \n(5) understand and follow site safety rules, and \n(6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with \n(1) a process overview, \n(2) information about safety and health hazards, \n(3) emergency response plan requirements, and \n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. \n\nIn addition, the Crane Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review\nprovides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function\nby requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nThe Crane Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: \n(1) conducting training, \n(2) developing written procedures, \n(3) performing inspections and tests, \n(4) correcting identified deficiencies, and \n(5) applying quality assurance measures. \nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on \n(1) an overview of the process, \n(2) safety and health hazards, \n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, \n(4) emergency response plans, and \n(5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed\nwith all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. \n\nIncident investigation reports\nare retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Crane Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and Staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to\nfacility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.
