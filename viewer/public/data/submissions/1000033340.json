The YDP stores and uses chlorine as a necessary part of the water treatment process. Using and storing chlorine can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. YDP personnel take their safety obligations in storing and using chlorine seriously and ensure that operators involved in the use of chlorine are trained and knowledgeable in the chemical hazards associated with their jobs. The following describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, some of the steps the BOR takes to ensure a safely operating plant, and how chemical emergencies are handled. The YDP's Risk Management Plan (RMP) complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe YDP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. Applicable federal procedures and state of Arizona procedures are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \n\nThe BOR recognizes the responsibility to make the environment, community, and employee safety a primary part of daily concerns. The BOR is committed to being a responsible member within the community by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. The BOR is dedicated to developing an environmentally responsible energy resource compatible with community needs.

The YDP is a government-owned, contractor-operated facility and includes a Production Plant and Water Quality Improvement Center (WQIC). At full capacity, the Production Plant can produce over 72 million gallons of product water per day, the largest brackish water reverse osmosis desalting plant in the U.S. However, the Production Plant has not operated since March 2011. The WQIC, which is an advanced water treatment research facility including an approximately 1/100th scale version of the Production Plant called Pilot System 1 (PS-1), is currently operational and provides treated water to the YDP for potable, service, and fire protection uses.\n\nYDP uses chlorine to provide a chlorine solution as a disinfectant, necessary to promote the destruction of algae, bacteria, micro-organisms, and other aquatic life due to chlorine's strong oxidizing power. Gaseous chlorine is supplied to the chlorine system for the WQIC (PS-1) plant chlorination system by direct feed through a vacuum regulator from one-ton containers. The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the YDP is 12,000 pounds. This quantity exceeds the EPA Risk Management Program threshold of 2,500 pounds; therefore, the chlorine process is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program regulations and qualifies for Program 3.\n\n\n\nSummary of the Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, the YDP has had no accidents involving chlorine that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nSummary of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe BOR has developed a written Emergency Response Plan, which establishes emergency response pro"

The Emergency Response Plan details the response procedures, protective measures, levels of training, regulatory notification requirements, and post-incident investigation procedures. The Emergency Response Plan also identifies emergency assembly areas, evacuation routes, and related procedures to be undertaken during emergency scenarios by YDP employees. The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Yuma Rural/Metro Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n \n\nThe YDP's accidental release prevention program is in compliance with federal Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements and is based on the following key elements:\n\n?    A detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\n\n?    Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors\n\n?    A comprehensive preventive maintenance program\n\n?    Performance of process hazard analyses (PHA) with operation and maintenance staff participation and review\n\n?    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\n?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n\n?    A high level of training for the operators and maintenance staff\n\n?    Implementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff\n\n\n\nThe YDP's chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\n\nThe PSM program for the chlorine process is briefly summarized below. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe YDP compiles and maintains up-to-da"

This information is used to identify and understand the hazards in operating the chlorine process. The safety information includes material safety data sheets (MSDS), a process description, maximum intended inventory, safe operating limits, equipment specifications, and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the system. The BOR also has procedures in place that are triggered to update process safety information in the event of a major change that would make existing information inaccurate. Additionally, the chlorine process is equipped with a number of safety features designed to prevent accidental releases. Such safety devices include leak detectors and alarms and emergency shower/eyewash stations.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe initial chlorine PHA was conducted in 2006 using the What-if/Checklist method and evaluated the use of chlorine supplied by 150-pound cylinders, one-ton containers, and 90-ton railcars. A PHA revalidation was conducted in 2009 for changes to the chlorine process that allowed the use of 20-ton tank trailers. The most recent PHA revalidation occurred in 2012 for changes made to the chlorine process following shutdown of the Production Plant. The 2012 PHA revalidation evaluated the use of one-ton chlorine containers in the WQIC (PS-1) process. The PHA will be revalidated again or updated within a five-year period or whenever there is a major change in the process.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe BOR maintains up-to-date and accurate written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for the chlorine process.
