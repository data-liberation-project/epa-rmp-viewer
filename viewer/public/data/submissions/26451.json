This team will be trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  The team wil be capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement  and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment.\n\nAll Hazmat courses at Iowa Ham Canning, Inc., are designed to meet training requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) (7) and (8). All Iowa Ham Canning, Inc. Hazmat Team Members are trained 24 hours initially to the Technician level followed by 8-24 hours of refresher training per year under the direction of the on-site Hazmat Instructor at the facility. Each Instructor receives an initial 40 hours of training and 8-16 hours per year re-certification training that goes to I.C. level. \n\nThe training is designed to teach both theory and hands-on training giving the person an overall understanding of the nature of hazardous materials and the ability to assess and safely respond to the incidents in the Incident Command structure.  Technician level  training includes but is not limited to the following:\n\u00bf Knowledge of basic hazards and risk assessment techniques\n\u00bf Proper selection and use of appropriate and required PPE for the chemicalhazard                                        \n\u00bf Terminology associated with Haz"

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n                                                                                                                                                                            To insure safe operation and release prevention at Iowa Ham Canning, Inc., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Iowa Ham Canning, Inc., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                  \n2.

Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario:\n\n Worst-case scenario---Failure of a +15 dF Recirculator when releasing the total facility ammonia charge, 24,000 pounds of ammonia, in 10 minutes.

      "SummaryText": "ystem is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  The loss of 24,000  pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 2.00 miles before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative release scenario---An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.  The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system is equipped with high pressure cutouts that help to prevent releases of this nature.  Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required. This facility has had (0) releases in the past 5 years. \n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program:\n                                                                                                                                                                      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.
