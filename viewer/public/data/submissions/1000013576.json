This facility has mechanisms in-place as identified in the Process Safety Management Manual on the refrigeration system to address small releases of ammonia. If an emergency release were to occur (i.e. a reportable amount), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they respond to the emergency. The Hanover facility is included in the Caroline County Emergency Operations Plan. Procedures are contained therein for response to an emergency involving the ammonia refrigeration systems by non-facility personnel.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThis facility is a raw vegetable processing facility. The facility receives, processes, packages, and freezes raw vegetables for shipping to other destinations. We use ammonia as a refrigerant in several systems to provide refrigeration capacity to process equipment including coolers, freezers, evaporator units, and water chillers. The systems are identified as Flo Freezer #1, Cold Storage #2 and #3, and Cold Storage #4.  The combined total capacity of the plant is 27,600 pounds of ammonia.\n\nThe worst case and alternative case release scenarios:\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of a pipe or vessel in which the maximum inventory in high pressure receiver (RE-3) of 12,254 pounds is released to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance to a 200 ppm ammonia toxic endpoint is 1.2 miles and public receptors are within the distance to endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a 1/4\" effective diameter orifice leak (representative of a pump seal leak or gasket rupture) leading to an airborne release. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends for 0.1 miles.\n\nThe general accident release preventi"

The ammonia refrigeration systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with IIAR codes and standards.\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nWe have not had an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place in the five years prior to April, 2010.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia refrigeration systems, it is our policy to perform immediate external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Commission) and request that they respond to the emergency. The Hanover facility is included in the Caroline County Emergency Operations Plan. Procedures are contained therein for response to an emergency involving the ammonia refrigeration systems by non-facility personnel.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the refrigeration systems.\n"
