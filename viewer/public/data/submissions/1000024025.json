The warehouse and storage facility located at 30933 Imperial St. Shafter, California, stores various chemicals for resale. Chemicals are\n\npurchased from manufacturers or their representatives, brought to the Argo Chemical facility, unloaded, stored, blended and reloaded for shipment to the customer. The following are key elements of the RMP plan:\n\n\n\n(a) Argo chemical is a retail operation subject to the OSHA Process Standard.  Argo Chemical incorporates all the elements of the Program 3 Prevention program, worst-case scenario analysis, alternative release analysis,\n\n5-year history, document management system, process safety information, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audit, management of change, pre-startup review, employee participation, hot work permits and emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n(b) The stationary sources and the regulated substances handled are:\n\n\n\nAqua ammonia:\n\n  This product, handled in bulk, is stored in four tanks. Three of the tanks have a capacity of 26,815 gal. with a fill capacity of 25,740 gal. One tank has a fill capacity of 43,000 gal. with a fill capacity of 40,850 gal. Each tank is storing 29.5% aqua ammonia. It is loaded into shipping containers using pumps and hoses with a vapor return line to the vessel from which the product is being removed.\n\n\n\nCompressed Anhydrous ammonia:\n\n  Argo chemical handles this product in 4 pressurized tanks. 1-tank with a 15,446 gal capacity, with a maximum fill capacity of 13,130 gal., 2-13,000 gal tanks with fill capacities of 11,050 gal., and 1-tank with a 21,619 gal capacity with a fill capacity of 18,375 gal per management directive. Bulk shipments of Anhydrous ammonia are received by pressurized transport and unloaded directly into the ammonia storage tank battery.

The facility never has more than 90 ammonia cylinders in storage.\n\n\n\nChlorine gas cylinders:\n\n  This product is delivered from the manufacture in closed 150 lb cylinders. A maximum of 30 cylinders may be off-loaded from the delivery truck in cages and strapped into place before being removed from the truck. The cylinders are always stored in these cages and strapped and chained together. Argo then delivers the cylinders to the end user using the same procedure. At no time is the chlorine gas use in any of the processes at Argo Chemical.\n\n\n\n(c) Worst-case scenarios\n\n\n\nAqua ammonia: the release of the entire contents of the tank (285,728 lbs.) in 10 minutes; or alternatively  3,700 lbs. are released in 10 minutes. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia: the release of the entire contents of the tank (94,600 lbs.) in 10 minutes; or alternatively the release of 2,700 lbs. in 15 minutes. \n\n\n\nChlorine: A release of 150 lbs. from a single cylinder in 10 minutes or alternatively the leakage of 150 lbs. in 100 minutes.\n\n\n\n(d) Argo Chemical has in place an accidental release prevention program, which, among others, includes Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Instructions, Compliance Audits and Training. Furthermore the Anhydrous ammonia and Aqua ammonia handling facility has a water deluge system capable of delivering 100 gallons per minute of water in a form of a spray covering the ammonia plant and storage area in its entirety.\n\n\n\n(e) Argo Chemical has an Emergency Response Plan and coordinates its activities with all applicable Governmental Agencies.\n\n\n\n(f) Argo Chemical is committed to safe and responsible distribution of chemical products.
