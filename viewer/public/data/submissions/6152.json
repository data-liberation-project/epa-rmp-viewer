      "SummaryText": "Randaw Farms owned and operated by Randy Bjustrom has an accidental release prevention and emergency plans that states that we comply with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur Randy Bjustrom is to be notified immediately and he will decide what steps to be taken.  This is a corn farming operation.  Our worst case scenario is a failure of our anhydrous ammonia storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  This would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 5.1 miles.  This has an estimated 743 people within the radius.  Residences, commerical business, school, offices and recreation areas are also located in the radius.  Randaw Farms complies with EPA's accident prevention rules, all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is designed, and maintained in accordancewith regulations and state law.  We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Whittemore Fire Dept and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Kossuth County Disaster Coordinator and Whittemore Fire Dept members.  Randy plans on writing up an emergency response plan and providing the same to the Whittemore Fire Dept for their records."
