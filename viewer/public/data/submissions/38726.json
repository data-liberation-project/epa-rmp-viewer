      "SummaryText": "PROCESS SUMMARY\nThe Reddy Ice-LAS VEGAS facility manufactures ice for wholesale/retail distribution and provides public cold storage for the Las Vegas market. The facility utilizes approximately 19,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant for ice manufacturing and public storage refrigeration systems.\n\nThe facility has two refrigeration systems, one each for the ice manufacturing process and for the cold storage system, with standard refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as their refrigerant. Each system has numerous protective controls (motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, and high/ low oil pressure) that will shut down the compressor(s) if operating limits are exceeded.\n\nBoth systems incorporate multiple screw compressors, a high-pressure ammonia storage receiver and low-pressure ammonia vessels, evaporative condensers and a common ammonia blow-down system. In addition, the icemaker system includes seven icemakers and one air-cooling evaporator, while the cold storage system includes nineteen room evaporators, an under floor heating system, and several smaller vessels. Four additional evaporators can be operated from either system as required.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility?s program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capabili"

The cold storage system is operated by a Process Limit Controller (PLC) that allows for computer control of the system from within the plant or remotely via modem. Administrative controls are in place that limit the utilization of vessels to approximately 20 to 30% of their intended capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM 3\nBased on the Reddy Ice-Las Vegas facility?s ammonia inventory, location, and requirement to meet OSHA PSM standards, it has been determined the facility is subject to the Prevention Program 3 requirements. This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice Group corporate management and Reddy Ice-Las Vegas management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA?s Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\n\nMAN"

      "SummaryText": "AGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements. The plant manager has been identified as PSM/RM Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements. Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals. The plant engineer is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. An established safety committee meets each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Las Vegas facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-Las Vegas facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-Las Vegas facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\nAs required, the facility has coordinated "

The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\nThe Reddy Ice-Las Vegas facility operates an ongoing program of facility preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations. On a corporate level, Reddy Ice is continuing to implement ammonia diffusion/neutralization system installation at all plants and supporting the installation of additional ammonia detection, alarm, ventilation, and safety systems at its larger facilities."
