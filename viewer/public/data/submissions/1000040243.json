The following plan is how Mid-West Fertilizer, Inc. - Independence plans to prevent accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n1.The facility policy for accidental release prevention:                                                                    \r\na.This facility handles anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA.

The management of Mid-West Fertilizer, Inc. - Independence is committed to the safe handling and prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared o work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.  \r\n                                                                    \r\n2.Facility Information:                                                                                                                              a.The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for retail sales to area farmers.
