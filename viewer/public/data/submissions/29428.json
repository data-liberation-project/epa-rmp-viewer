We have three storage caverns that are used to store propane. Wells one and two have a capacity of 407,000 Bbls. and well three has a capacity of 34,000 Bbls. We have four truck loading racks. We no not have any above ground storage. Propane comes in via Williams Mid Amercia Pipeline and is shipped out by transport to Mexico. We do not resale or wholesale any product.\n\nThis facility complies with NFPA-58, Texas Railroad Commission, state and local requirements for LP-Gas. In the event of an emergency it is our policy to notify the Andrews County Sheriffs Office and the Texas Railroad Commission and requestthat they respond.\n\nA worst case scenario would be the failure of a transport trailer when filled to capacity, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Since we are located in a remote area, the worst case scanario would not likely affect any one beyond our facility.\n\nWe have fail-safe valves on each wellhead, (both product and brine sides) and on the load racks. In addition there are two fail-safe valves in the piping between the wells and load racks. In the event of an emergency these valves would automatically close in. All piping, except for metering and transfer areas is under ground. All avtivities are monitored by plant personal at all times.\n\nWE have never had an accident involving propane that caused death, injuries, or any kind of damage.\n\nThis facility has it's own Emergency Response Program. A copy is given to each employee and a copy is posted in the office. The Andrews County Sheriffs Office and the Texas Railroad Commission have copies.\nOur emergency shutdown system consists of manual switches, gas and flame detectors. There are four manual switches. One at the loading area, one in the office and two in the plant yard.We have gas and flame detectors at each wellhead and around the"
