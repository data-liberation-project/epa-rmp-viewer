The Dover plant produces key ingredients in a wide variety of applications such as lubricants and greases, candles, plastics, tires, soaps, cosmetic bath oils, shaving creams, skin creams, printing inks, and adhesives.   Arizona Chemical supplies materials to companies such as Chevron, Noxell, 3M, Avon, Goodyear, DuPont, IBM, Texaco, Exxon, Kingsford, and Monsanto.\n\nArizona Chemical has two chemicals that meet the 112(r) rule toxic chemicals threshold quantities (TQs); the chemicals are anhydrous ammonia (NH3) and ethylenediamine (EDA).  The TQ for NH3 is 10,000 lbs, while the TQ for EDA is 20,000 lbs.  The NH3 is used in the solvent-separation plant portion of the facility as a refrigerant in the process.  The EDA is used in the polyamide process portion of the facility as a reactant in the process.\n\nArizona Chemical is committed to handling all extremely hazardous substances safely to prevent their \naccidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such release. \n\nManagement System\n\n     Arizona Chemical has established a management system to oversee the implementation of its Risk \n     Management Program responsibilities.  The management system is designed to help ensure that each \n     element of the program is fully and effectively completed.  A qualified professional engineer has been \n     assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the program \n     elements.
