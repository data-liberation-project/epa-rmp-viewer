      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe PPG Refinish - Lima Distribution Center (DC) complies with applicable Ohio, and US EPA regulations and applicable Department of Transportation requirements.\nPPG's EHS Policy incorporates the elements of several voluntary global industry initiatives, including Responsible Care; and Coatings Care, which help companies manage safe and environmentally responsible practices in the chemicals and coatings industries.  Employees at the Lima DC are trained in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling practices, and fork truck driving safety.  Central to PPG's focus on safety and the environment is its EHS Policy. The policy provides the guidelines under which PPG markets, distributes and manufactures products globally in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment. \nII. Regulated Substances Handled\nPPG Refinish - Lima Distribution Center  is owned and operated by PPG Industries, Inc (PPG) and stores automotive refinish paints, primers, and associated products. These products are distributed to both internal refinish distribution centers and external distributors throughout North America and worldwide. Products are stored in various containers including aerosol spray cans. These aerosol spray cans contain propane, butane, isobutane, and methyl ether, which are used as propellants.  These four materials are regulated flammable substances under the EPA RMP regulation.  The aerosol products are stored in a separate storage area designed for this purpose.\nIII. Worst-Case Scenario:\nWorst-case analysis consisted of a 1-lb release resulting in a vapor cloud of 0.01 miles (0.013km / 52.8ft). The flammable aerosols are stored within the facility in a designated storage area; therefore the vapor cloud would be contained within the facility walls.\nIV.
