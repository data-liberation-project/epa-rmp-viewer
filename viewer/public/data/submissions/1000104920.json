Therefore, Energy Transfer Gulf Coast Operations has developed a General Duty Form to assure compliance with the general duty clause of the CAA as referenced in the ARP/RMP regulation.\n\nGENERAL DUTY\nPrevention of Accidental Release\nBackground\nThe Chemical Accidental Release Prevention Provisions are contained in 40 CFR Part 68. The regulation establishes requirements for a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a listed flammable or toxic substance in a process or storage. Sources having less than the threshold quantity of a listed substance, or any quantity of a non-listed, extremely hazardous substance, are subject to the general duty requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The June 20, 1996, edition of the Federal Register states the following on page 31670.\n\u0093...The general duty clause provides that owners and operators have a general duty to identify hazards that may result from accidental releases, design and maintain a safe facility, and minimize the consequences of any releases that occur. The general duty clause is a self-executing statutory requirement: it requires no regulations or other EPA action to take effect. The clause provides a separate statutory mechanism that EPA will use in appropriate circumstances to ensure the protection of public health and the environment.\u0094\nClean Air Act Amendments of 1990\n112 (r) (1)\tPrevention of Accidental Releases-\nPurpose and General Duty \u0096 \u0093It shall be the objective of the regulations and programs authorized under this subsection to prevent the accidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such release of any substance listed pursuant to paragraph (3) \u0096 (listed chemicals) \u0096 or any other extremely hazardous substance.

In addition, owners and operators are required to design and maintain a safe facility and minimize the consequences of any releases of these substances that occur.

A 5-year renewal also gives Energy Transfer L.P. personnel the opportunity to verify that each covered process still meets the eligibility criteria for its program level. Based on information regarding the type and quantity of stored/handled chemicals currently onsite, it was verified that the Stationary Source process areas are Program 3 processes under the ARP Program (40 CFR 68).\n\nREVIEW OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Stationary Source \u0093is\u0094 designated as a \u0093first responder\u0094 in case of an accidental release of a regulated substance. The facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidently released. If facility employees take part in responding to accidental releases, then the Stationary Source is required to periodically review and update, as appropriate, the facility\u0092s emergency response program and notify employees of any changes to the emergency response plan (40 CFR 68.95). Updates should include the date of the most recent review of th"

All equipment and vessels are connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of multiple processes. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\nThere are no regulated toxic substances at this Stationary Source more than RMP threshold quantities.\nThis Stationary Source does store regulated flammable substances in vessels that exceed threshold quantity; therefore, the Stationary Source is a covered process with regulated substances subject to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis (see Table 1 located on following page). A brief description of the regulated flammable substances identified and evaluated at the Stationary Source is presented as follows.\n\nREGULATED FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCES\nThe RMP regulated substances handled at the Stationary Source are propane, Iso butane and Ethyl Mercaptan. \nThe maximum amounts of flammable materials are listed below.\nPropane (C3)\t                                149,835 pounds reported on RMP as 149,900 pounds\nIsobutane (CH3)3\t                        170,275 pounds reported on RMP as 170,280 pounds\nEthyl Mercaptan (CH3 CH2 SH)\t15,721 pounds reported on RMP as 15,730 pounds\nPropane (C3) (loaded railcar)\t143,841 pounds reported on RMP as 143,850 pounds\nIsobutane (C4) (loaded railcar)\t163,464 pounds reported on RMP as 163,470 pounds\nButane (C4) [V-100]\t                  31,718.6 pounds reported on RMP as 31,720 pounds\nButane (C4) [V-200]\t                  31,718.6 pounds reported on RMP as 31,720 pounds\nButane (C4) [V-300]\t                  31,718.6 pounds reported on RMP as 31,720 pounds\nEthylene (C2H4)\t                          13,720 pounds reported on RMP as 14,000 pounds\nEthylene (C2H4)\t                          1"

The threshold quantity for regulated toxic substances listed on Table 1 of the regulation varies according to each substance and ranges from 500 \u0096 20,000 pounds.\nEach covered process regulated under the ARP Program is assigned as either a Program 1, 2, or 3 status and must meet the applicable criteria of the assigned program. Program 1 processes are those that meet the following criteria:\n\u00b7\tthe process has not had an accidental release in the past five years that resulted in an offsite consequence (i.e., injuries, deaths, or environmental damage);\n\u00b7\tthe distance to an endpoint is less than the distance to any public receptor; and\n\u00b7\tEmergency response has been coordinated with local emergency response organizations.\nProgram 3 processes meet the following criteria:\n\u00b7\tthe distance to an endpoint exceeds the distance to any public receptor; or\n\u00b7\tthe process has had an accidental release in the past five years resulting in an offsite consequence; and either\n\u00b7\tFalls into one of ten NAICS codes [32211, 31411, 32511, 325181, 325188, 325192, 325199, 325211, 325311, and 32532]; or subject to the OSHA process safety management standard [40 CFR 68.10 (d) (2)].\nProgram 2 processes are those that do not meet Program 1 or 3 criteria.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ARP PROGRAM STATUS DETERMINATION\nThe Stationary Source covered process is located at latitude 29\u00b051'19.97 N and longitude 94\u00b054'19.13 W. This is situated near the township of Mont Belvieu, in Chambers County, Texas.  \n\nThe facility maintains quantities of propane, butane, ethylene, and ethyl mercaptan above RMP threshold quantities.

The requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A \u0096 H. Under the ARP Program, a facility that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process must comply with the requirements of the ARP provisions.\nThe \u0093List Rule\u0094 (under 40 CFR 68, Subpart C, and Tables 1 through 4 of 68.130) identifies regulated substance threshold quantities for determining ARP Program applicability. Threshold quantities have been established for flammable and toxic substances. The threshold quantity for all regulated flammables (Table 3 of the regulation) is 10,000 pounds. The threshold determination for mixtures of flammable substances is in accordance with 40 CFR 68.115(b) (2). In cases where the listed substance is greater than one percent by weight of the mixture (for a flammable), the entire weight of the mixture is considered in the threshold determination, unless it can be demonstrated that the mixture itself does not hav"
