Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n      At the Syngas Separation Unit facility, gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide are produced.  Flammable gases containing hydrogen, methane, and ethane are present in the process in concentrations and amounts that cause the process to be covered by the EPA RMP regulation.  Other chemicals are produced in processes that are not covered by the RMP regulation.\n\nIt is company policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes through the use of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g.\nalarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of the facility and with other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of plant personnel act as a \n      supplement to the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire department and State Police Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.  The facility communicates regularly and works closely with the LEPC (emergency planning committee), the Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and \n      Emergency Preparedness (OEP), and other community responders.  \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the update of this RMP and in the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2. The stationary so"

      "SummaryText": "urce and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of the covered process located at this facility is the production  and purification of gaseous hydrogen and gaseous carbon monoxide.  These gases are used by customers to manufacture other chemicals.\n\nA gaseous mixture is received by the plant via pipeline.  This gas contains hydrogen and carbon monoxide, but the hydrogen and carbon monoxide are mixed with methane, ethane, and other impurities.  The gas is subjected to a series of steps to remove some of the impurities.  The hydrogen and carbon monoxide are then separated from each other and from the remaining impurities in a cold box, which purifies the products by cryogenic distillation.  The product gases are compressed and delivered to customers via the pipeline network.  A portion of the product gases are also shipped in over-the-road vehicles.\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Syngas Separation Unit facility developed prevention program elements based on the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.  Five year accident history:\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents within the past five years that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site nor have there been any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER standard.  At the site employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA's First\nResponder - Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training concerning their role in the emergency plan.  An alarm system is used for notification of fires or spills"

In the event of an emergency, Air Products is a member of the \nGeismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) organization and cooperates with local industrial neighbors and emergency response agencies to provide assistance when needed.  The facility communicates regularly and works closely with the LEPC (local emergency planning committee), the Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (OEP), and other community responders.  Detailed emergency response plans incorporating OEP, local police and fire departments and GAMA are in place at the facility.  The OEP maintains a manned, 24-hour, 911 emergency center, and the parish emergency siren systems.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nChanges to improve safety will be based on revalidated hazard reviews and incident investigations which provide recommendations that may result in modifications to the plant design and/or operating  procedures in order to assure safe operation of the facility."
