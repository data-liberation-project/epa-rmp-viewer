(NSGNA) is subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules at 40 CFR 68 due to the amounts of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, or HF, (which is a toxic gas) that will be present in a single process at any one time above the applicable threshold of 1,000 lbs.  The on-site process has the potential to contain a maximum total of 3,000 lbs. of anhydrous HF.  \n\n\n\nThe HF will be stored in two pressure barrels which will be limited to no more than 1500 lbs of anhydrous HF each.  Each barrel is stored in its own containment cabinet within a containment building separate from the main plant.  Each barrel is independently connected to the process. \n\n\n\nThe barrels are filled at the supplier location and barrel integrity checks are performed at the supplier location before being shipped to the NSGNA site.  We have confirmed with the supplier that HF barrels complete a hydrostatic test every five years.  The HF is received from the supplier in the barrels as a fuming liquid pressurized under its own vapor pressure.  Each HF barrel valving is protected by a \"bonnet\" which covers the valves until removed when the barrel is placed in the cabinet for use.\n\n\n\nThe HF is metered into the plant through a control cabinet.  The system is monitored for pressure reduction that could indicate a leak.  In the event of a leak the system will automatically shutdown and is purged using nitrogen.  In the event there is HF released inside the building or inside the cabinet at a concentration of 3 ppm the system will automatically shut down and HF gas is diverted to the Coatings Pollution Control Plant.  There are HF Detectors that alarm at 1.5 ppm and shuts down the system at an HF concentration of 3 ppm.\n\n",

The facility, which produces coated glass used by the solar industry (NAICS 327211), sits on approximately 103 acres and will operate 24 hours a day for 365 days a year.  The facility will begin the process of operating in November 2020 and will produce finished product by December 2020.  NSG will employ 147 people from the surrounding areas once operational.\n\n\n\nNSG Glass North America, Inc. is subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules at 40 CFR 68 due to the amounts of anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, or HF, (a toxic gas) that will be present in a single process at any one time above the applicable threshold of 1000 lbs.  The on-site process has the potential to contain a maximum total of 3,000 lbs of anhydrous HF. In addition, the facility must meet Process Safety Management requirements established by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.119 as well as Emergency Planning regulations required by OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120) and EPA mandated regulations (40 CFR 112, 264, 265, 279.52, and 112).\n\n\n\nThe Luckey site does not have an on-site accident history, but the site will be subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards due to the presence of HF in amounts over the PSM thresholds in a single process.  In addition, the plant does have public receptors within the worst case scenario release area.  Because of this the Luckey site will be managed under RMP Program Level 3.\n\n\n\nThe company has a corporate health and safety policy that is the foundation for the safety process.  Chemicals within the company is managed through the Hazard Communication Standard as well as the Management of Change process when new chemicals are brought on site.  The plant works to only bring chemicals on site if needed.  Our goal is to minimize the amount of chemicals on site based on the needs of our operatio"

In addition, each cabinet has a HF Detector monitoring for HF levels and the control panel used to regulate HF into the plant is also equipped with a detector.  These detectors alarm at 1.5 ppm and at 3 ppm the HF System is shutdown so that delivery to the coatings process is stopped.  In the event the HF System is operating, at 3 ppm in either barrel storage cabinet or metering cabinet, the system is shutdown and any HF released inside these areas are directed to the Coatings Pollution Control Plant (PCP).\n\n\n\nHF piping leading to the coatings area is double contained so that in the event of a leak along this piping, It will be contained.  In the event of a leak, the system is shutdown due to pressure changes a leak would cause.  If a leak is detected the HF System will shutdown and the cabinet doors cannot be opened until a purge is done of the system that would evacuate any HF in the system.  \n\n\n\nThe Luckey Plant does have an Emergency Response Plan due to having chemicals on site above the threshold planning levels under 40 CFR 302.4 or 40 CFR 355.  We do have personnel trained as Incident Commanders in the event of an emergency where a release or spill goes off site.  The facility has a third party Emergency Response Contractor that is called in in the event of an incident.  "
