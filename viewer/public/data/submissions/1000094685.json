      "SummaryText": "VRU Executive Summary\r\nEnergy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LP Cedar Bayou Tank Farm Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU)\r\n\r\nBased on the regulated chemical quantities on site, predicted offsite impacts, and the five-year accident history, Cedar Bayou Tank Farm VRU is a RMP Program level 1 process. \r\n\r\nIntroduction and Background\r\nThe Cedar Bayou Tank Farm VRU is a process supporting the Energy Transfer Cedar Bayou tank farm. This facility is in rural Harris County near Crosby, Texas. The Cedar Bayou tank farm consists of several liquid state hydrocarbon storage tanks classified as DOT break out tanks.  The product being storage incident to transportation. As such, the tanks themselves fall under 49 CFR part 195 regulations and are exempt from PSM/RMP. The VRU is a support process that was subsequently added to the tanks in order to control and meet growing air emission requirements associated with tank operations. While the tanks are exempt from RMP the VRU process is covered by RMP.  It must therefore meet requirements of the RMP rule. Two of the DOT regulated tanks (TK 5010 and TK 5050) are dedicated solely to natural gasoline service.  Emissions from these two tanks is fed to VRU for the purpose of recovering waste hydrocarbon from tank vapor phase pad gas. This vapor space pad gas is a mixture of externally supplied N2 and flashed natural gasoline vapors coming from the contents of the tank. The boiling point of natural gasoline stored in these tanks' ranges between 95 - 147oF. Data shows that the pad gas temperature in TK 5010 and 5050 is not expected to exceed 90o F.  This max temperature is without benefit of refrigeration.  Pad gas becomes waste gas when fluid is being injected during a tank refilled and vapor space is being reduced. The VRU unit allows the hydrocarbon in the ejected pad gas to be recovered, preventing it from being vented to atmosphere. This promotes safety and helps the environment.  Recovery is achieved by having the waste gas first pass through a b"

      "SummaryText": "release is defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. This operation does not store or handle any toxic chemicals.  The only RMP regulated chemical is the flammable mixture of natural gasoline. The greatest volume of natural gasoline at the VRU will be contained in TK 7300. The WCS flammable mixture scenario required by RMP seeks the end point of a 1.0 psi overpressure (i.e. 15. 7 psia) resulting from a release of flammable substance and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion. The quantity in the vapor cloud is assumed to equal the storage capacity of TK 7300, i.e. the total release of the listed flammable mixture in TK 7300. The HCC flammable mixture is assumed to vaporize instantaneously and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Factors in selecting the WCS included consideration other potential sources however, no other scenario would result in a greater distance to an endpoint than TK 7300.  Using guidance from Appendix C, butane was used as the predominant regulated flammable in the TK7300 flammable mixture.  A resultant 0.3-mile endpoint distance was found using EPA's RMP*Comp program. (Available online at the EPS web site.) Offsite impacts were determined using the Marplot program with a 0.3-mile radius of exposure, a center point of the radius being TK 7300. There are zero public or environmental receptors found within the 0.3-mile radius of TK 7300.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nThere have been zero applicable accidents within the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Coordination\r\nEnergy Transfer's Cedar Bayou Tank Farm VRU operations maintains active coordination with local emergency response organizations including, Harris County LEPC, Baytown and Crosby Fire Dept., and Local Police jurisdictions. This coordination includes periodic joint response drills and emergency responder awareness notification."

      "SummaryText": "lower to boost pressure, it then enters the skid mounted John Zink Carbon Adsorption-Absorption Hydrocarbon VRU. The gas is passed through a carbon bed, where the gaseous natural gasoline hydrocarbon is captured in a carbon adsorption bed. N2 does not adhere to the carbon and passes through this adsorption bed to be harmlessly vented to atmosphere.  Hydrocarbons stuck in the adsorption bed are removed from the bed by pulling a vacuum on the bed.  Released natural gasoline vapors are then sent to an absorption bed where the vapors come in contact with a liquid solvent stream of chilled natural gasoline from TK 7300.  At this point, vapors in the absorption bed liquefy and mix with the natural gasoline solvent. The enriched mixture is then returned to TK 7300 to be either be sent delivered to the product pipeline for transportation or used for another cycle of absorption. \r\n\r\nRegulated Chemical Quantities on Site:\r\nThe only vessel or pipe in the VRU process having a substantial quantity of flammable mixture (and is therefore of greatest interest) is TK 7300.  Contents of TK 7300 is natural gasoline (a flammable hydrocarbon mixture). The rated volumetric capacity of TK 7300 is 13,000 gallons with a maximum intended operational fluid level maintained at 6175 gallons or less. Design and operational safeguards are in place to ensure the maximum intended inventory level of the fluid in TK 7300 does not exceed 6175 gallons. TK7300 natural gasoline has a typical weight of 5.44 lbs per gallon.  6175 gallons at 5.44 lbs/gallon yields a maximum intended weight of approx. 33,600 lbs. Analysis shows a typical chemical speciation and contents of the natural gasoline mixture found in TK7300 at maximum intended quantity of: \r\n  Ethane          1 lb\r\n  Propane         3 lb\r\n  Iso-Butane     20 lb\r\n  n-Butane      896 lb\r\n  Iso-Pentane 9,892 lb\r\n  n-Pentane   9,484 lb\r\n  Hexane+    13,289 lb\r\n\r\nPredicted Offsite Impacts:\r\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) required for a Program 1 Process"
