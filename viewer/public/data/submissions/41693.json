This request was made pursuant to California Health & Safety Code (H&SC) Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Section 25534(b)(1) and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CaIARP).\n\nAt the time of implementation, only one ton container of chlorine was kept on site at any given time, which kept us under the 2,500 lb threshold quantity as noted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies Consolidated List of Chemicals Subject to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. We now operate with a total of two chlorine ton containers on site at all times. One container is used for chlorination with the second container in standby until the first container runs dry causing the regulator valve to switch over to the standby container. The empty ton container is then replaced with a full container. This new arrangement of having a second container onsite, reduces problems associated with shipping schedules and allows us to completely empty a container before having to change it out.\n\nThe CaIARP Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of California threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and a"

This Risk Management Plan (RMP) was filed as required by CalARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe City of Yreka's Fall Creek Pumping Station is located at 19117 Copco Rd, Hornbrook, CA in Siskiyou County, and uses chlorine for disinfection in quantities greater than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) threshold quantity for this RS. The facility is located on the north bank of the Klamath River near Copco Reservoir, in a rural hilly area with few residences. There are no full-time employees at this site. Operators visit the site on a regular basis and also respond to alarm conditions. The chlorine ton container is delivered to the site by a trucking company, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on a dual container scale inside the building. The chlorine is used to disinfect potable water. Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve. From there, the chlorine under vacuum is metered through a rotameter in a chlorinator located in a separate room, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Yreka that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment. In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Yreka has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; perf"

The worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in CalARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest single container of RS (in this case chlorine) over a period of 10 minutes. The scenario considered the release of the contents of the largest container of chlorine on site, in this case 2,000 Ib. This release scenario is not physically possible, due to the characteristics of chlorine.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAn alternative case release scenario is required to be considered for each toxic RS handled in quantities greater than the threshold quantity at the site. The alternative case scenario is described in CalARP regulations as a likely release resulting in offsite effects, considering administrative controls and mitigation measures in place, and is to be determined by the facility operators as part of the Process Hazard Analysis required to be performed during RMP development. The alternative case considered for this facility is the release of chlorine from a failed relief vent, with the release secured by emergency responders by closing the gas valve after 2 hours.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at the City of Yreka which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include the City of Yreka's written policies and procedures for training of operators and"

No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario. Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of the timely response of properly trained and equipped emergency responders.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by City of Yreka are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs. The City of Yreka has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its disinfection process. This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for the City of Yreka's operations.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented. These include, among other things, creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCity of Yreka's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Siskiyou County Public Health Department, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination. It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies and evacuation of persons on site to designated assembly areas up"
