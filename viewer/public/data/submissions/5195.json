Of those chemicals only one qualifies for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP), ammonium hydroxide.\n\nSlack Chemical is located at the base of the foot hills of the  Adirondak Mountains and approximately 30 miles east of Lake Ontario. The facility is located in Carthage, New York. Carthage is an urban area. Slack Chemical is located next to residential zoning and has been at its present location since 1922. The facility has three warehouses, an office and a garage. Total square footage is 123,000.  There are 55 bulk storage  tanks having a total storage capacity of 342,000 gallons of liquid product.\n\nSlack Chemical conducts extensive employee training to respond to any incident involving our own facility. Several  of our employees are  members of the local fire depatrment. Two employees serve on the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Jefferson County.  In 1999 six employees have attended New York States, HazMat 1st Responder Operations course. Another is schedulled to attend a 40 hour HazMat class in October 1999. In addidtion two employees have attended the county Incident Command Course and two have attended EPA's \"Sampling for Hazardous Materials\" course.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Slack Chemical employees would be the first people to respond to an incident. If the Emergency Coordinator (EC) determines that the incident meets the criteria to activate the Emergency Response Plan (ERP) he will put the plan in motion. Activation of the ERP wil simultaneously start the following activities:\n\n    1. Evacuation of the plant (if necessary)\n    2. Notifcation of LEPC\n    3. Notification of the Carthage  Fire Dept.\n    4. Notification of the Carthage Elementary School and neighbors in proximity to the plant.\n    5.

In the event the LEPC has been called they have the authority to order an evacuation, request the Jefferson County HazMat Response Team, request the Ft. Drum decomtamination unit and other supporting activities that will bring the necessary personnel and equipment to the scene to assist Slack Chemical's personnel in bringing an incident to conclusion.\n\nSlack Chemical has worked with the LEPC, the local fire department, the Carthage Elementary School and all of the agencies that would be involved in planning for such an incident. We have conducted table top scenarios and worked with the local fire dept in preplanning for an incident. Our employees receive regular training as prescribed by EPA,  DEC an OSHA to respond to such incidents. Slack Chemical can also call on OP-Tech (hazmat contractor) for assistance in controlling and cleaning up a hazmat incident."
