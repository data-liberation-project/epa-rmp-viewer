In the event the LEPC has been called they have the authority to order an evacuation, request the Jefferson County HazMat Response Team, request the Ft. Drum decomtamination unit and other supporting activities that will bring the necessary personnel and equipment to the scene to assist Slack Chemical's personnel in bringing an incident to conclusion.\n\nSlack Chemical has worked with the LEPC, the local fire department, the Carthage Elementary School and all of the agencies that would be involved in planning for such an incident. We have conducted table top scenarios and worked with the local fire dept in preplanning for an incident. Our employees receive regular training as prescribed by EPA,  DEC an OSHA to respond to such incidents. Slack Chemical can also call on OP-Tech (hazmat contractor) for assistance in controlling and cleaning up a hazmat incident."
