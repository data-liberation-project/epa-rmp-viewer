      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nIt is the policy of the Sethness Products Company to prevent the occurrence of hazardous material releases by attention to the design and maintenance of systems that handle the hazardous chemicals.  Emergency response policies include mitigation when possible within the abilities and training of the plant staff.  Should these efforts be insufficient, further intervention would be in active cooperation with community planners and first responders.  Sethness Products is an active member of the Clinton County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nThe Sethness Products Company produces caramel color for the soft drink and other industries by processing corn syrup.  29% Aqueous Ammonia is used as a reactant with the raw corn syrup to achieve the color desired by the customer.  \n\nTwo aqueous ammonia tanks exist that hold up to 212,654 pounds of 29% Aqueous Ammonia at ambient temperature.  Distribution piping containing 29% Aqueous Ammonia contributes a negligible amount of additional volume. \n\nThe programs in place to prevent releases focus primarily on prevention by design and maintenance.  The facility personnel work in concert to insure that design and system components are optimized for safe operation.  All proposed changes are reviewed by plant engineering staff to insure that system integrity is not compromised.  During this review, all activities such as inspection or maintenance are specified and integrated into plant operations.  Given the small facility staff, outside experts frequently provide or review designs for changes to the systems.  In addition to an aggressive safety program based on Job Safety Analysis, the facility is in compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) rules.  The plant safety program assures that management, engineering, and operations are informed of the hazards posed by 29% Aqueous Ammonia, and the actions required to maintain the system in safe condition.  The safety program has the full support of labor and "

      "SummaryText": "management.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a release, facility personnel would assess the seriousness of the problem and take appropriate action.  Actions would include evacuation of the facility, notification of emergency first responders, and if required, a call for help to the Quad Cities Hazardous Materials Team.  In order to provide rapid response to a problem, Sethness employees have been trained in the early detection of small leaks and catastrophic events that could result in large releases.  Employees, upon detection of incidental leak conditions, have training and equipment to make emergency repairs.  In the event of catastrophic failure due to a tornado or vessel failure, activation of the community response plan would be the primary response.\n\nWithin the last five years no release of 29% Aqueous Ammonia has had an impact on off-site receptors.  On January 28, 2001 a small release of 29% Aqueous Ammonia occurred as a result of a cracked pump suction pipe.  The release resulted in no on-site or off-site impact.  There were no injuries reported and no property damage.  Minor releases that have occurred are due to maintenance. All leaks whether minor or small are vigorously followed up to prevent reoccurrence. \n\nThe emergency response plan is designed to assure the safety of employees and neighbors.  Once safety of employees is assured, abatement of the release will be addressed.  Preventing hazardous concentration of vapors is the primary goal.  This will be accomplished by repairing faulty or damaged equipment, or the application of ?bandages.?  Should the problem have the potential to be beyond the capability or training of facility personnel, further mitigation and response will be coordinated with local first responders and (if necessary) the Quad Cities Hazmat team.\n\nAs a result of the hazard analysis for PSM, the 29% Aqueous Ammonia storage vessels were replaced and installed inside containment, and the truck unloading spot is also protected.
