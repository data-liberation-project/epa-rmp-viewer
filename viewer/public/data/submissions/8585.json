The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The prevention of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has a Plant Safety Program in place.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated with damage of property, and eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Randy Cline, Maintenance Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these p"

For that same period of time, there were no known off-site deaths, injuries, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place due to ammonia releases.\n\nF.Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  This program has been coordinated with the Athens-Clarke Emergency Management Agency and Athens-Clarke County Fire Department.\n\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:\n7 Organization Plan and Responsibilities\n7 Communications Procedures\n7 Detailed Action Plans\n7 First Aid Procedures\n7 Emergency Medical Treatment Procedures\n7 Evacuation Plans\n7 Description of Outside Assistance Available\n7 Site Re-Entry Procedures\n7 Training Programs and Drills\n\nG.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommendations were made for either the equipment (hardware) or the system operating procedures (procedural) when the most recent process hazard analysis (PHA) study was conducted.  The recommended changes have been evaluated by management and are being addressed and resolved in a timely manner."

      "SummaryText": "rograms prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid damage to property and the environment.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nB.Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSeaboard Farms of Athens, Inc., operates a poultry processing facility in Athens, Georgia. The facility operates ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7662-41-7) contained in the system is above the EPA threshold of 10,000 pounds.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and they are regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\n C.Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the refrigeration system at the facility involves the release of the entire contents of ammonia from the largest vessel on site over a 10-minute period due to the failure of the vessel.  This is conservative assumption as the liquid level within the unit is normally less than this amount.                                                                                                                                                                 \nThe worst-case release scenario related to the refrigeration system is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n7 The Worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n7 The High Pressure Receiver is located in an area with minimal traffic (e.g., forklifts);\n7 Industry standards have been followed for the manufacture and quality of the High Pressure R"

Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis in conducted.
