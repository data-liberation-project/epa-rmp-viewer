Forum Clackamas Campus Freezer has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\nIn the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, refrigeration contractor personnel are trained in the appropriate mitigation measures, relying on emergency services provided by the fire department and the hazardous materials response team. Forum Clackamas Campus will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM program.\n\nAll releases and near misses are recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored, and readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop policies and/or procedures that may prevent future incidents.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Forum Clackamas Campus Freezer facility is located at 9810 SE Mangan Way in Clackamas, Oregon. The facility is approximately 0.25 miles east of Interstate 205, and 1 mile south of the junction of Interstate 205 and Highway 224.

Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a Worst-Case Release Scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an Alternative Release Scenario. The regulations define a Worst-Case Release Scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThis facility has prepared Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for both processes. These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA but are presented in the RMP.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nForum Clackamas Campus Freezer prevention program is described in the RMP / PSM program.

The compilation of written process safety information must be complete before conducting any process hazard analysis required by the standard.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA process hazard analysis provides a thorough team evaluation of the ammonia refrigeration system. The purpose of performing a process hazard assessment is to discover, identify and address everything possible that can go wrong with the ammonia system and to then insert controls, thereby short-circuiting possible accidents.  \n\nBy studying the ammonia system through the consistent application of an established hazard analysis method, risks can be identified and prioritized. Current refrigeration science, historical accident information, industry lessons learned, and company and facility experience should be used in crafting a thorough analysis. These studies are powerful tools in reducing the likelihood and severity of system accidents. Natural and human cause external events were also considered in the process hazard analysis.\n\nOperating Procedures\nProcedures and policies are in place that establish how the refrigeration system is operated and maintained. Written operating procedures serve several purposes. First, established procedures can ensure that operators carry out jobs consistently and correctly, thereby avoiding dangerous mistakes.  Second, written procedures provide a means to communicate to individuals the proper way to perform tasks.  Finally, operators have access to information giving them guidance on how to respond to conditions. The standard operating procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they reflect the current operating practices.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPrevention is the primary reason regular and scheduled inspection, testing, and maintenance is performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.

The facility utilizes outside contractors to perform routine and emergency maintenance on the system.  \n\nIncident Investigation\nWritten procedures and forms are in place detailing how and when the facility must investigate accidental / incidental releases. The facility investigates releases and near misses that could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Recommendations are addressed and corrected by facility management. Completed reports are kept for five years and are reviewed as part of the process hazard analysis revalidation.\n\nTraining\nCurrently, the only individuals that carry out tasks in the refrigeration system are refrigeration contractor employees. Forum Clackamas Campus Freezer must ensure the refrigeration contractor certifies operators following completion of operator training and confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned. Refrigeration operators are given initial training on hazards of anhydrous ammonia, an overview of the refrigeration system, and emergency operations to name a few. To ensure compliance with the procedures, refresher training is conducted as required. Where possible, training utilizes direct experience in the field to facilitate task understanding and address multiple learning methods.\n\nEmployee (Tenant) Participation\nThe purpose of the employee participation provisions is to ensure that tenants are involved in creating and maintaining the PSM program. Decisions as to which tenants / individuals will be consulted regarding specific PSM/RMP matters will consider factors such as job functions, experience, and degree of involvement with PSM/RMP, as well as their general background.
