It was later determined that a total of approximately 315 pounds of chlorine escaped. Immediately after the leak was stopped Inframark hired contractors that decontaminated the chlorine building and replaced all the damaged chlorine supply equipment in the building.\r\n \r\nWe have since installed new vacuum feed and shut off systems that will and have prevented similar problems in the future.  New vacuum regulators were installed directly to the container, eliminating 16 connections and points of failure that existed with the wall mounted regulators. Auto-shutoff valve actuators were installed to each of the four containers."

A new SABA system has been purchased and put in service. Affected employees have had pulmonary function testing, fit testing, and have been trained in the use of SCBA along with the chlorine SOP. SOPs are annually reviewed and revised as necessary.  Copies of these procedures are maintained at the plant and are available to all Plant employees.  The Chief Plant Operator regularly observes plant employees as the follow these procedures to verify they are properly being followed.  The Chief Plant Operator provides individual instruction and review with employees as needed.  A safety observation plan, both peer to peer and management observations, has been instituted at the plant.\r\n\r\nAn Emergency Response Plan is prepared for the plant.  The plan describes emergency response actions to be taken on-site by plant personnel in the event of a chlorine release as well as by County, local and other emergency management personnel responding to a hazard emergency at the plant. The plan identifies responsibilities and procedures for community preparedness and response to a hazardous material (hazmat) incident at the plant. The plan also emphasizes procedures on how to limit the potential for releases and how to notify document and report accidents and address releases from the plant.  The plan was last revised in February of 2022. \r\n \r\nThe plant's five (5) year accident release history has been updated. On June 22, 2021 at 3:30 AM Inframark responded to a chlorine sensor alarm at the facility when a pressure gauge on the chlorine feed system failed, resulting in a chlorine gas emission into the local atmosphere. First responders on the scene were able to shut off the chlorine system at approx. 7AM and the immediate area surrounding the plant was placed in a stay-at-home order until"

      "SummaryText": "e should either the leak detection system alarm, set to alarm at 1 PPM, or a person manually activates the panic button, located at the alarm panel outside the building.\r\n\r\nGas chlorine is safely dosed from containers using remote vacuum gas chlorination equipment. The vacuum regulator is mounted directly on the container isolation valve using a lead gasket. Chlorine gas under pressure is fed to the inlet pressure reducing valve, the needle of which is seated on a diaphragm. At the water end of the system, pressure differential is applied across a venturi by a boost flow which causes the venturi to suck. This vacuum is applied to the diaphragm, causing the needle to be  pushed into the spring-loaded valve, thereby allowing chlorine gas to flow into the chlorinator. Gas chlorine under vacuum then proceeds through a flow regulating device (needle valve V notch) and through the vacuum tube to the venturi where it is dissolved in water.\r\n\r\nThe key feature of the gas chlorination system for water disinfection is that it operates completely under vacuum and is therefore inherently safe. If the booster pump stops or the venturi becomes blocked or the vacuum tube is broken, vacuum is lost at the chlorinator. The inlet pressure reducing valve immediately closes and the container or drum is completely isolated. Even if the container was to fall over and the body of the chlorinator was to smash, the inlet pressure reducing valve would still stay closed and no chlorine gas would escape.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine room has a chlorine gas detection device that sounds audio alarms as well as a visual alarm in the event of a leak. An alarm horn, and red beacon, are located on top of the chlorine building. An alarm horn located in the control building hallway and a green flashing beacon on the main control building. If chlorine is detected at 1 PPM the container valves are automatically actuated to close. Standard operational procedures have been re-written and implemented with all affected em"

Due to DARA contracting with Inframark for operations, the DRWPCC is subject to the requirements of Subpart C of 40 C.F.R Part 68, relating to Program 3 facilities.  The Plant's Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program and OSHA program are adhered to. John Wilson is the Project Manager and is the Plant's RMP Emergency Contact and the person who has the overall responsibility for implementing the RMP for the DRWPCC. \r\n \r\nThe DRWPCC located in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, is 44 miles west of Philadelphia.  Chlorine is used to disinfect wastewater prior to discharge to the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek.  The facility treats an average flow of 5.2 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater and has the capacity to store a maximum of 12,000 pounds (lbs) of chlorine on-site at any one time. Chlorine, a stationary source, at the facility is contained in four 1-ton (2,000 lb) containers that are on a standby/on-line basis to ensure the chlorination process is continuous. Chlorine is drawn from the 1-ton containers in a gaseous state. \r\n\r\nIn July of 2021engineering controls were placed to protect workers at the DRWPCC. Chlorine process improvements include container mounted vacuum regulators that will stop flow of Chlorine past the regulator should the system lose vacuum, leaks caused by the regulator system will typically be the result of a faulty lead washer or loosely threaded connection. The process has also been upfitted with automatic valve closers that will shut down the container valv"
