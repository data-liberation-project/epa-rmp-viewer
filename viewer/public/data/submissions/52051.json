      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC) Platteville Compressor Station (Station). The station is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention.  APC has an extensive operator and maintenance training program.  Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. APC?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies.  If the situation requires, APC will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies. \n\nLocation and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Platteville Compressor Station is located in Weld County at 15067 Weld County Road in a rural area which is used primarily for farming.  \n\nThe Station consists of four compression units; #91, #92, #93 and #94, that discharge 85 MMCF /D. Water is removed through glycol dehydration and CO2 and H2S are removed with an amine solution. Gas is then delivered via 8? and 10\" cleanable pipelines. The discharge pressure is not to exceed 1,220 psig. The station is equipped with inlet separation. \nLiquids separated (water and heavy hydrocarbons) are pumped into 10? cleanable pipeline.  \n\nThe purpose of the compressor station is to:\n\n1.Increase the pressure of the gas coming from the gathering system;\n2.Reduce the dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission or further processing.\nAnd\n3.Remove H2S and CO2 from the gas stream.\n\nThe Platteville compressor station receives gas from various gathering lines and supplies the pipeline(s) that transport the gas to a processing plant.

      "SummaryText": "he dew point is critical since the incoming gas contains moisture (water and heavy hydrocarbons) that need to be removed.  The amount of moisture in the gas varies from day to day depending on a great number of variables at the wells. The dew point increases as the concentration of moisture in the inlet gas increases.\n\nAs gas flows through the pipeline, its temperature will decrease to about the same temperature as the surrounding environment.  If this temperature is below the dew point of the gas, the water and heavy hydrocarbons will tend to condense.  The buildup of liquids can begin to restrict gas flow, particularly at orifices and bends in the pipe.  In extreme cold, hydrates may form and create a potentially dangerous ice plug.  \n\nAt the Platteville Station, in order to reduce the dew point of the gas and minimize the formation of hydrates, the inlet gas flows through a ?slug catcher? and ?inlet separator? physically separating the liquids. The gas is then compressed which causes some of the heavy hydrocarbons to condense out of the stream resulting in a lower dew point.  These condensed raw, natural gas liquids (NGL), also called condensate, are stored in tanks until there is a sufficient volume to be pumped into either a tank truck for transportation or pumped into a liquids pipeline.\n\nAfter compression, the gas is subjected to a liquid desiccant, Triethylene glycol (TEG), to further remove water.  The glycol is regenerated and used again.\n\nTheplants process  is raw NGL into NGL and gasoline through cooling and distillation processes.  These products are either pumped into pipelines or trucks for transport to customers.\n\nThe Station?s maximum intended inventory of flammable substances in a mixture is larger than the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.) of regulated flammable substances.  Therefore, the Station is subject to the EPA RMP Standard.\n\nHistory and Ownership\n\nThe Platteville Compressor Station was built by HS Resources in 2001. Kerr McGee (KMG) acquir"

      "SummaryText": "ed HS Resources in August, 2001. APC acquired Kerr McGee in the fall of 2006. \n\nProgram Level\n\nAPC has determined that Program Level 1 applies to the Platteville Compressor Station for the following reasons:\n\n1 The station has a documented Emergency Response Plan which has been coordinated with the local fire department;\n2 The station has not had a accidental release of the regulated substances (condensate) that directly or indirectly caused death, injury, or response/restoration activity for an environmental receptor in the previous five years; and\n3 The distance to any ?receptor? is greater than then calculated endpoint for the worse-case scenario of 0.3 miles. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Station has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect employees and the general public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect station, personnel, and regulatory changes.\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on various safety issues, such as flammable substances, are held regularly.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards through APC?s ?Near-miss? program.\n\nAccident History\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidents that meet the criterion for inclusion in this submittal."
