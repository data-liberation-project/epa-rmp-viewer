Description of Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nPreferred Foods, Inc. /a.k.a. Koch Foods, recognizes management's responsibility in the protection of its employees, equipment, property, the community, and environment. The safety and health of all personnel are highest priority. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish Preferred Foods, Inc.'s goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes governmental mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and practices that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of Preferred Foods, Inc.'s Safety Program is to achieve maximum safety performance, as individuals as well as a highly efficient manufacturing team.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with Preferred Foods Inc.'s Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program.  These programs are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68). Preferred Foods Inc.'s General Manager and Maintenance Manager are responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of accidental ammonia releases.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response program is also established for the preve"

As a whole these programs are designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injures and illnesses, and any physical property damage.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates a [NAICS #311991 (Perishable Prepared Food Manufacturer)] perishable meat manufacturing plant and freezer warehouse at 4100 Port Union Road, Fairfield, OH 45014.  A two-stage ammonia refrigeration plant is employed to freeze the manufactured product, maintain the storage, and holding freezer's temperatures.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates a two stage (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, which provides general cooling throughout the facility. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS#7664-41-7) contained in this refrigeration system is in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds to initiate OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and EPA's Risk Management Plan.  Preferred Foods Inc.'s maximum inventory in the refrigeration system is 27,000 pounds.  Due to the volume of ammonia and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, which could pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC. Summary of Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n1. Worst-Case\n\nO.C.A. data available to EPA upon request. \n\n\n\nPreferred Foods? PHA study indicates, the worst case scenario is unlikely due to the following:\n\n\n\n? Industry standards and quality controls were followed in the design and construction of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n.Local and National Codes and standards were consulted and included in system design.\n\n? Ammonia is not corrosive in this process.\n\n? Pressure safety relief valves limit the operating pressures in the receiver.\n\n? The facility utiliz"

The maintenance program includes a shift monitoring procedure of the refrigeration system by fully trained personnel.\n\n? Low level controls, level probe sensors for ammonia monitoring , and maintaining a safe ammonia liquid supply to the IC1 and/or LPRU1 acts as active mitigation before the release poses a threat to offsite receptors.\n\n? The piping is routed to avoid impact from traffic sources.  A majority of the pipes and control valves are located on the roof.\n\n? Forklift operators have been trained and certified by the company, and trained in the locations and operations of the ammonia refrigeration evaporators that are located within their working areas.\n\n?
