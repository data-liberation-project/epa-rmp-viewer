      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAt the Solutia Inc. Trenton site, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.\n\n\n\nThe plant's accidental release prevention program is built upon a comprehensive safety program which is RC-14001 and ISO 14001 certified.  This includes a variety of procedures, equipment and training.  These program components are designed to effectively prevent, mitigate and respond to potential release situations.  Routine inspection and preventative maintenance programs are used to ensure integrity of hazardous material storage tanks and key safety controls.  Process equipment changes are reviewed during the design phase for potential environmental, safety or health impacts.  Routine audits and inspections are performed to ensure correct procedures are followed.  Alarms, interlocks, spill containment, vapor supression, vent vapor collection and treatment systems are in place for control and mitigation of vinyl acetate releases.  Any release incident is investigated to identify prevention and improvement opportunities.\n\n\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n     *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n     *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n     *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n     *  An overview of our emergency response program\n\n     *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from\n\n        occuring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the envir"

In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nVinyl acetate monomer - On average 719,000 lbs stored onsite for use(in tanks) in polymerization reactors to manufacture speciality polyvinylbutryal polymers used for Safety Glass manufacture onsite and sold for speciality applications such as retro-reflective traffic safety signs and photographic applications.\n\n\n\nVinyl acetate monomer on rail spur - From 0 to 4 railcars (containing a maximum of 105 tons each) depending on railroad shipments stored onsite for use in the polyvinylbutryal process mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place for vinyl acetate include:  a management of change program, a detailed process hazard analysis or revalidation every five years, internal PSM audits, training programs which provide for both new hire and refresher training for personnel assigned to the area, detailed operating procedures, a contractor management process, pre-startup safety reviews, a hot work permit system, and mechanical integrity programs that provide for periodic inspection of critical equipment and the quality assurance of spare parts.\n\n\n\nVinyl acetate\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\nThe polyvinylbutryal process is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule.  Systems in place to improve safety and prevent release are:  vapor detectors in two sump locations to detect spills, reinforcement of the polymerization reactors to withstand deflagration without releasing vessel contents, nitrogen inerting of the main vinyl acetate storage tank with an oxygen analyzer to prevent a deflagration, numerous interlocks to prevent process exceedences, vapor detection within buildings, back up power generation for critical systems, and dedicated fire systems.   Rail car sittings are fitted with track pans that direct any potential spill to a containment sump.  \n\n\n\nVinyl acetate shipments into the plant are treated at the supplier with inhibiter to prevent polymerization reaction while in shipment and storage.  All vinyl acetate rail cars that enter the plant for unloading are sampled for identification and quality to prevent the accidental mixing of a different substance that could react in the storage tanks.\n\n\n\nThe storage tanks and reactors have chilled vent condensers to reduce emissions.  The reactors and collector tanks are equipped with back up cooling water and with automatic short stop systems that in an emergency can stop the reaction. Built in foam systems also exist for storage tanks.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The Trenton plant's release records have been reviewed for the period of 2014 to September 2019.  This review identified no releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant propert"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nAnnual drills are conducted with pertinent emergency responders to ensure response to a release would be conducted in a coordinated and organized manner.  Participants for our drills have included 6 local fire departments, 3 local police departments, Downriver Emergency Response Team, 2 local healthcare systems and the Hospital Emergency Management System, Wayne County Emergency Management Division/Office of Homeland Security, Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Committee, Trenton Emergency Command Center, United States Coast Guard, United States Border Patrol, Salvation Army, Wayne County Airport Authority, Grosse Ile Emergency Command Center,and the Environmental Protection Agency.  These drills, and future drills, demonstrates our commitment to preparing for emergencies should they occur and our commitment to ensure that our local, state, and federal support systems are in place and familiar with site activities.  Drills with outside agencies have been an ongoing event at this site for over 25 years.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and local response agencies and have around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick and effective response to an incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
