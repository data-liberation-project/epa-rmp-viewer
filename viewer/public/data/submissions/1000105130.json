It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to five process control systems.  \r\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\r\n1.3.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT (C)\r\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public and environment.  For chlorine, the distance the endpoint concentration of the gas could travel was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of Chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and churches were identified.  \r\nThe offsite consequence analyses was conducted included two chemical release case scenarios.  The first is a \u00bfworst case flammable release\u00bf.  The second is a worst case toxic release scenario\u00bf.  Both scenarios are defined by EPA, which states that \u00bfthe operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released within 10 minutes\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.

The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor.  The low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.
