The site is not a responding facility for releases of the RMP listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.  FOTE Senior Management are committed to the implementation of the RMP/PSM procedures.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe FOTE facility manufactures personal care products and has added an aerosol storage and an aerosol injection system at its Trinity West facility in Fort Worth, Texas.  The Trinity West facility has one covered process that includes unloading, storage and handling of the three listed aerosol propellants.  The RMP / PSM covered process boundary at FOTE Trinity West includes the propellant unloading, storage and gashouse operations.  Trucks bring the propellants onsite to unload each of the chemicals into its appropriate tank(s).  There are three propellant tanks, each with a design capacity of 6,565 gallons but limited to 85% of maximum tank capacity. The covered process boundary ends after the filling operations in the gashouse.  \n\n\n\nFOTE has reviewed plant storage and usage data and determined that three propellants onsite are listed RMP flammable chemicals.  The RMP threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds for flammable mixtures containing greater than one (1) percent by weight of a listed flammable component with a mixture National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability r"

The facility is also subject to the PSM regulations under the general flammable category. The required elements of the RMP prevention program are listed below:\n\n\n\n     Employee Participation\n\n     Process Safety Information\n\n     Process Hazard Analysis\n\n     Operating Procedures\n\n     Contractors\n\n     Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n     Mechanical Integrity\n\n     Hot Work Permit\n\n     Management of Change\n\n     Incident Investigation\n\n     Emergency Planning and Response\n\n     Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nThese items, their specific requirements, and how the FOTE Trinity West facility will comply with the requirements are addressed in the individual procedural documents.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe FOTE Trinity West facility has had zero (0) RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nFOTE is a non-responding facility with respect to the RMP-covered process chemicals. In the event of an emergency, FOTE will notify the local fire departments to respond and will evacuate their employees when needed.  Additional details related to emergency procedures can be located in the facility's Emergency Action Plan. \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nThe facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) on June 16, 2016, which identified several recommendations for enhanced process safety.  These recommendations are summarized in the PHA report and are currently under evaluation.\n\n"
