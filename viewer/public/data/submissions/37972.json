The Village is committed to achieving this goal.\n\nFacility and Chemicals Description\n\nThe Village of Mundelein is charged with the responsibility fro wastewater collection and treatment services for its 31,000 residents.  The Village of Mundelein is located within Lake County, Illinois.  The Village of Mundelein currently operates one Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), which treats an average of 3.1 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater.  The Village also maintains 95 miles of gravity sanitary sewer lines, 1.05 miles of force main sanitary sewer lines, and 57 miles of storm sewer lines.  The Village of Mundelein's RMP applies to the chlorination process.  The covered processes at the Village meet the RMP Program 3 eligibility requirements, because more tha 2,500 pounds of chlorine are stored on-site.\n\nThe WWTP uses chlorine primarily for disinfection, sand filter cleaning, and activiated sludge filamentous control.\n\nGeneral Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the EPA's RMP rule, the Village of Mundelein also complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Program.\n\nAt the WWTP, several practices are important to the prevention program.  These practices are:\n- Thorough training of all employees\n- Inspection of chlorine containers prior to accepting delivery.\n-Rigorous inspections twice a day of the chlorine container rooms.\n-Daily tests of the chlorine gas detector alarms.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases from covered processes have occurred.  No deaths, injuries, or property damage have occurred either on or off-site in the last five years.\n\nEm"
