If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with local fire departments, or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimuze the impact of the release on the public and the environment.\n\n2.  The Newport Fertilizer location is located about five miles south of London.  Newport is a fertilizer only facility that uses anhydrous ammonia for the direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 212,200 lbs in 2 storage tanks (1 - 18,000 gal and 1 - 30,000 gal).  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi truck holding 42,000 lbs.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the two storage tanks released as a gas over tne minutes.  The maximum released amount would be 212,200 lbs which represents the volume of the storage tanks at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 2.90 miles.\n\n4.  the alternative release scenario based on our five year accident history (or most likely incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n5.  The Newport facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, and OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.111.\n\n6.  There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage.\n\n7.  Newport has a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  They have also provided local fire and LEPC with right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\n8.  Our company policy is to remain proactive in the areas of safety and accident prevention.  With the ODA - Work"
