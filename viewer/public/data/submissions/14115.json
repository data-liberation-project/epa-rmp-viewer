      "SummaryText": "Glamourette Fashion Mills Inc. is a full fashion knitting company.  We are operating in Quebradillas since 1956.  We have in our plant 1,067 full time employees.  In 1991 we constructed our WWTP.  Since we started our WWTP we were in compliance with PRASA, also no accidental discharges of chlorine during those 8 years operation.  Preparing RMP submition to EPA we considered chlorine worst case scenario.  Refer to Section 2 Toxic 5 worst case.  Although we are very carefull loading and unloading 1 ton chlorine containers in our Waste Water Treatment Plant.  We considered one ton container chlorine discharge to be the worst case.  Also the following steps will be implemented. 1.  We  will reduce chlorine inventories from 8 to 2 one ton container by December our inventory will be around 4-1 ton container  2.  We will connect chlrine alarms inside the building.  3.  Air conditioner will stop with alarm.  4.  We will practice evacuation plan at least 3 times every year.  We practiced one last year.  5.  Also, we will coordinate these drills with Civil Defense, this will be done in august 1999.  Presently we are attending to COE meetings.  We are also attending on monthly basis to Civil Defense Emergency meetings- telephone (787) 882-6971. Mr. Hector Velez, Director."
