If a release should occur the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A response plan has been developed and coordinated with the local fire department in the event of a release.\n\nFacility info:\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the loading and unloading of trucks for sale of ammonia to plants and other facilities.  Anhydrous ammonia is brought in by tanker truck by Kaylor Ammonia personnel.  The ammonia is stored in two tanks of 8,000 gallons each.  The facility is located in a sparsely populated area of Crawford County and is unmanned.\n\nHazard Assessment:\n\nWorst Case Release result Scenario:\n\nThe worst case scenario is the release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in on tank which is 8000 gallons.  The release would occur in 10 minutes.  No passive or other mitigation were used.  \nThe most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used 1.5 meters/second and F stability.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.44 miles.\n\nAlternate Scenarios:\n\n The alternate scenario is the release during loading or unloading of the tanks.  This release will occur with one employee nearby.  It is assumed that this event would release 100 lbs/minute and should be able to be controlled in 4 minutes based on the EPA  model for refrigeration.  The distance to  toxic endpoint is 0.19 miles.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the OSHA Standard 1910.119.  The facility has a maintenance and inspection program in accordance with the OSHA standard and industry standards.\n\n\nFive Year Accident:\n\nThere have been no report of releases in the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:"
