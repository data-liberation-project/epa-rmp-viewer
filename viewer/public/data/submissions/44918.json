      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is used at the Breckenridge Water Treatment Plant for purposes of disinfecting treated water.  This Risk Management Plan for the City of Breckenridge Water Treatment Plant addresses measures to identify, address, and minimize risks associated with use of chlorine at the City's water treatment plant.  The Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed chlorine handling procedures (in Section II, pages II-42 through II-53) designed to minimize the potential for inadvertent release of chlorine from the facility. The City of Breckenridge Emergency Response Plan addresses planned steps the City takes in the event of a chlorine release.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility in one-ton cylinders which are offloaded from the delivery truck via hoist and monorail.  The facility is equipped with separate tank storage and chlorine feed rooms.  The facility is protected from unauthorized access by intruder resistent plant perimeter fencing.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized persons only.\n\nThe worst case chlorine release scenario for this facility involves release of the entire contents of a full chlorine cylinder.  In such a case chlorine gas would potentially travel 1.3 miles before dissipating in concentration to less than 3 parts per million (ppm) and could affect the entire city population. Under the alternative chlorine release scenario where a chlorine release occurs due to improper attachment of the tank regulator/vacuum assembly chlorine gas would travel 0.1 miles before dissipating to less than 3 ppm and would potentially affect fewer than 50 persons."
