      "SummaryText": "t is the policy of the AlliedSignal Green Island Plant to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, or environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property, and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health, and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of formaldehyde involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational plant emergency response plans, and the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment.  Coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community are also included in our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n \n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled\n \n The AlliedSignal Green Island Plant uses formaldehyde as a raw material in the manufacture of resin.  It is stored and handled in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified in the RMP Rule. Formaldehyde is purchased from an outside vendor and is delivered to the Plant via tank truck on an \"as needed\" basis.  The tanker's contents are unloaded by plant operators into an above ground bulk storage tank which is located in an outdoor tank farm.  The maximum capacity of the bulk storage tank is 144,000 lbs.  Formaldehyde is pumped from the bulk storage tank through an enclosed piping system into the production area where it is fed into the resin kettles.\n \n3. Worse Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n \nEPA's RMP Rule requires the Plant to prepare an analysis of a hypothetical worst case release of the chemicals covered by the RMP regulations."

      "SummaryText": "EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure.  EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate.  In addition, the release must take place during the worst possible weather conditions.  For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.  In addition, the Green Island site is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario for the chemicals covered by the RMP regulations.\n\n \n The offsite consequence analysis for a \"worst-case release scenario\" at the Green Island Plant's stationary source was performed for the largest single vessel of formaldehyde solution. This vessel has a maximum capacity of 144,000 lbs.  The vessel is a cylindrical steel tank located in an outdoor tank farm adjacent to the facility.  The tank sits on a solid concrete base with a concrete walled dike designed to contain the full contents of the vessel should a release occur.  The tank's actual operational storage content is maintained at an average of 75,000 lbs., which is intentionally below its maximum design capacity.  The parameters used for the worst-case release scenario for the formaldehyde source were those defined and pre-set by EPA in the RMP Rule for toxic liquids.\n \n In accordance with the RMP Rule, the maximum 144,000-lb. full capacity contents of the vessel were assumed to be released instantaneously to the surrounding dike and allowed to evaporate for one hour.  With these assumptions, the model run showed that there would be an offsite impact from this release.\n \n The Plant's \"alternate-case\" scenario is a hose uncoupling from a tank containing 46,000 lbs. of solution.  The hypothetical spill of 40,000 lbs. was of a 49 percent formaldehyde solution in water.  It was assumed that the 40,000 lbs. of solution was spilled into the dike over a 20 minute period."

General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Accident    \nPrevention Program\n\nAlliedSignal's prevention program for a Program Level 3 RMP facility is comprehensive, consisting of twelve elements.\n7 Process Safety Information\nThe Process Safety Information procedure is designed to help those involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.\nProcess Safety Information accumulated at the Green Island facility included information on: 1) the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by our resin process, 2) information on the technology of the process, and 3) information on the equipment design of the process.\n7 Process Hazardous Analyses (PHA)\nProcess Hazards Analyses are part of  OSHA's Process Safety Management Directive.  A PHAwas completed at our facility and it included an analysis and review of areas used in the transport, storage, or processing of resin. The Hazards and Operability Method was used to perform this Process Hazards Analyses. The information generated from the analyses was formalized into a safety improvement action plan with specific time frames and responsibility assigned for completeness. \n7 Operating Procedures\nThe purpose of operating procedures is  provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in all of our processes.\n All of the resin production processes were identified and specific written instructions were addressed for each process including operating phases, operating limits, emergency actions, safety and health considerations, and safety systems.
