The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\nC Introduction;\nC ATOFINA Chemicals' policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\nC Hazard Assessment;\nC Prevention Program;\nC Five-Year Accident History;\nC Emergency Response Plan; \nC Planned changes to improve safety; and\nC Clean Air Act Amendments Title V Permit Status.\n\n\nATOFINA Chemicals' Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at ATOFINA Chemicals for many years; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  ATOFINA Chemicals is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Senior management routinely dedicates time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the management team and the Joint Health, Environmental and Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, implement enhancements, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of ATOFINA Chemicals= HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nATOFINA Chemicals= HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill ATOFINA Chemicals= commitment to health, environment, and safety.

The regulations also specify that alternative accidents (ones that are more realistic) be included.\n\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe toxic worst-case accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of a chlorine railcar containing 180,000 pounds.\n\nThe flammable worst-case accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of a dimethylamine railcar containing 167,000 pounds.  This quantity was assumed to be released instantly in the worst case scenario resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nIt should be noted that the worst-case scenarios are extremely unlikely events.  For a worst-case scenario to occur, all of the following would have to happen:\nC Everything held in the largest vessel is released;\nC All of the chemical in the vessel is released very quickly over a ten minute period;\nC All safety controls fail at once;\nC There is no strong wind or moderate breeze to dilute vapors;  and\nC No mitigating action is taken.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan includes information on mitigation and prevention measures implemented by ATOFINA Chemicals to reduce the risk of these types of events.\n\n \nWorst-Case Release Mitigation Measures\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive measures make it very unlikely that a complete failure of a  chlorine or dimethylamine railcar will occur.

On July 14, 2001, there was a release of methyl mercaptan vapors/liquid from a railcar.  The methyl mercaptan subsequently ignited creating a fire.  As a result of the fire, sections of flexible hoses on an adjacent chlorine car were damaged, resulting in a release of primarily chlorine vapor.  It is estimated that 26,000 to 27,000 lbs of chlorine was \n\n\nreleased.  Substantially all of the methyl mercaptan (approximately 147,750 lbs) was released in a combusted form during the incident.
