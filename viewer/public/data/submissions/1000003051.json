This document has been\nprepared to satisfy multiple regulations and is governed by the following agencies:\n\u00c2\u00b7 OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Code of Regulations, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly\nHazardous Chemicals (PSM)\n\u00c2\u00b7 Federal EPA\u00c2\u00bfs, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\nRequirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3\nRequirements (RMP)\nThe purpose of this document is to:\n\u00c2\u00b7 Increase the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring\nproper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\n\u00c2\u00b7 Assist Merchants Terminal and local government agencies in their communication and\ncoordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling regulated substances.\nThis document addresses Merchants Terminal administrative and operational programs to prevent\naccidents related to regulated substances and to reduce potential risks. The regulated substance of\nconcern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration\nfor warehouse cold storage and dock operations.\nThis Executive Summary contains tables outlining the PSM/RMP sections. It includes the purpose,\nfrequency of use, responsibilities and requirements, and forms for each section of the PSM/RMP\nprogram.\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nMerchants Terminal operates a refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary\nrefrigerant. The refrigeration system is located in the main building.\nMechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat\nexchanging fluid t"

The information to be compiled about the chemicals needs to be\ncomprehensive enough for an accurate assessment of the fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity\nhazards, the health and safety hazards to workers, and the corrosion effects on process equipment as well\nas monitoring and safety related equipment. MSDS information can provide a portion of the required\ndata but other information will be required.\nProcess technology information is also required. This includes information on the amount of hazardous\nmaterial stored and used at the facility as well as operating limits for the process. Diagrams of the\nsystem and information on all of the equipment utilized in the system are required. Piping and\ninstrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are required in the Process Hazard Analysis and are included in the\nProcess Safety Information.\nFrequency of Use Responsible Party Requirements\nUpdate if a change is made and\ntrain operators at least every three\nyears\nDirector of\nEngineering or\nDesignee\nMake available to all employees who work on or near the\nequipment of the ammonia process.\nRelated Form:\n\u00c2\u00b7 NOT APPLICABLE\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is the basis for many of the decisions and procedures associated\nwith an effective PSM/RMP program. It is a systematic effort to determine the potential hazards\nassociated with the process and to evaluate mitigation alternatives including equipment modifications,\nprocedural modifications, training, and administrative controls.
