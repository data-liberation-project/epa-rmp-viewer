The Tanner family started out in the ammonia business in 1954 with the purchase of National Ammonia Company in Philadelphia, PA. The company has grown to it\u00bfs current  through the acquisition of three other ammonia companies, Bower Ammonia and Chemical Co. in 1971, Northeastern Ammonia Co. in 1985, and Hamler Industries in 1991. This particular facility was established in 2007.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Tanner Industries, Inc. is to constantly improve our products and services to meet or exceed our customers needs, to distribute our products in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner, and to generate a reasonable return in order to provide continuity for the business and employment for our employees. \r\n\r\nTanner Industries, Inc. is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as it applies to the safe distribution of ammonia. Our commitment to Responsible Distribution (RD) provides our company with an integrated health and safety, environmental, and product stewardship program that is supported by our strong corporate capabilities. Our dedication to the proper distribution and stewardship of ammonia includes involvement in emergency response training for first responders and other industry personnel to enhance the protection of our employees and community neighbors. \r\n\r\nTann"

      "SummaryText": "er Industries, Inc. is a distributor of anhydrous ammonia. We are not a manufacturer. The material is transported to our facility by rail car or tank truck and then transferred from this equipment to either our on-site storage vessels or transport cargo tanks. From the storage vessels the material can be repackaged for bulk or non-bulk distribution to end-users.\r\n\r\nAt this facility, blending of a product we call aqua ammonia is also performed. This material, ammonium hydroxide, is a solution of ammonia and water. In order to avoid minor releases of anhydrous ammonia vapor, our handling processes institute closed loop systems that capture the ammonia gas in water. This solution is transferred into a process vessel where the volume is increased and the ammonia concentration standardized for distribution into the commercial market. \r\n\r\nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\r\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses. The largest users of\r\nammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a fertilizer. Some\r\nagricultural businesses combine ammonia and other chemicals and nutrients to form more complex\r\nfertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles, pharmaceuticals, cleaning\r\nsolutions, dyes, inks and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used by some companies in various\r\nprocesses. Ammonia is recognized as an ozone safe refrigerant. This means that, unlike other refrigerants, any ammonia releases into the atmosphere will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Besides refrigeration, Ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, reprographics, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\r\n\r\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\r\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages. Accompanied\r\nwith a very pungent odor, ammonia can be said to be au"

Liquid ammonia or\r\nammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce serious chemical burns requiring prompt medical\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nEmployees and contractors who work around ammonia should take the extra precautions of reviewing\r\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets, wearing appropriate safety equipment and participating in special training\r\nprograms as prescribed by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\r\n\r\nSafety Improvement Process:\r\nSafety improvement is a corporate wide philosophy.

These committees meet on a periodic basis to review safety concerns at our sites as well\r\nas at our customer facilities. The management representatives of the site specific committee report directly to the corporate safety committee. The corporate safety committee is comprised of upper management,compliance personnel, headquarters employees, and field personnel that are familiar with plant processes. This committee meets on a regular basis to review accident and injury investigations, evaluate site specific issues, provide recommendations and implementation guidance. Also, qualified personnel periodically inspect and evaluate each facility to assess safety and maintenance conditions. The results of these facility inspections are reported directly to upper management and the operations department. As a whole, these systems provide Tanner Industries, Inc. with a continuous process for the identification of safety improvement opportunities thus reducing any risk to"
