      "SummaryText": "Luke Oil & Fertilizer, Inc. has served the farming community of Ocilla, Georgia for over 40 years.  We have an emergency response plan and an accident prevention program in place at our facility.  We cooperate with public emergency planning and response agencies on a regular basis to develop and maintain contingency plans in case of an accidental chemical release.  Our employees attend procedural safety and emergency response classes regularly.  This policy has allowed us to remain accident free for more than five years.\n\nOur Anhydrous ammonia tank is inspected on a regular basis to ensure safe, reliable operation.  Safety placards are placed around the facility, on the tanks and the fill stations.  The facility's single 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank is equipped with pressure relief valves, gas pressure gauges, and a liquid fill level gauge to prevent overpressurization and overfilling beyond the 80% administrative limit.  The transfer pipes are equipped with excess flow devices that will shut off the flow of ammonia in the event of a pipe or hose failure.  The tank, piping and hoses also feature manual shutoff valves that can be closed to stop a leak and isolate the damaged component for repair.  A continously monitored alarm system has been installed on the storage tank to prevent the unauthorized transfer of ammonia.  When triggered, the system will alert local law enforcement and emergency response agencies to respond.  There is a water supply located at the ammonia transfer station in case it is needed for mitigation of a release or decontamination of a equipment or personell."
