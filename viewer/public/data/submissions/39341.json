Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Ag Production Company, Turlock facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 3106 S. Faith Home Rd, Turlock, Ca., 95380 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of  anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n?  The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\n?   Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The  pesticides are received, stored and distributed for direct application in pest control.\n\n?  Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck or rail car and stored in  51 above ground tank(s) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 220,000  pounds.\n\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 160,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by reg"

The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from 2 inch pipe or hose size diameter.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.60 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\nRegulated Pesticides: The Facility has implemented provisions of the National Fire Protection Association and Uniform Fire Code for the storage of pesticides at their facility;  U.S. OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.38, \"Employee emergency response plan and fire prevention plans\"; and U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120, \"Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.\"   \n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nIdentify no release  for each regulated substance\n\n?  There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, or regulated pesticides in the past five years that:\n\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n-have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\n ?OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n ?OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\n ?Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.
