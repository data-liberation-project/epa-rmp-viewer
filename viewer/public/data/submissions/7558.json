      "SummaryText": "The major objective of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals into locations that could expose employees and the surrounding communities to serious hazards.\n\nThis RMP pertains to the High Plains Corporation's Ethanol Facility located in Sedgwick County, Kansas.  The Facility processes corn and sorghum to produce fuel grade ethanol, carbon dioxide, and a high protein cattle feed.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used in the process to adjust and control pH during the initial breakdown of starch to sugar.  Ammonia also provides essential nutrients to the yeast that process sugar to alcohol.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored at the facility in quantities no greater than 127,500 lbs.\n\nThe process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that effect the process are all considered in this plan.  Through this plan, we intend to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic chemicals as these releases could result in toxic hazards and cause harm to persons or the environment.\n\nChemical Safety Statement\n\nHigh Plains Corporation owns and operates a manufacturing plant converting corn and sorghum grain into fuel ethanol.  At the Colwich Ethanol Facility, safety is a way of life both on and off the job.  Personal injuries can be prevented and no job is so important that it should be performed in an unsafe manner.  Safety at this plant is the responsibility of all employees.\n\nManagers and Supervisors are responsible for the safety of all persons who report to or are assigned to them.  This responsibility is carried out by assuring that a sound Safety Program is in place including designing, maintaining and operating equipment in a safe manner, assuring training and education is completed for safe work methods and establishing and enforcing safe operating and"

The facility is committed to recycling or recovery of all possible process streams and the mitigation of releases and emissions using best business practices.\n\nSystems, procedures, and methods are in place to prevent the spill or release of any chemical to the environment and to respond and contain any inadvertent or accidental release.  These policies are explained in detail in the Emergency Action Plan and the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, including Spill Containment and Countermeasures.  Additional safe work methods and chemical specific data are outlined in the Hazardous Communication Program and the Process Safety Training Manuals.\n\nInformation pertaining to the Technology of the Process: The below listed information is the minimum amount of information we have acquired:\n\n7 A block flow diagram or simplified process flow diagram\n7 Process chemistry\n7 Maximum intended inventory\n7 An evaluation of the consequences of deviations, including those affecting the safety and health of employees, and the affect on the surrounding communities.\n\nInformation pertaining to the Equipment in the Process: The below listed information is the minimum amount of information we have acquired:\n\n7 Materials of construction\n7 Piping and instrument diagrams (P&ID)\n7 Relief system design and design basis\n7 Design codes and standards employed\n7 Material and energy balances\n\nTraining program:\n\nEach employee presently involved in operating the process and all employees before being involved in operating a newly assigned process are trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures pertinent to this policy.

Hazard communication training is the beginning of our training program for all employees.  We continue with training programs that inform employees of standard operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency evacuation, safety procedures, routine and non-routine work authorization activities, confined space entry, lockout/tagout, and many other areas as necessary to protect the employee and process. \n\nOur training uses many aspects of current training techniques: these include hands-on, classroom, on-the-job, video programs, written materials and any other technique necessary to provide clear and effective training to our employees.  Employees are fully informed as to the goals and objectives of the training and what is considered acceptable performance for duties they are to perform.  All employees are tested or quizzed to assure their competence and knowledge in each area of training.\n\nSpecific training in the operating procedures, control, precautions, pre-startup, mechanical integrity, inspection, testing, quality assurance, hot work permits, management of change, and emergency planning and response is provided for all employees working and involved with highly hazardous chemicals at our facility.  \n\nRefresher training shall be provided as determined.  Our procedures are designed to assure that the employee involved understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.  Once training has been completed and the employee is \"on the job\", there will be an evaluation of the employee's performance. If this evaluation is below acceptable performance levels, we will further train the employee to provide the described results and resolve any deficiency.

This record contains the identity of the employee, the dates of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nThe intent of the High Plains Corp. incident investigation is to identify the underlying causes of these incidents and implement steps to prevent similar events from occurring.  We perform these incident investigations to learn from past experiences and thus avoid repeating past mistakes.  Incidents are events that are sometimes referred to as \"near misses,\" meaning that a serious consequence did not occur, but could have.  For this reason, we intend to investigate all incidents and especially those that resulted in, or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical in the workplace.\n\nAll incident investigations will be promptly documented and shall never be initiated later than 24 hours following the incident.  Time is of the essence when performing an incident investigation so that facts do not become confused with the passage of time.\n\nInitiation of the incident report is the responsibility of the supervisor in charge.\n\nEmployees in the process area where the incident occurs will be consulted and interviewed.  Their knowledge of the events represents a significant set of facts about the incident that occurred.  The cooperation of employees is essential to an investigation.  The focus of our investigation is to obtain facts, and not to place blame.  The investigation process will clearly deal with all involved individuals in a fair, open, and consistent manner.\n\nThe report prepared at the conclusion of the investigation will include the following at a minimum: Date of incident, time and date investigation began, a complete description of the incident, all factors that contributed to the incident, and all recommendations resulting from th"

These plans include emergency evacuation as per current OSHA guidelines (29 CFR 1910.38).  All employees are trained regarding their responsibility in this plan when hired and annually thereafter.  Full details of the emergency action plan are maintained in the company safety manual, copies of which are accessible to all employees and contractors.\n\nAnnual training and drills are conducted to ensure that our employees are equipped to act promptly and professionally to an emergency.\n\nWe also have supplied the local emergency response planning committee with information regarding our hazards, site plan, and facility layout, as well as information pertaining to our worst case and alternative scenarios.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nHigh Plains Corp. will use compliance audits as a technique to gather sufficient facts and information, to verify compliance with current standards.  A team will be used to perform audits of the process safety management system and risk management program.  These audits will be conducted at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed under this program are adequate and are being followed.\n\nAudit team members will be selected on the basis of their experience, knowledge, and training and are familiar with the processes and auditing techniques, practices, and procedures.

The EPA approved the model used.\n\nThe results of the worst-case model indicated a toxic endpoint of 7.62 miles.  This worst case scenario indicates that a catastrophic release could impact the City of Colwich, Kansas, and/or the Cities of Bently, Andale, Maize and Northwest portions of the Wichita metropolitan area. There are no environmental receptors within the 7.62 mile radius.\n\nThe results of the alternative scenario indicated a toxic endpoint was 0.39 miles.  The estimated population within this distance was 26 people.  The primary use of the land in the vicinity is light industrial or agricultural.  There are no environmental receptors within the 0.39 mile radius."
