The Executive Summary contains elements that we have designed and implemented including(1)A discription of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation(2)An overview of our accidental release prevention program(3)A five year accident history documenting accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia an EPA RMP regulated chemical(4)An overview of Fieldale Farms emergency response program(5)An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment. \n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:   \nFieldale Farms Corporation processes poultry.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration equipment to keep the raw poultry cool or frozen during processing or storage.  Anhydrous ammonia has been identified by the EPA under the clean air ace Section 112(r) as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental relesase.  Our facility qualifies as a Risk Management Program 3 facility because we also are covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management(PSM) rule 29 CFR 1910.119.  \nToxics:  \nAnhydrous ammonia is a toxic gas regulated by EPA under the clean air act section 112(r) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.
