              "Description": "Wastewater Treatment. The City of Apopka's prevention program required under 112R was developed and implemented prior to the June 21, 1999 Risk Management Program deadline. The City's program involved a detailed approach to evaluate all components of the chlorination process: design, technology, and operation and maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and training requirements. After evaluating the chlorine process, the City took a proactive approach to ensure that chemical inventories were maintained at a minimum, without effecting the treatment process. Safety and training programs were updated. The City continues its commitment to ensure public safety in the event of a release. All leak detection equipment is connected to the SCADA system that communicates directly to the Fire Department Communications for immediate dispatch of a HazMat team in the event of a release. The city of Apopka takes seriously its responsibility to operate the Water Reclamation Facilty in a safe manner and has therefore taken the above mentioned proactive measures.",

If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to contact the City of Apopka Fire Communications dispatcher, at 911 or 407-703-1757 and request emergency response. The area leak detection equipment is connected to the facility SCADA system that immediately contacts the Fire Department in the event of leak detection for emergency assistance. The City of Apopka Fire department is equipped with a trained Haz Mat team that is qualified to respond to these types of emergencies.\n                                                                                                                                                                                      This facility is a municipal Water Reclamation Facility. Chlorine is used to disinfect our effluent, which is used for public access reuse irrigation. Chlorine is used and stored in 1-ton containers in a covered building next to the chlorination system. The chlorination system consists of up to eight 1-ton containers. This facility uses two tank mounted, vacuum operated regulators with one container feeding at all times and 1 container hooked to the system and ready for automatic switch-over when the container that is feeding empties. In the event of a leak anywhere in the feed system, the regulator will pull a vacuum and stop chlorine feed to the system. \n                                                                                                                                                                                  Worst-case scenario is a release of chlorine from the total failure of a 1-ton cylinder.

This event produces minimal release, as the chlorine gas piping operates under a vacuum and will stop feeding at the moment of vacuum loss. It is estimated that less than one pound of chlorine gas would be released in this scenario. The EPA's RMP*Comp v.107 calculates the distance endpoint for this quantity at less than 0.10 miles.
