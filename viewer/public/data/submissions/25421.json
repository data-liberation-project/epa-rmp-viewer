The recovered tar is sent to customers to be distilled into various tar products.\n\nThe partially cooled gas is then passed through direct contact primary coolers, coke oven gas compressors, and final coolers.  After the final coolers, ammonia is removed from the gas by scrubbing with a recycled solution of ammonium phosphate in the PHOSAM process and fractionated into anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFollowing the PHOSAM system, the coke oven gas is further processed by a computer controlled, cryogenic system, where the gas is cooled to an extremely low temperature, into several specific streams.  The separation provides two clean fuel streams used for the coke oven batteries and down river fuel system.  Approximately 40 percent of the coke oven gas is used for underfiring the coke ovens and the remainder is used for steam generation and heating purposes at USS's Mon Valley Plants.\n\nA third process stream separates out light oil and acid gases.  After the light oil is removed, this portion of the coke oven gas is processed for the removal of hydrogen sulfide in a conventional carbonate absorption and vacuum stripping system.  The light oil recovered in the cryogenic system is sent to a storage area for shipment to refiners. \n\nThe contaminated process waters from the Clairton complex are collected and sent to a contaminated water treatment system for the removal of contaminates prior to discharge into Monongahela River.  This system includes settling tanks, ammonia stills and a biological treatment system.\n \nClairton Works has submitted a CAA Title V application for an operating permit, but has not received an operating permit from Allegheny County.  \n\nSummary of Major Hazards - The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nCoke oven gas (COG) and its associated processes are exempt from the Risk Management Plan because all COG is used on-site as a fuel.\n\nAnhydrous"

      "SummaryText": "ammonia and its associated processes fall under the requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program because they contain quantities greater than the threshold.  These processes are classified as prevention program level 3.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is a corrosive, colorless gas with a penetrating, suffocating odor of household ammonia.  It is lighter than air and non-flammable.   The vapors can be irritating and harmful to the eyes, respiratory system and skin.  Under pressure, anhydrous ammonia is a colorless liquid and is transported as a liquid.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a household cleaner, fertilizer, refrigerant for cold storage, and in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source:\n\nClairton Works developed and implemented the risk management practices associated with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Plan, 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe United States Steel Corporation adopted a Statement of Policy concerning Environmental Management in October of 1991.  In the Environmental Management Policy, the United States Steel Corporation emphasizes its commitment to leadership and stewardship in protecting the environment and the intent to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  The policy also seeks to reduce waste and achieve minimal adverse impacts on the air, water and land through programs, which incorporate responsible environmental management. The statement stresses that environmental protection is a primary responsibility of every employee.  In May 1998, the USS Clairton Works' Environmental Management System became certified to the ISO 14001 standard emphasizing this commitment.\n\nThe safety program of the United States Steel Corporation, H.E.L.P.

The EERP addresses hazards caused by leaks, spills, floods, fires, power failures, mechanical failure, and human error.

Steel Clairton Works\n\nEPA Risk Management Program - Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\nParagraph \u00a768.155, Executive Summary, states:  The owner of operator shall provide in the RMP and executive summary that includes a brief description of the following elements:\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Clairton Works of the United States Steel Corporation (USS) is located in Clairton, Allegheny County Pennsylvania.  The facility is located 20 miles south of Pittsburgh on 392 acres along 3.3 miles of the west bank of the Monongahela River.  USS's Clairton Works manufactures metallurgical coke in chemical recovery ovens.  The facility's standard industrial classification (SIC) code is 3312, and North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 331111.\n\nCoal received from barges or the plant coal storage piles is blended, pulverized and conveyed into storage bunkers in the coke battery area of the plant.  In the coke ovens, coal is heated in 12 to 25 ton batches in the absence of air for approximately 18 hours at 2000 degrees F, yielding metallurgical coke, coke oven gases, and various coal chemicals.  When the coking process is complete in an individual oven, the contents are pushed into a railroad-quenching car.  The quench car is moved to one of a number of quench towers where the coke is cooled with river water.  The coke is conveyed to screening stations where it is sized prior to being shipped. \n\nDuring the coking process, coal volatiles exit the ovens through ascension pipes and goosenecks and are collected in overhead mains running the length of each coke oven battery.  These hot gases withdrawn under vacuum are initially cooled by spraying with recirculated flushing liquors.  Most of the tar in the raw gas drops out with this initial cooling.  Condensed tar and flushing liquor flow into decanter tanks where the tar is separated from the water phase.  The excess flushing liquor, which is the result of both water"
