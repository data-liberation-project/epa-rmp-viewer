We have installed new bulk heads at each stationary tank, along with a new liquid pump at our West Stationary Tank and East Stationary tank.  Our nurse wagons have been pressure, visually, and thickness tested up to date.  We recently installed new Safety Tripod Couplers, as well as Pressure Relief Valve Manifolds on our Stationary tanks. New Emergency signage has been added to the facility as well. Concrete barricades have been installed around each of our storage tanks.  Bleed off water storage has been added for safe vapor release of chemical left in hose at time of tanker trailer filling our storage tanks. "
