The facility handles Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS 7664-41-7, which is listed as Federal Regulated Substance in quantities greater than the Federal Threshold Quantities.\nThis facility is required to comply with Program 3 requirements since it exceeds the federal threshold level of 10,000lbs. and public receptors are located within the worst-case accidental release toxic end point area. The total quantity of ammonia currently at the site is approximately 24,000 lbs.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nSEMCO South Cooling utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations.  These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases.  Onsite personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment, as required.\nOnsite personnel provide initial emergency response.  Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other onsite personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aide response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractor would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nSEMCO South Cooling utilizes anhydrous ammonia in their precooling and cold storage operations.  Fresh produce is brought from the fields and cooled to remove field heat.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e produce is then stored in a cold storage warehouse. \nAll refrigeration equipment is tied together to form a single common system.  This equipment consists of portable and permanently installed equipment.  The refrigeration system configuration includes three compressor skids, a tower-frame evaporative cooling condenser and high-pressure receiver, a low-pressure receiver with pumps, a Self Contained Automatic Transfer (SCAT) ice machine, an ice maker, one half-car vacuum tube, one full-car vacuum tube, a refrigeration trailer, cold room evaporators, and safety equipment, including a refrigerant discharge diffusion tank.  \nThe system is operated in full configuration during the growing season from November to April.  Operations may continue at a reduced level in the off-season.\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nSEMCO South maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.  There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release.\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.  Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  There are emergency shut off switches for shutting down the system.  An alarm and de"

There is an emergency control box for manual pressure release. Preventive maintenance and safety inspections are used to insure equipment and piping is maintained and operating in a safe manner.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nAccording to SEMCO South Cooling Personnel, since startup there has been one release of anhydrous ammonia. The quantity of release was below the reportable threshold and no injuries resulted, however it was reported to the appropriate authorities. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nSEMCO South Cooling is in the process of writing a Business Response Plan. Upon completion, this plan will provide emergency contact personnel information, general emergency response procedures, hazardous material release reporting procedures, chemical inventory information, and emergency evacuation procedures.\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures.  The emergency coordinator is responsible for contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release.  The coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary, and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. \n\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nAdditional risk reduction measures may be implemented to further reduce the potential for an accidental release. These measures may include installation of upgraded piping and equipment supports, installation of equipment labeling, and implementation of program aimed specifically at the maintenance, training, and emergency response procedures for the ammonia based refrigeration equipment."
