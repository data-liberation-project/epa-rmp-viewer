There are also separate\n\nOSHA standards for acrylonitrile and butadiene.  BASF Corporation's Monaca Site complies fully \n\nwith these standards.  In addition, all raw material storage tanks and transfer activities are \n\ncontinuously monitored to ensure that safe conditions are maintained. \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release over the past five years which meets the reporting\n\ncriteria.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.
