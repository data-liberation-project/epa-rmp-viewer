These chemicals are used to manufacture polymer dispersions.  The polymer dispersion most commonly known by the general public is the latex in latex paint.  Polymer dispersions are also commonly used in products such as pressure-sensitive adhesives like those used in masking tape, building materials such as caulking and stucco, and paper coatings for such items as magazines and food cartons.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility operates in compliance with the EPA Risk\r\nManagement Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care Management System.  There are also separate\r\nOSHA standards for acrylonitrile and butadiene.  BASF Corporation's Monaca Site complies fully \r\nwith these standards.  In addition, all raw material storage tanks and transfer activities are \r\ncontinuously monitored to ensure that safe conditions are maintained. \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThis facility has had no accidental release over the past five years which meets the reporting\r\ncriteria.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.
