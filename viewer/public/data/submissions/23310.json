This is accomplished to a great extent by a well developed, up-to-date implemented Risk Management Proigram. All USCS facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner. It shall be the responsibility of the plant manager to ensure that all procedures are followed as set forth in our Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs. In the unlikely event of an accidental release it is USCS policy to immediately call the National Response Center, Local Emergency Response Committee, the local Fire Department and other agency(ies) that may be required. All USCS facilities will have an emergency response team to assist these agency(ies).\n\nUnited States Cold Storage, Orlando, Sand Lake Road is a public refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia as an refrigerant in a closed loop system. Anhydrous ammonia, most commonly known as ammonia, is an excellent refrigerant and is commonly used in most of the world's industrial refrigeration systems. Ammonia has an excellent warning property, its odor. Ammonia's odor is familiar to most people due to the fact  that it is commonly used in household cleaning solutions. Ammonia can be detected as low as 5 parts per million (PPM) and has an average life span of 7 days in the environment before it breaks down to its common elements nitrogen and hydrogen.\n\nTypical items stored within USCS facilities are raw or processed food items that can be found in any supermarket or restaurant. Temperatures ranges between -30 degrees to +45 degrees F. Most of the refrigeration equipment and piping are located inside the facility. However, there are a few exceptions, the condensers and related piping,  the piping for the truck and rail docks evaporators are all located on the warehous roofs.  In an unlikely event of a refrigerant leak in a refrigerated space, the ammonia vapor would be cont"

The machine room contains most of the large refrigerating machinery and vessels. The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors throughout to help lessen any leaks that might occur and to provide an early alert.\n\nUSCS believes that prevention is foremost. All USCS facilities are maintained by a staff of trained maintenance personnel. Most of these people are members of the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) and all Chief Engineers are members of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). USCS has on staff at the corporate level an OSHA and EPA coordinator/trainer who is a certified OSHA Instruvtor.  All facilities complys with OSHA's Process Safety Management without regard to the ammonia threshold quantity.  All the vessels and piping have been installed according to ASME vessel and piping codes and applicable local Building, Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plan, 29 CFR 1910.38,  1910.119, Process Safety Management and OSHA's 1910.120 HAZWOPER standards. We have trained  employess for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response  plan.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nUSCS Sand Lake Road facility has been operating at this location for the past 27 years. Within that long history the facility  has not experienced any accidents or releases.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS:\nWorst-case release scenario analysis: As required by law, under  40 CFR Part 68.25, Worst-case release scenario analysis, an analysis was prepared for the Sand Lake facility.

Releasing 150 pounds per minute for a 10 minute with  passive mitigation system in place. The Sand Lake facility has offsite consequence.\n\nThe dispersion analysis used a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an \"F\" atmospheric stability class. With an ambient temperature of 77 degrees F (25C) and a relative humidity of 50%. Using a release height at ground level and a surface roughness class of Urban.  Dense gas was used for gas density.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis: As required by law under 40 CFR Part 68.28, Alternative release scenario analysis, an alternative analysis was prepared for the Sand Lake facility. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program Comp. a computer based program was used for this analysis. The alternative release scenario is estimated to create a distance to reach off-site in any direction to an endpoint of 200 ppm from an accidental release of ammonia used as a refrigerant in a closed-loop refrigeration system. The Sand Lake facility has offsite consequence.\n\nThe alternative release scenario was a mechanical seal failure on an ammonia pump for the low temperature pump receiver. The mechanical seal failure was identified through the review of our process hazard analysis (PHA) for the Sand Lake facility's What-If Study. The failure scenario was identified under Subsystem #13-2.  Passive mitigation system was in place, the release took place inside the facility.

Housekeeping of the engine room area includes wiping up and investigating  oil leaks and moping the floors on a daily to weekly bases. \n\nThe second PHA recently performed for this facility produced no changes to improve safety. However the first PHA produced 17  recommendations to improve safety at the Sand Lake Road facility. Such changes included training, installation of new mitigation and/or controls, equipment and/or technology along with organizational changes."
