      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Four Star Fruit has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Four Star Fruit, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Four Star Fruit has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nWest Process                 Anhydrous Ammonia                71,000\nEast Process                 Anhydrous Ammonia                39,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n1. Prepared a unified prog"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n1.2.1 Facility Overview\n\nFour Star Fruit operates a commercial cold storage for table grapes in Delano, CA. The facility has two independent ammonia refrigeration systems that provide refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\nProcess 1 - West System\n(13) Rooms\n(6) Precools\n(3) Hallways\n(1) Shipping Dock\n(1) Repack Room\n(1) Glycol Room\n\nProcess 2 - East System\n(1) Room\n(3) Precools\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\nFour Star Fruit is located at 2800 Road 136 Delano, CA 93215. The latitude and longitude of the center of the facility is 35.839455, -119.264879. The facility is located on the west side of State Highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agricultural land.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is not located in a special flood hazard area.\nFour Star Fruit is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Four Star Fruit had a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Processes\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded and direct expansion operations.\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to each machinery room.\n\n1.2.4 Process Classificat"

      "SummaryText": "ion\n\nEach ammonia refrigeration system at Four Star Fruit consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. The systems are neither interconnected nor co-located relative to each other. As such, the refrigeration systems at Four Star Fruit are treated as two (2) independent processes.\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\nFour Star Fruit has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Four Star Fruit facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nFour Star Fruit has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\nFour Star Fruit's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following re"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFour Star Fruit has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Four Star Fruit continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Four Star Fruit's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Four Star Fruit's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nFour Star Fruit has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Four Star Fruit has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Four Star Fruit now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
