      "SummaryText": "Carolina Power & Light Company's (CP&L) Roxboro Steam Electric Plant is a coal-fired, electric power generating facility located in Semora, North Carolina. The plant uses ammonia in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to control nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. The SCR system is designed to inject ammonia gas into the plant flue gas and then pass the ammonia/flue gas mixture through a catalyst. The catalyst causes a reaction that reduces NOx (pollutant) in the flue gas, converting NOx into nitrogen gas and water. The Roxboro Plant stores the ammonia in two (2) 65,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks. The anhydrous ammonia in the storage tanks is liquefied under pressure. These tanks are limited to a maximum volume of 48,000 gallons by administrative controls. The Risk Management Plan addresses the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia used in the SCR system.\n\nRoxboro Plant has established an Accidental Release Prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with the regulatory requirements of both OSHA (Process Safety Management, PSM, 29CFR1910.119) and EPA (Risk Management Program, 40CFR68). In addition, for responding to emergencies the plant has an Integrated Emergency Response Plan that complies with all regulatory programs, including OSHA Emergency Response Planning requirements (29 CFR 1910.120(q)). The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nThe SCR system is newly constructed. There is no accident history. To further ensure a safe process, a Process Hazard Analysis was conducted. Opportunities to improve process safety were identified and implemented, including equipping the system with interlocks and excess flow valves and establishing emergency shutdown procedures. As well, the ammonia storage tanks were located in a dike designed to contain 110% of the entire inventory of a single tank. \n\nTo further comply with regulatory mandates, a worst-case release scenario and an alte"

      "SummaryText": "rnate scenario have been developed and modeled to comply with RMP regulations. The Process Hazard Analysis Software Tools (PHAST) program (a model accepted by the EPA) was used for the dispersion modeling.  The worst case scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The scenario used for this analysis was a tank rupture in which the total quantity in the tank is completely released over a 10-minute period.  This is extremely unlikely due to tank design and construction.  Notwithstanding, the model predicts a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.5 miles, which is based on a number of assumptions set forth by the EPA such as F class stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and the highest recorded temperature over the past three years, namely 105 degrees F.  Population information obtained through the \"EPA Geographic Query Information System (Version 97.1.8)\" show that approximately 1,000 people live within 1.5 miles of the storage tanks.  North Carolina Wildlife Game land is located within 1.5 miles of the storage tanks.\n\nThe alternate scenario was the case where a 2 inch transfer hose ruptures, releasing ammonia.  This scenario takes into account that excess flow valves will stop the flow of ammonia to the transfer hose, automatic emergency cable will automatically close an additional block valve if movement in the truck occurs, and breakaway couplings are designed to detach before a hose rupture, and the amount of ammonia released will equal the total volume of ammonia contained in the transfer hose.  This is extremely unlikely.  Notwithstanding, the model predicts a distance to toxic endpoint for this case to be 0.10 miles.   Population information obtained indicates there are no residences located within 0.10 miles of the storage tanks.  No environmental receptors were identified within 0.10 miles of the storage tanks.\n\nNote that"
