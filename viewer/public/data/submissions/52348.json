The Facility Policy \n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Tillman Producers Coop, Davidson Oklahoma are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n*Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application and for crop production nutrients.  \n*The maximum quantity stored  would be 79,000 pounds in our one-18,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nA.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 79,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.9 miles.\n\nB.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 cfr 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History\n\nA.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n*Have caused any deaths, in"

The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\nA.  A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\nB.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nC.  A written Emergency Response Program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training. \n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
