There is approximately 30,259 pounds of ammonia in the facility.  \n\n\n\nChelan Fruit Cooperative's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Chelan Fruit to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations. The prevention plan meets all the requirements of OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) regulations.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration personnel do not respond to large ammonia releases and have not received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1920.120. Actions to prevent a major release shall be attempted only by refrigeration personnel from an area that is not threatened by release.  Other employees will be evacuated or sheltered-in-place as appropriate. An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.  The plan has been reviewed with the local fire department.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\n\n?    Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n\n?    Reduce the threat to our personnel\n\n?    Reduce the threat to the community and environment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility has four 4 engine rooms, 29 CA rooms and 19 common storage rooms. The largest vessel has 9,345 pounds (80% of maximum capacity). Isolation valves are located throughout the facility with remote operation and shutdown capabilities. All engine rooms have outside kill switch"

The ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Piping and equipment is secured and protected, engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems used include:\n\n\n\n?    Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n\n?    Suction trap hi-level float\n\n?    High discharge pressure shut down\n\n?    Low suction pressure shut down\n\n?

Oil filters plugged shut down\n\n?    250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\n?    150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating procedures and checklists have been prepared by Chelan Fruit to be used by employees performing operational functions.  Procedures are kept in the refrigeration office.  These procedures include:\n\n\n\n?    Shut down procedures (routine and emergency)\n\n?    Pre-start up safety procedures\n\n?    Routine operations\n\n?    Maintenance of all equipment\n\n?    Response to major and minor releases\n\n?

At approximately 11:00 am on the 14th of August the fire was rapidly moving north due to strong winds.  C"

      "SummaryText": "helan County Fire Department, City of Chelan Fire Department and DNR teams were unable to control the fire and notified Chelan Fruit Co-Op they must evacuate the area immediately.  The instructions were passed down through Supervisors and all employees left the facility.  Refrigeration team members isolated the HPRs, as per ammonia safety training, and evacuated.  The fire destroyed 5 buildings and damaged administrative offices.  Approximately 62,000 lbs of ammonia was released during the fire from the 5 buildings.  There were no reports or incidents related to the loss of ammonia.  The strong winds, heat and high humidity allowed the ammonia to dissipate (and burn off) with no adverse consequences. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Chelan Fruit has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing training.  Chelan Fruit coordinates its response efforts with Chelan County Fire District 7, Washington State Patrol, Chelan County Sheriff and Chelan County Emergency Management.\n\n\n\nTraining on ammonia safety and detailed mechanical integrity will be a major ongoing process at Chelan Fruit.  Review and update of the emergency plan will be done annually and drills and emergency evacuation practices will be executed,also.  Training will be required for all employees who work around the ammonia system, including fork lift personnel.  "
