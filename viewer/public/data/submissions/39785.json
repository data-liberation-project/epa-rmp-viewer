These programs include both Dow Chemical\u00bfs Responsible Care\u00ae requirements and governmental requirements, such as the EPA\u00bfs RMP program and the CalARP RMP program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to employees, the public, and the environment.  Dow Chemical management is committed to providing appropriate training to employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe facility is located at 19500 Mariner Avenue in the City of Torrance, California.  The facility is known as the Torrance Distribution Terminal.  The activities conducted at the facility include the bulk storage, transfer and blending of chemicals.  Tank cars are temporarily stationed on-site for the unloading of bulk chemicals.  The Torrance terminal is recognized as a covered source under the RMP rule as the facility maintains quantities of a regulated substance above the threshold quantities listed in the RMP rule.  Currently, the only regulated substance present on-site in quantities above the threshold limit is vinyl acetate monomer (VAM).\n\nAnnual VAM throughput is approximately 43 million pounds.  VAM is received by tank rail cars and stored in one aboveground tank, Tank 26, dedicated for storage of VAM.  (In addition, VAM can also be received by tank truck, but there are currently no plans to use this mode of receipt.) Tank 26 is described below.\nInternal floating roof tank with double deck pontoon rim seals.\n265,000-gallon maximum capacity and 186,000-gallon operating capacity (using administrative controls);\nSecondary containment with a capacity of over 350,000 gallons; and\n Floating gauge for measuring liquid level.\nVAM is transferred via pipeline to the adjacent UCAR\u00ae Emulsion Systems (UES) latex manufacturing plan as needed or is shipped to customers"

      "SummaryText": "via tank trucks.  Trucks are vented to a scrubber during loading to control the release of vapors.  If VAM is loaded directly from rail cars to trucks, a dedicated vapor balance system is used to reduce emissions to the atmosphere.  At present, 100 percent of the Terminal\u00bfs VAM is transferred to the UCAR Emulsions Systems facility via pipeline, and there are no plans to resume shipment to customers by tank truck.\n\nA network of product transfer piping is routed between the VAM storage, the truck loading station and the adjacent UES latex plant.  All piping is coated to prevent corrosion and is supported by steel framework, or is securely fastened to concrete or asphalt platforms or foundations.  Underground sections of piping (two road crossings) are encased by an outer pipe to prevent corrosion due to contact with soils.\n\n HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  EPA defines alternative release scenarios as scenarios that are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  One or more alternative release scenarios are evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or active mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.\n\nThe zones of potential impact for the worst-case and alternative release were predicted using RMP*Comp\u00bf (Version 1.07) released by the EPA.  RMP*Comp\u00bf is an electronic tool to make the same calculations as performed manually by following the procedures described in EPA\u00bfs guidance document, RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (April, 1999).\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves derailment of"

The surface area of the resultant pool was estimated assuming a pool depth of 3 inches to reflect the reduction in horizontal extent of the pooled VAM due to percolation into the gravel.  The worst-case meteorological conditions defined by EPA for the worst-case release are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s) and a stability class of F (very stable).  The liquid is assumed to be at a temperature of 77oF.  The distance to the threshold concentration of 0.26 mg/l is 1.9 miles (3,100 meters).  Approximately 87,400 persons reside within the 1.9-mile impact radius.  \n\nThe catastrophic failure of a railcar while on a siding is a very low probability event.  Over the ten year period 1991-2000, there were on average only 72 serious incidents per year in the United States in which hazardous material was released from a railcar during an incident or accident (U.S. DOT, Hazardous Materials Safety, Hazardous Materials Information System, 1/23/02).  Most of these incidents involved derailments and other energetic events that have high potential for causing a release of hazardous material.  A slowly moving or static railcar on a siding is rarely exposed to the energetic forces required to produce a catastrophic breach of the rail car tank. \n\n[Note: The catastrophic failure of the VAM storage tank was evaluated as a potential for the worst-case release.  However, due to the presence of the secondary containment area, which limits the surface area of a spill, and consequently the emission rate, the zone of impact for this release scenario was not as large as the rail car failure described above.]\n\n Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe more likely alternative release scenario consists of a valve leak in the piping leading to Tank 26 caused by a stoppage of railcar unloading producing a liquid hammer that damages the valve.

Due to the fact that some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that are found during their work.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nDow Chemical encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained up-to-date by revising them as necessary. \n\nOperational Safety Program \n\nDow Chemical has a comprehensive program to ensure that all the elements listed within this accidental release prevention program are implemented at every Dow Chemical location. This Program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements. \n\nOperational Safety Standards \n\nDesign requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in operational safety standards. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\nDow Chemical conducts reviews just prior to startup to ensure that new and modified facilities and processes are safe for operation. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nDow conducted an internal audit of the Torrance Distribution Terminal in 2002.  A PHA was conducted during the audit using Dow\u00bfs proprietary \u00bfReactive Chemical Process Hazard Analysis\u00bf (RCPHA).  RCPHA Software version 4.0 (Revised 1/10/01) was used in the review.  The principal staff performing the RCPHA was Kevin Wees and Al Fedoruk.  \n\nThe RCPHA methodology consists of a checklist designed by Dow for use in internal reactive chemical and PHA audits.  Table 1 lists the major topic addressed in the RCPHA questionnaire.  For each question in the questionnaire, there are columns for a yes/no/not applicable response, a response column, columns to check the work discipline affected, and an action item column.  In"

      "SummaryText": "addition to the RCPHA questionnaire, there is a second questionnaire that is used for field validation to be used in conjunction with the RCPHA.\nThe RCPHA audit of the Torrance Terminal was performed on May 21-22, 2002.  This RCPHA audit is an update to the PHA/Hazard Operability Study (HazOp) performed for the original Risk Management Prevention Program (RMPP) plan and the current RMP prepared in 1999.  The RCPHA report is included in Appendix B.\n\nThere have been no significant changes to the VAM process at the Torrance Terminal since the preparation of the previous RMP and PHA.  While truck loading of VAM is not now occurring, the facility retains the equipment and the capability to distribute VAM via tank truck.  Currently, 100 percent of VAM at the terminal is received by railcar and is delivered by pipeline to the adjoining Dow UCAR Emulsions Systems facility. \n\nAs part of the RMP Update, the RCPHA developed during the May 2002 audit was reviewed by ENSR for completeness and applicability.   There were no significant findings identified during the RCPHA or during ENSR\u00bfs review of the RCPHA.  All action items established during the RCPHA audit have been assigned for follow-up by the Terminal Manager.\n\nTable 1\nDOW RCPHA Questionnaire Major Topic Headings\nSection      Subject                                                               Section       Subject\nA           General Information                                                 M   Control Systems/Computers\nB           Chemical Exposure Index (CEI)                                N    Environmental Controls and Waste Handling\nC           Fire and Explosion Index (FEI)                                 O    Backflow/Emergency Flow Blocks\nD           Higher Risk Reviews (HAZOPs and LOPA)                P    Chemical Storage and Handling and Utilities\nE           Additional Risk Evaluation                                       Q    Plant Drainage\nF           Reactive Chemicals Data"

After the review, ENSR conducted a walkthrough at the Terminal to confirm whether modifications recommended in the initial assessment and update had been completed.\n\nThe 1995 RMPP seismic assessment of the Terminal included the following areas: rail car offloading area, tanker truck loading area, vinyl acetate storage tank, and associated piping and pumps.  The supplemental seismic review was performed in 1999 to evaluate the Terminal according to the requirements in the 1998 Guidance for CalARP Seismic Assessment.\n\nBased on a review of the recommendations provided in the 1995 and 1999 seismic assessments, and a walkthrough of the facility, it appears that the recommended modifications have been adequately implemented.  No additional areas of concern were identified during ENSR's walkthrough.\nIn addition, the PHA is supplemented with an external events analysis that addresses additional possible mechanisms for system failure.
