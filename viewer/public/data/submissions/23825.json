Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Village of Palm Springs Robert L. Pratt Water Treatment Plant (Pratt WTP) is owned by the Village of Palm Springs.   The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency action plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases. The facility is currently developing and implementing a new and improved PSM program that will ensure the safety of its workers and the community.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe VIllage of Palm Srings Robert L. Pratt  WTP is a Water Treament facility located on 5618 Basil Drive, in West Palm Beach,  Palm Beach County, Florida.  The Pratt WTP adds chlorine in their chlorination process in order to disinfect  the City's water supply.\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to eight one-ton containers at the Chlorination process.  Two one-ton containers are always connected to the process with two on standby, while up to four additional containers are stored adjacent to the connected containers.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 16,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is totally enclosed in a building and protected from accidental releases by a chlorine scrubber.\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is the rupture of a one- ton container from the Chlorination process, releasing 2,000 lbs. of Chlorine gas over a ten minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions and considering the passive mitigation of the building, the chlorine gas could travel 0.7 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .0087 mg/L), using the WWTP Guidance lookup tables.\n\nThe Alternative Case Scenario chosen wa"

It was assumed that since the cyclinder was at the other end of the building that it could release for a time of 10 minutes before the  chlorine detectors or scrubber would kick in and start the active mitigation of the chlorine.  This would result in approximately 839 pounds of chlorine released with an estimated mitigated release rate of 23.8 lb/min inside the building for ten minutes and an endpoint distance of 0.1 miles, using the WWTP Guidance loolup tables.  \n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Pratt Water Plant Chlorination process in the Program 3 level.  The Pratt WTP facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Village of Palm Springs Pratt Water Treatment Plant is currently developing a program to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes written operating procedures for the chlorination process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the chlorination process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  The PSM Program also includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all chlorination equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Safe work practices, such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, have long been required by the Village of Palm Springs Utilities Operations Department.  These were reviewed and "

      "SummaryText": "updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the collection and review of all equipment information, including the development of Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all chlorination industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  The staff also performed a Process Hazard Analysis of the process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation have also been incorporated into this program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Village of Palm Springs Pratt Water Treatment facility has had one accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years, however, it did not cause any offsite injury or harm as defined in the RMP regulation.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Village of Palm Springs Pratt Water Plant has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  The facility will rely on outsite responders to respond to a chlorine accidental release.  The site has very limited internal emergency response capability and has a procedure to address small releases of chlorine.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Palm Beach County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519."
