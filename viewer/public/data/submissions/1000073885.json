The plan has been prepared in accordance with the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule 40 CFR Part 68. RMP requires facilities that use extremely hazardous substances to develop a Risk Management Plan. These plans must be revised and resubmitted to EPA every five years. \r\n\r\nThe Amvac facility was originally a portion of the Dupont Manufacturing Center (Now FMC). It was purchased from Dupont by Amvac on 5-18-2001. Amvac is considered a tenant on the FMC (formerly Dupont) site at Axis Alabama. All site Emergency Response is mutually shared and coordinated by the emergency response teams from both companies. \r\n\r\nAmvac's Axis facility receives steam, fire water, process water, potable water and air from the FMC (formerly Dupont) facility. Amvac's facility consists of various buildings, chemical reactors, above ground storage tanks and vessels (inside containment), truck loading/unloading stations, railcar unloading stations and various ancillary equipment. \r\n\r\nThe Amvac Axis facility has a North American industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 32532 for Pesticide and Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing. The plant manufactures pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials in quantities which make them subject to the Risk Management Rule requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68).\r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.190 outlines requirements for submitting updates to the RMP. Amvac's most recent submittal was certified and sent to EPA on February 21, 2017. Amvac's 5 Year Anniversary date is currently February 21, 2022. This is the date by which the next full RMP re-submission must be completed. \r\n\r\nThe listed Toxic substances include:\r\n1.\tChlorine; CAS# 7782-50-5 used in Fortress (chlorethoxyfos) and DMCAA processes\r\n2.\tPhosphorus Trichloride; CAS# 7719-12-2 used in Fortress (chlorethoxyfos), K500 and Phosphite processes\r\n3.\tHydroge"

As per 40 CFR 68.22 (c) and because AMVAC uses the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance through RMP*Comp, AMVAC has evaluated the worst case release analyses with RMP*Comp assumptions of 25 degrees C and 50% humidity as values for the temperature and humidity variables. Per 40 CFR 68.22(g), the highest maximum temperature at Mobile regional Airport since 2015 was used for the temperature of the released substance.  That temperature occurred on July 19, 2015, with a reading of 98 degrees F. This information was obtained from Corey Bunn, Meteorologist at Coastal Weather Research Center, Mobile Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe one worst case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance to an endpoint for toxicity is from the release of carbon disulfide. Assumptions for this scenario include a complete release of the contents of the carbon disulfide (CS2) storage tank (V303). Carbon Disulfide is loaded from iso-containers and railcars into V303. \r\n\r\nRMP*Comp input parameters for worst case scenario modeling include 315,000 pounds of carbon disulfide released into its surrounding concrete dike of 6,080 square feet and 2.5 ft. wall, and maximum temperature of 98 degrees F. The resulting distance in any direction to an endpoint was calculated to be 5.0 miles. This distance is at least a half-mile further to a toxic endpoint than any other RMP-regulated chemical.\r\n\r\nAn e"

      "SummaryText": "vent of this nature is very unlikely due to process controls described in this report. There are several safeguards in place to prevent a scenario such as this. Level alarms associated with the carbon disulfide storage tank will alarm on high level and will automatically close valves in the unload line. The unload pump will shut down on low flow (dry run protection) and loss of instrument air, electricity or nitrogen will also result in shutdown of unloading operations.  Temperature indicators will alarm if high temperature boundaries are met. Area monitors are present to detect vapor release, and they will activate alarms located in the control room. Vapors are routed through a scrubber and then to a vent gas incinerator for emission control. As an additional measure, operators maintain 3 - 4 inches of water in the V303 containment dike. Since carbon disulfide is heavier than water, this ensures that any leaks of carbon disulfide will be submersed in water to minimize vaporization.\r\n\r\nAn alternate release scenario for carbon disulfide (CS2) is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. This would be a leak that develops in the CS2 transfer line from the storage tank to the reactor. It takes approximately 50 minutes to transfer CS2 into the reactor. Assuming a leak rate of 4 gallons per minute and 50 minutes release time, this leak would result in 200 gallons of carbon disulfide spilling onto the concrete floor. RMP*Comp dispersion model was used for this alternative scenario. A total of 200 gallons (2,080 pounds) of carbon disulfide were released, and the estimated downwind distance to the toxic endpoint was 0.2 miles. There are no public receptors within this area.\r\n\r\nThe 104,000-pound bromine storage tank (V126) is surrounded by a concrete dike size of 300 square feet, with 4-foot walls, and is equipped with a high-level alarm and reductant shut-down systems that will automatically shut off supply of bromine to ensure that the level is maintai"

The chlorine delivery system is equipped with automatic emergency shut-off devices actuated by a signal from dedicated local chlorine sensors. The system also includes a shut-off valve in the chlorine line to the reactor which will not open unless the upstream pressure is greater than the downstream pressure (backflow prevention). Rupture discs are provided to prevent piping from rupture due to hydrostatic pressure buildup between blocked valves.\r\n\r\nThe alternate scenario for a chlorine release is a process pipe leak from failure at the load flange, resulting in 150 pounds of chlorine released to atmosphere. Typical charging time is about 200 minutes (0.75 pounds per minute). According to RMP*Comp, an estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is less than 0.1 miles. There are no alternate scenarios having toxic endpoints offsite. \r\n\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario and Alternative Case Scenario for covered Flammable Substances:\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternate Case scenario for Flammable Substances are presented for Methylamine (CAS#74-89-5), which is classified as a flammable substance in Table 3 of 40 CFR 68 and is used as a raw material in the Metam/Kpam process. Methylamine (MMA) is offloaded from railcars, in gaseous state into storage tanks V301 and V302, which have been pre-charged with water. The capacity of the railcar is 160,000 pounds of anhydrous MMA. The MMA storage tanks are located within a concrete dike for containment. The worst case scenario would be a complete release of the contents of the railcar. Using RMP*Comp, an estimate of 160,000 pounds (vapor cloud explosion) with wind speed of 1.5 m/s and stability class G, @ 77F (25C), resulted in an estimated impact distance of 0.4 miles. The wind speed, temperature and stability class are assumptions used by RMP*Comp. \r\n\r\nAn"
