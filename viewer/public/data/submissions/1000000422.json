ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\n\n      THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD  BE 270,000 \n      POUNDS. THIS INCLUDES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT COULD BE STORED IN NURSE TANKS.\n\n3.   THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n      \n     This facility has developed a worst-case release and a alternative-case \n     release scenario.
