      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE PUEBLO WEST WTP AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n \n\nUnited Sates Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations, promulgated on June 20, 1996 under the Clean Air Act, require facilities that have a regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal Risk Management Program (RMProgram) and to register and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan). The RMP rule regulates 140 chemical for their toxic or flammable characteristics. Of the chemicals regulated, one or more of the following typically triggers RMP requirements at water treatment plants (threshold quantities noted in parentheses): Chlorine (2,500 pounds); anhydrous ammonia (10,000 pounds); aqueous ammonia (20,000 pounds); and chlorine dioxide, (1,000 pounds). If any of these chemicals are handled stored, or used above the threshold quantity, the water treatment plant (WTP) is subject to the RMP rule. Pueblo West WTP uses chlorine above the 2,500 lb. threshold quantity and therefore must prepare a RMProgram.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine room is equipped to store six, one-ton containers. Four chlorine cylinders are on scales and hooked up to feed chlorine. The remaining two cylinders are full and or empty and are never hooked up to feed chlorine in these positions.Most of the time there are six cylinders in the room. Thus, the maximum chlorine inventory is 12,000 lbs. The four Cylinders on the scales are each equipped with regulators,and heated drip legs.Each ton container is connected to an automatic switch over valve that is incorporated in the regulator unit on the cylinders.\n\n\n\nBelow is a brief summary of the Pueblo West WTP Risk Management Program.\n\n \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the RMP rule is to lesson the number of serious chemical accidents that could affect public health and the environment, and also to improve the response to those accidents that do oc"

Operators and management at the Pueblo West WTP have several measures already in place, and have initiated other measures as well, to minimize the likelihood of an accidental chlorine release. In fact, to date there has not been any accidental chlorine releases at the facility since the building was constructed in 1994.\n\n\n\nAll operators at the WTP are trained in operating the chlorine process, and follow all appropriate safety procedures. Both management and staff are committed to ensuring safety at the WTP. Training and safety meetings are held on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Pueblo West facility follows all recommended safety, design, and operational and maintenance guidelines developed by the Chlorine Institute. In addition, refresher training is routinely conducted.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine containers are stored in an enclosed building that meets 1994 Uniform Fire Code requirements, including the installation of a 1-ton chlorine scrubber. The scrubber is connected to the chlorine room by a vent through the wall, which has an intake approximately 8-inches off the floor. The scrubber is activated upon alarm from the chlorine monitor. The four chlorine cylinders that are set up to feed chlorine are equipped with automatic valves that shut off the chlorine cylinder valves when the chlorine gas detection system is activated. The chlorine room also has a sprinkler system. A control panel, located in the adjacent filter room, contains the chlorine monitor, exhaust fan control, lighting control and scrubber control.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nFor Pueblo West WTP's chlorine process, the worse case release quantity is 2,000 Ibs., i.e. the capacity of a 1- ton container. As defined by the RMP rule, the worst-case release scenario for toxic gases (such as chlorine) to be modeled is\n\n\n\n\"For regulated toxic substances that are no"

      "SummaryText": "rmally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the owner or operator shall assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe, is released as a gas over 10 minutes. The release rate shall be assumed to be the total quantity divided by 10 unless passive mitigation systems are in place.\"\n\n\n\nTherefore, the worst-case release rate for chlorine at Pueblo West is 200 Ibs. Per minute. Although, the chlorine vessels are kept indoors, based on recommendations made in RMP guidance manuals, passive mitigation from the building was not included in the worst-case release scenario because the cylinders are unloaded outside the building upon delivery to the site and therefore the cylinders are some times outdoors. As required, the worst-case scenario release was assumed to take place at ground level. The toxic endpoint for chlorine for modeling the worst-case release is 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm). Note, that a guidance manual (versus a site-specific model) was used to estimate the chlorine release distance to toxic endpoint and therefore the estimated release distance of 3.07 miles is considered to be a very conservative number.\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios are intended to reflect more likely releases than the worst-case release scenario. Program 2 facilities, such as Pueblo West WTP, are required to evaluate and present at least one alternative release scenario. For alternative release scenarios, both active and passive mitigation systems can be taken into consideration. In this analysis, the chlorine scrubber at the Pueblo West WTP was included. For the alternative-release scenario, failure of the 1/2-inch piping connected to two 1-ton containers was considered. From the \"Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants\" manual, the chlorine release rate from this scenario would be limited by the flow through the 5/16-inch valve openings at the chlorine containers rather than the flow through a 1/2-inch pipe.

      "SummaryText": "rate of release would be 23.4 Ibs/minute. The maximum duration of release was assumed to be 60 minutes. This duration was selected because of the close proximity that the fire department is to the WTP. The total chlorine release from this scenario is 1,404 Ibs. Because the plant has a scrubber, with a 2,000 Ib capacity, the release to the environment is anticipated to be minimal and is not anticipated to migrate beyond the boundary of the site. Thus, for our alternative release scenario, there is no estimated off-site distance to toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nPueblo West WTP has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nPueblo West WTP has chosen to rely on local community emergency responders. In the event of a chlorine accident, a staff person will call 911, and the fire department will respond to the accident. The fire department is located in close proximity to the WTP and will be able to be on site within minutes of a call.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe primary changes that have been made as a result of implementing a RMProgram are greater staff and management awareness and commitment to safety."
