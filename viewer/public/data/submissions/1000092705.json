The Crude Loading Facility loads rail cars through one loading rack, and the NGL Loading Facility loads natural gas liquid (NGL), propane and butane through another loading rack. Only the NGL Loading Facility is OSHA PSM covered and contains materials covered in the EPA RMP list of flammables.\r\nThe TRT Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Loading Facility identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, Inc., of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the BakerRisk's SafeSite 3G computer code and the Baker-Strehlow-Tang (BST) methodology for determining the RMP worst case scenario, which is the 1 psig overpressure contour. According to the analyses, the greatest maximum end point for a 1 psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 360 feet (0.07 miles) from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained in one rail car filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of total car volume, 153,000 pounds) with butane. This worst-case release would not affect any public or environmental receptor. \r\nWithin the past five years, the Tioga Rail Terminal (the NGL Loading Facility initiated operation in July 2014) has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. \r\nIn the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, Tioga Rail Terminal has Emergency Response Plan in place and the facility personnel have been trained in emergency response. It is our company policy to notify the 911 and/or Tioga Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency. Entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the loca"

Therefore, the local volunteer fire department and other emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.\r\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\r\nJody Schroeder\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Tioga Rail Terminal, which is owned and operated by Hess North Dakota Export Logistics, LLC, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the investment of significant resources in accident prevention, such as personnel training, mechanical inspection, process control systems and by recognition of safety as a primary factor in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. However, if an accidental release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release if safe to do so.\r\nTo prevent accidental releases, the Tioga Rail Terminal achieves control of hazardous materials by:\r\n1) A commitment to OSHA's Process Safety Management and HAZWOPER standards, EPA's Risk Management Plan, and the Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Transportation Act regulations which promote and require adherence to process safety activities designed to prevent accidental releases.\r\n2) Development and use of the parent company Hess Corporation and the Tioga Rail Terminal safety, operating, maintenance, emergency response, engineering design and construction policies, procedures and practices designed to prevent accidents and potential releases.\r\n3) Knowledge of and adherence to applicable industry recognized standards and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP), specifications and recommended practices that address and provide guidance for the proper design, construction, operation and mai"

The Crude Loading Facility loads rail cars through one loading rack, and the NGL Loading Facility loads natural gas liquid (NGL), propane and butane through another loading rack. Only the NGL Loading Facility is OSHA PSM covered and contains materials covered in the EPA RMP list of flammables.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nProcesses at the Tioga Rail Terminal  that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The Tioga Rail Terminal  adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nWithin the past five years, the Tioga Rail Terminal  has had no accidental release that caused off-site impacts as defined by the EPA Risk Management Program rule 40 CFR 68.10(b)(1). Within the past 5 years the Facility has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damages, public evacuations or sheltering in-place.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nThe Tioga Rail Terminal  maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety, and the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of regulated substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is involved. The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address mainten"
