This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Athens Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n2) A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled. Steelcase Inc, is a manufacturer of metal office furniture. Propane gas is used as a standby fuel in the event that our natural gas is curtailed or shutoff.  Propane is received by truck and stored in four 30,000-gallon storage tanks. The maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this plant is 443,520 pounds. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n3)  Worst-Case Release Scenario.  The worst-case release scenario is failure of one of the 30,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 600F) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The event would release 110,880 pounds of propane. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a vapor and finds an ignition source. Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion. The distance to the 1-psi endpoint is calculated to be 0.39 miles. The affected population is estimated to be 24 people. \n\nAlternate Release Scenario. The alternative release scenario involves a safety relief valve that lifts due to an overpressure. The resulting vapor is assumed to reach an ignition source. Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion. The distance to the 1-psi endpoint is calculated to be 0.0"

This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58.  The Alabama Liquefied Petroleum Gas Board has inspected this facility.\n\n\n5) Five-year accident history. Steelcase has had no accidents involving propane in the last 5 years that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6) The emergency response program.  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Athens Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department. Representatives of the Athens Fire Department have inspected this facility and are familiar with the LP Gas Standby Fuel System and our response program.\n\n\n7) Planned changes to improve safety.
