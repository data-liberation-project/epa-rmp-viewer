      "SummaryText": "Manuel del Valle, Inc. has established strict procedures and guidelines to prevent releases of chemicals from covered processes in relation to the accidental release program requirements set forth by the USEPA.\n\nThese procedures and guidelines are overseed by management and communicated to employees through the implementation of both classroom and on-the-job training sessions. Adherence to release prevention policies is ascertained by the execution of external audits performed by outside consultants. Whenever non-compliances are detected, or whenever a hazard analysis points out to defficiencies, Manuel del Valle, Inc. will undertake every possible effort, in the shortest time feasible to address those items and upgrade our programs and/or practices.\n\nAlso, engineering works have been designed and built into our facility to provide adequate mitigation in case of an accidental release.\n\nIn regards to emergency response policies, Manuel del Valle, Inc. has developed contingency and emergency response plans in accordance with relevant regulatory guidelines. Also, Manuel del Valle, Inc. maintains close communications and relations with local and state emergency response agencies to aid in fast response and mitigation, if ever needed. Furthermore, Manuel del Valle, Inc. maintains agreements with private emergency response contractors that have been incorporated as part of our ER plans.\n\nManuel del Valle, Inc. understands the risks involved in the handling of regulated chemicals in certain processes and has always been willing to comply with all applicable regulations to the best of our capacity."
