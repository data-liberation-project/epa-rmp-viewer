Senior management is committed to protecting the health of its employees and the general public and is actively developing comprehensive safety management plans to achieve these objectives.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDODGE manages the facility in compliance with Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA),\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), and United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) regulations. Senior management at the facility is designated as having primary responsibility for ensuring compliance to these programs.\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDODGE provides embalming chemicals for mortuary services. The warehouse stores formaldehyde containing products prior to shipment to clients.  No manufacturing or re-bottling is done onsite. The warehouse facility in Batavia, IL includes a warehouse and administrative area.  DODGE operates one process that stores formaldehyde containing solutions: warehouse storage \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDODGE has put in place several measures that serve to prevent/mitigate the release of liquid formaldehyde\n\nin the warehouse and shipping areas. These include:\n\n- Fire extinguishers are located throughout the warehouse areas and personnel that work in this area have been trained on their proper use.\n\n- Personal protection equipment and spill kits are located throughout the warehouse area and personnel that work in this area have been trained on their proper use.\n\n - Warehouse workers are trained in the proper handling of materials, including forklift operation.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of formaldehyde at the Dodge Company since it began operations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDODGE conducted a process hazards analysis (PHA) for the formaldehyde process "
