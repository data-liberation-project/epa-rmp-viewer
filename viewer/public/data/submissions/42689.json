      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nIdeal Chemical and Supply Company, Inc.,  is a distributor of industrial and commercial chemicals.  The Bossier City facility is constructed on property leased at 3848 Industrial Circle in Bossier City, Bossier Parish, Louisiana.\n\nIdeal Chemical & Supply Co. is committed to The Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  This process recognizes the need for industry to meet or exceed legal requirements for the responsible management of chemicals and chemical industry practices in achieving the collective objectives of improved health, safety, and environmental performance.\n\nThe following describes just a few of the programs that have been implemented at Ideal to improve operations and reduce risks:\n\n1.  Risk Management:  Chemical safety management affects both employees and customers.  Through evaluation and planning Ideal strives to reduce the risks associated with handling chemicals throughout their lifecycle.\n\n2.  Compliance Review and Training:  Regulations are constantly changing, and staying current is the first step of the challenge.  Ideal makes the difference by implementing programs for compliance and sharing information upon request.\n\n3.  Carrier Selection:  Safe transportation of chemicals is essential in responsible distribution.  Our drivers are fully trained, our trucks properly maintained, and our products contained and secured.  We routinely audit our outside carriers to verify that they also meet the same safety requirements.\n\n4.  Handling and Storage:  Proper handling and stroage includes facility design, loading and unloading, maintenance and cleaning.  Understanding the latest information on chemical hazards safeguards against exposures, prevents accidents and reduces emissions.\n\n5.  Job Procedures and Training:  Written operating procedures, along with job descriptions that include minimum skill requirements, standardize our operation.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan:  Systematic emergency "

      "SummaryText": "response requires consistent planning, both internally and in cooperation with outside agencies.  Installation of containment systems, emergency drills, communication and facility tours are a few of the steps Ideal has taken.\n\n7.  Community Outreach:  Ideal is dedicated to interacting with the community on issures related to responsible chemical distribution.  We work with government agencies to support public policies and regulations that address community concerns.\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nThe only chemical handled by Ideal that is subject to the Risk Managment Program is chlorine.  Chlorine is handled in 150 lb. cylinders. \n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, Ideal has investigated possible accident scenarios using the U.S. EPA approved RMP*Comp model to evaluate potential offsite impacts.  Ideal believes that the most resonable accident scenario involving chlorine could impact an area with a radius of O.1 mile from the facility.  This scenario involves the leaking of chlorine from a cylinder.\n\nIdeal is subject to the Process Safety Management rules of OSHA.  Ideal is constantly evaluating its safety programs for improvement."
