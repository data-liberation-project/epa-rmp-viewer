In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The Dannon Company facility is located at 216 Southgate Drive, Minster, Ohio. We manufacture some of the finest cultured dairy products (yogurt) in the world. The facility covers approximately 300,000 square feet and includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. Also located at the facility, a raw milk processing plant, shipping and receiving docks. \n\nThe facility produces and ships approximately 560 million pounds of finished product each year.  The refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains in excess of 17,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Dannon Company has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because"

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\nThe Dannon Company has developed and implemented A Process Safety Management Program and has organized the information and polices pertaining to the process into a complete library. \n\nVolume 1 of the PSM/RMP Library incorporates several policies. Many policies are included in Volume 1, the remaining are referenced from other training manuals maintained in the facility.\n\nEmployee Participation Guidelines: This policy outlines the commitment between management and employees to establish a program for a successful (safe) program.\n\nProcess Safety Information: This includes information on the ammonia inventory at the facility, applicable codes, design standards, and information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia (referenced from the IIAR ammonia Data Book).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Program: This program outlines a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards within a process involving potentially hazardous chemicals such as ammonia.\n\nOperating Procedures: develop, implement, and maintain clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules, and practices for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration process during all operating phases. The operating procedures provide all employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration process with the written information and precautions necessary to safety perform their tasks in a consistent manner.\n\nContractor Qualification Guidelines: This guideline has been established to verify that the contractors working in the facility are qualified to work on the system, trained in the hazards associated with their work, and made aware of the hazards presented by the facility to the employees of t"

The purpose of an MI program is to maintain process equipment so that a catastrophic release of ammonia is avoided or properly contained. The emphasis should be on preventive maintenance rather than breakdown maintenance.\n\nMany more specific programs and policies (Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout / Tagout, Employee training, etc..) have been developed. For information specific to these see the Risk and Reliability Manager.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Re-validation was completed in September 2010..  The PHA highlighted some deficiencies in the system. These items were addressed as part of the continuous improvement of the facility. These items were addressed on the basis of priority (Injuries to personnel).
