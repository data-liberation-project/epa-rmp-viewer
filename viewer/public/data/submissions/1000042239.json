Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning safety and accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

[DCPC] is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program encompasses areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  We implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nDCPC is a leading manufacturer of aerosol propellants and refrigerant gases.  The facility receives chemicals in tank trucks and rail cars that are offloaded into various storage tanks.  The chemicals are processed through molecular sieve columns and mercury removal units, if necessary, to higher purity levels and specifications.  Chemicals may be metered and blended to customer specifications, if required.  Outbound shipments may be made via tank trucks or rail cars.\r\n\r\nThe following 5 regulated [flammables] chemicals are present at the Sparta facility: \r\nPropane, n-Butane, Isobutane, Difluoroethane and Dimethyl Ether [aka Methyl Ether].  \r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nDCPC maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the plant, DCPC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nDCPC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nDCPC conducts maintenance checks on process equipment which includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified and trained personnel.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training, as needed.  Deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at DCPC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications are conducted routinely at DCPC.
