GLNRP has installed a cryogenic gas processing plant at the Chalmette Refinery, an eighty mile long 10\" pipeline from Chalmette to Geismar, LA and a fractionation facility in Geismar.  Total investment for the three components was $115,000,000.  Present personnel complement is 26 for the operations and maintenance activities.  Future growth plans include a cryogenic gas processing plant at the Motiva Enterprises, LLC, Convent Refinery and an Refinery Grade Propylene Splitter system at the Geismar Fractionation Facility.\n\nThe Chalmette Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant receives Chalmette Refining's off-gas in two streams.  The first is saturated off-gas and the second is unsaturated off-gas.  These gas streams are processed through compression and low temperature separation to extract natural gas liquids (NGL's).  The natural gas liquids are then pumped into a transmission pipeline to Gulf Liquids New River Project, LLC's Fractionation Plant in Geismar, LA.  The Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant returns residual gas and hydrogen to the Chalmette Refinery.  This facility also receives a hydrocarbon liquid consisting of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and/or commercial butane.  This small hydrocarbon liquid stream is pumped directly into the product pipeline to the Geismar Fractionation Plant.  The product is stored in a small 15,000 gallon product surge tank prior to injection into the transmission pipeline.\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario to be reported is the scenario of the release of the entire product s"

This was chosen as the worst case scenario because the product surge tank is the largest single vessel which contains the flammable product under pressure.\n\nThe flammable alternate case scenario to be reported is that of a rupture of a 2\" LPG (propane) truck unloading hose at the truck unloading area near the South property line of the facility.  This alternate (or more likely) case scenario was chosen because of its proximity to the property line and the fact that if it should occur, the consequence would have very limited offsite impact.\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility.\n\nGulf Liquids New River Project, LLC has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accidental releases of flammable materials to the environment.  This policy is supported by many programs such as, the compliance with OSHA's 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification and retraining program with written operating procedures.  Since the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, it qualifies as a Program 3 facility under the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation.\n\nThe facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation in safety reviews and an equipment mechanical integrity inspection program for all major equipment items and piping systems, as well as, new equipment purchases.  The facility operations personnel also issue Hot Work Permits and Safe Work Permits for maintenance activities within the operating units.\n\nThe facility also conducts the following safety inspections on the basis as noted:\n\n1. Work areas - as needed.\n2. Portable fire extinguishers"

Yards, parking lots, roofs, etc. - annually.\n\nCompliance audits will bee conducted every three (3) years as required by OSHA's CFR 1910.119 regulation.  In addition, incident investigations will be conducted immediately after any accidental release or incident occurs.  The cause of the incident will be determined and appropriate steps are taken to prevent recurrence of the event.\n\nThe facility also has an emergency action plan in the event of a release of a flammable material.  The following provide support for the plant in the event of a fire:\n\n1. St. Bernard Fire Department.\n2. Orleans Parish Fire Department.\n3. Chalmette Refinery fire brigade.\n\nThe facility engineering staff also follows and adheres to guidelines set forth in American Petroleum Institute (API) standards and recommended practices, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes for fire protection systems, National Boiler Inspection Codes (NBIC) for fired boilers, the American Society Of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel and piping codes, and the National Electric Codes for flammable environments.\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternate case release scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release as defined by the RMP regulation is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the product surge tank (at the 100% level) with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion as the flammable vapor cloud finds an ignition source.  This worst case scenario was chosen because the product surge tank is the single largest vessel which contains a flammable liquid under pressure.\n\nFor the alternate release scenario, the facility has chosen the rupture and subsequent vapor cloud explosion of a 2\" hose at the propane unloading station for the alternate case scenario.  This choice was made since the propane unloading station is located near the South property line of the facility and the consequence of this scena"

The process units and storage tanks have been inspected as necessary prior to the introduction of hydrocarbons into the facility.  During the month of April 2000, the facility staff performed a thorough safety analysis of each skid using the HAZOP methodology.\n\nSince the facility is an OSHA covered facility, the various skids have undergone the initial Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  The initial PHAs and subsequent safety analyses included employee participation at the unit operator level.\n\nThe facility has a policy of periodic mechanical integrity inspections, depending on the type of equipment.  The safety relief valves that protect vessels, tanks and piping systems, are integral parts of this program.  The last mechanical integrity inspection of the product storage tank was conducted in the fabrication shop.\n\n\nThe five year accident history.\n\nThe Chalmette Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant is a new facility, and , hence, there is no five year accident history.\n\nThe emergency action plan.\n\nThe Chalmette Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

      "SummaryText": "plant at the Motiva Enterprises, LLC, Convent Refinery and an Refinery Grade Propylene Splitter system at the Geismar Fractionation Facility.\n\n\n\nThe Chalmette Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant receives Chalmette Refining's off-gas in two streams.  The first is saturated off-gas and the second is unsaturated off-gas.  These gas streams are processed through compression and low temperature separation to extract natural gas liquids (NGL's).  The natural gas liquids are then pumped into a transmission pipeline to Gulf Liquids New River Project, LLC's Fractionation Plant in Geismar, LA.  The Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant returns residual gas and hydrogen to the Chalmette Refinery.  This facility also receives a hydrocarbon liquid consisting of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and/or commercial butane.  This small hydrocarbon liquid stream is pumped directly into the product pipeline to the Geismar Fractionation Plant.  The product is stored in a small 15,000 gallon product surge tank prior to injection into the transmission pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario to be reported is the scenario of the release of the entire product surge tank contents (at 100% level) and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion at or near the product surge vessel.  This was chosen as the worst case scenario because the product surge tank is the largest single vessel which contains the flammable product under pressure.\n\n\n\nThe flammable alternate case scenario to be reported is that of a rupture of a 2\" LPG (propane) truck unloading hose at the truck unloading area near the South property line of the facility.  This alternate (or more likely) case scenario was chosen because of its proximity to the property line and the fact that if it should occur, the consequence would have very limited offsite impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility.\n\n\n\nGulf Liquids New River Project, LLC has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accide"

This policy is supported by many programs such as, the compliance with OSHA's 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification and retraining program with written operating procedures.  Since the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, it qualifies as a Program 3 facility under the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation.\n\n\n\nThe facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation in safety reviews and an equipment mechanical integrity inspection program for all major equipment items and piping systems, as well as, new equipment purchases.  The facility operations personnel also issue Hot Work Permits and Safe Work Permits for maintenance activities within the operating units.\n\n\n\nThe facility also conducts the following safety inspections on the basis as noted:\n\n\n\n1. Work areas - as needed.\n\n2. Portable fire extinguishers - monthly.\n\n3. Pressure vessels - as specified in API \n\n4. Extension cords, motorized hand-tools - every 3 months.\n\n5. Yards, parking lots, roofs, etc. - annually.\n\n\n\nCompliance audits will bee conducted every three (3) years as required by OSHA's CFR 1910.119 regulation.  In addition, incident investigations will be conducted immediately after any accidental release or incident occurs.  The cause of the incident will be determined and appropriate steps are taken to prevent recurrence of the event.\n\n\n\nThe facility also has an emergency action plan in the event of a release of a flammable material.

This worst case scenario was chosen because the product surge tank is the single largest vessel which contains a flammable liquid under pressure.\n\n\n\nFor the alternate release scenario, the facility has chosen the rupture and subsequent vapor cloud explosion of a 2\" hose at the propane unloading station for the alternate case scenario.  This choice was made since the propane unloading station is located near the South property line of the facility and the consequence of this scenario would have a minor offsite impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nGulf Liquids New River Project, LLC has implemented numerous procedures to ensure the safety and well being of its employees and the general environment surrounding the facility.
