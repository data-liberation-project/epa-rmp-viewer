The MAWC South Water Treatment Plant, located near the Meramec River in Sunset Hills, serves customers in South and Southwest St. Louis County, and has the capacity to produce 40 million gallons of drinking water per day.  Chlorine, a disinfectant used in the water treatment process, is covered under OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  MAWC complies with these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that the risks involved in the handling, use and storage of chlorine are minimized.  It is MAWC\u00c2\u00bfs policy to conduct our business in accordance with applicable environmental, safety and health laws and regulations.  Management fully supports efforts to safely manage process risks to prevent incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment.  In conducting our business, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.  We promote continuous improvement through business planning, ongoing training, and constant oversight of operations.  We take safety seriously and have comprehensive accident prevention and emergency planning and response programs in place.  MAWC\u00c2\u00bfs Environmental Policy emphasizes \u00c2\u00bfcontinuous improvement of our environmental performance\u00c2\u00bf while providing our services in a manner that prevents pollution and promotes sustainability.  As part of this policy MAWC has implemented an Environmental Management System at the South Water Treatment Plant to help minimize the Plant\u00c2\u00bfs impacts on the environment and to improve the Plant\u00c2\u00bfs overall environmental performance.\n\nCHLORINE SYSTEM\n\nChlorine is used to purify drinking water.  It is an important chemical that disinfects against disease producing organisms, and is used in the treatment of 98% of U.S. drinking water.  Missour"

We continue to operate well within the guidelines set by EPA and other regulatory authorities.  Due to the hazards of chlorine, however, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in order to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure.\n\nTo further reduce the potential of off-site releases, the South Plant has converted to the on-site generation of chlorine by hyprochlorite system. There is currently on four (4) tons of chlorine on-site.  The one ton cylinders will remain on-site thru the summer to ensure the new hypochlorite sytem functions during the high demands  of the summer.  If the new systems works as designed, all chlorine will be removed from the facility and wwill delist our RMP program at that time.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMissouri American Water Company (MAWC) has a comprehensive prevention program in place, which ensures safe operation of the system and prevention of accidental releases.  The chlorine system at the plant is designed for safety.  We follow Chlorine Institute Standards and use only equipment and materials certified for chlorine service.  Excess flow, remote isolation, and safety relief valves, as well as a vacuum system, are utilized to prevent leaks.  A process hazard analysis is performed and reviewed regularly to identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with the chlorine system.  Procedures and systems are in place to operate safely.  Comprehensive operating procedures provide clear instructions for safe operation of the chlorine system.  Process safety information is available to all employees and includes information related to chlorine hazards, such as Material Safety Data Sheets, process technology, and process equipment.   Operators are formally trained to operate the chlorine process safely, and receive classroom as well as on-the-job instruction.  Procedures are"

The facility is staffed 24 hours per day and the process is continuously monitored using state-of-the-art computerized instrumentation and operator oversight.  Environmental and safety audits are conducted regularly, and corrective action follow-up is performed.  A preventive and corrective maintenance program ensures the mechanical integrity of the chlorine system, and includes procedures for equipment inspection, testing and repair.  Employees receive specialized training to perform chlorine system maintenance.  A contractor safety program is in place to ensure contractors are qualified and trained to safely work on the chlorine process.  Employees and contractors must also adhere to established safe work practices and permit requirements whenever work is performed on or near the chlorine process.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Missouri American Water Company South Water Treatment Plant experienced a chlorine release on September 3, 2002.  The release resulted in a loss of approximately 0.1 pounds of chlorine to the environment (air).  There were no off-site injuries or property damage, however one employee was sent to the company doctor for treatment of \u00c2\u00bfasthma\u00c2\u00bf like symptoms.  There was no damage to the facility.  An incident investigation was initiated immediately and the cause of the release was determined to be the valve having been over tightened.   Corrective action included reinforcing correct operating procedures and making all operators aware of the incident.  Due to the small quantity of chlorine released no regulatory agencies were notified.  There were no other chlorine releases during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nOur emergency response program is designed to protect employee and public health and the environment.

Missouri American Water Company works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, local fire and police departments, St. Louis County Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Team and other first responder agencies.  We conduct regular drills with community emergency responders in order to practice and improve our emergency response plans.  In the event or a real emergency, local authorities have plans in place to communicate with the public regarding response and protection actions.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll chlorine is scheduled to be removed from the site by early Fall 2009 if the new hyprochlorite system demonstrates high demand reliability."
