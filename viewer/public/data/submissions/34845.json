      "SummaryText": "City of Saginaw Water Treatment Plant Executive Summary\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant provides quality drinking water to the residents of Saginaw County and surrounding areas.  Chlorine gas is used in the treatment process to disinfect drinking water.  Disinfection protects customers from contracting water-borne diseases.  \n\nChlorine gas is stored on site in the form of one-ton cylinders.  Typically, ten cylinders are on site, of which four are connected and available for use at any time.  Treatment plant staff and the Saginaw Fire Department are trained to react to accidental releases of chlorine gas.  Written procedures for the handling of chlorine are in place as well as periodic employee training on the hazards and safe handling of chlorine is conducted.\n\nAccident prevention is accomplished by adherence to written procedures, employee training, monitoring systems, and inspections.  All maintenance employees are trained in the safe handling of chlorine gas from delivery to hook-up.  Employees are also trained in the use of a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) along with a repair kit for minor leaks.  All operations employees that use chlorine feed equipment are trained in the proper start-up and shut down procedures to prevent overpressure situations that could cause leaks.  All plant personnel receive hazardous materials training.  Non-affected personnel receive Awareness level training.  All management and maintenance personnel receive Operations level training.\n   \nIn addition to employee training, a chlorine leak detection system is used to continuously monitor for chlorine gas leaks in all areas where chlorine cylinders are stored and chlorine gas feed lines are located.  The sensors used will alarm above a set concentration of gas detected.  The alarms serve two functions.  The first of which is to alert plant personnel that a leak exists.  The second function is to shut down the chlorine feed system to facilitate in minimizing the consequences of the l"

      "SummaryText": "eak.  Each connected cylinder has an automatic shut off device that will close the flow of chlorine from all cylinders in use, in the event of chlorine gas being detected by the monitoring system.  The monitoring system is checked routinely to assure that all components are functioning correctly.  All plant personnel and contractors on site must respond to each alarm as written in the emergency response plan.  Contractors must go through an orientation session before working on site.  The hazards of chlorine and proper response to an alarm are covered in addition to other plant procedures.  Our piping system is designed for use with chlorine gas and is also inspected.\n\nThe Saginaw Water Plant always strives to improve the safety of the chlorine gas system.  In 1999 new valves were specified on ton cylinders that greatly reduce the potential for leaks at the valves.   Also, in 2001 new chlorine feed lines were installed.  The topic of chlorine and ideas on how to improve the system are discussed at a majority of the monthly safety meetings.  In addition, the process safety committee reviews the process routinely.\n\nA record of all incidents is kept on file.  The Saginaw Water Treatment Plant is required to list the five-year accident history.  There have been no reportable accidents or releases in the last five years.  \n\nThe Saginaw Water Treatment Plant works with local and county agencies to respond to chlorine emergencies and keep the community informed.  The Saginaw Fire Department has been trained to respond to chlorine emergencies at the Water Treatment Plant.  The Saginaw Fire Department also conducts the Hazardous Materials Training of plant personnel. The Saginaw County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) aids the Saginaw Water Treatment Plant in keeping the community aware of the types and quantities of chemicals used."
