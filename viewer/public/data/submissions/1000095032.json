To conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 30,850 pounds \npiping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) to provide refrigeration for the production and distribution of ice. Typical operating conditions range from 10 psig on the low-pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side. Like a household refrigerator, there are no expected leaks or releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system at Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc., which is a closed-loop system.\n\nHigh pressure liquid from the High-Pressure Receiver is supplied to the Flash Economizer. From the Flash Economizer, the ammonia is fed to the -10\u00b0F and +10\u00b0F Recirculated Liquid Recirculation Packages. The -10\u00b0F Recirculated Liquid Recirculation Package RRP-2 supplies sub-cooled liquid ammonia to Evaporators E-1 to E-16, and then the 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) ammonia is sent back to the -10\u00b0F Recirculated Liquid Recirculation Package RRP-2. The liquid settles to the bottom and the vapor rises to the top and is drawn off by Compressors C-3, C-4, and C-5. The +10\u00b0F Recirculated Liquid Recirculation Package RRP-1 supplies sub-cooled liquid ammonia to the Ice Machines and receives ammonia vapor/liquid mix from the Ice Machines. In the RRP-1, liquid settles to the bottom and vapor rises to the top and is drawn by Compressors C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6. From the compressors, the ammonia vapor is discharged to the Evaporative Condensers, Evaporators E-1 to E-16, and Ice Machines. The Heat Exchanger receives high stage discharge from Compressors C-1 - C-6 and discharges high pressure liquid to the High-Pressure Receiver. The ammonia leaving the Evaporative Condensers is high pressure liquid which gravity flows into the\nr\tHigh Pressure Receiver via the Thermosyphon R"

The facility's Emergency Coordinators (Chief Engineer, Regional Manager, and/or Senior Plant Manager) have discussed an emergency action plan with the City of Los Angeles County Fire Department (Incident Commander). In an emergency (ammonia release), the Emergency Coordinator role is to alert employees of an evacuation and to ensure all employees and visitors/contractors have exited the building safely. The Emergency Coordinator immediately calls 911 while waiting for City of Los Angeles County Fire Department to arrive at the scene. The rest of the employees are to be evacuated from the facility to a designated area. The contact information for the Emergency Coordinators and agencies are detailed in the Arctic Glacier Vernon Facility's Emergency Action Plan included in this Program.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc. facility is located at 2970 East 50th Street in Vernon, California, which is located approximately 3.6 miles east of Interstate 110, 3.2 miles west of Interstate 710, and 2 miles south of Interstate 5.

For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits. Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled. The facility also utilizes fixed ammonia leak detectors to alert personnel of a possible ammonia leak, to call the fire department when the concentration has reached 25 ppm, and to shut down the system at 10,000 ppm. Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over pressurization.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe CalARP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\u0095\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\n\u0095\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or that meet the criteria above in the last five years (July 2016-Jan 2023).\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.

The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation was performed on July 28, 2021to satisfy the five-year update requirements. The status of the recommendations resulting from the previous Process Hazard Analysis (2016) was reviewed during the PHA Revalidation study. The 2019 Three-Year Compliance Audit and the 2021 Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation studies generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc. facility located in Vernon, California. The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures. The Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc. safety committee is planning to complete several items, including all outstanding and new recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.
