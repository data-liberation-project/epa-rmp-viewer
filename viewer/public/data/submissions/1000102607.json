The BGF site is located on the State Road PR-923, Km. 1.7, Buena Vista Ward in Humacao, Puerto Rico and it is bound by the North, West and South by the operations of ECL and to the East by the State Road PR-923 and Palacios del Mar residential development. The primary operations at the BGF facility correspond to processes of converting the LFG to Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) to be commercialized gases.\n\nAs an introductory statement, the Landfill Gas (LFG) is a product derived from the breakdown or biodegradation of the organic matter of the landfill system under anaerobic conditions. The raw LFG generated by the landfill system will be recovered and transported, through pipelines, to the conversion plant to be processed and converted to RNG and renewable CO2 (RCO2). The process involves the removal of Sulphur compounds, CO2, and organic and inorganic compounds to manufacture RNG with a high energy content is to be produced as well as to produce electric power that will meet the demand of the site and that of the ECL. \n\n The LFG, then, will be refined, compressed, and liquefied until reaching a liquid state to be able to dispatch as RNG fuel. As a landfill gas refinery plant, the main substance used and/or handled at the facility is methane gas in form of liquified RNG. The maximum quantity of gas onsite is expected to be 217,371 pounds stored in six isotank containers, each one provided with level, pressure and temperature measurement technology and alarm system to promptly identify any leak and helping prevent costly product loss and potential safety incidents.\n\nIt is the policy of BGF to conduct its operations in a manner that minimizes health and safety risks to its employees, contractors, and the general public.
