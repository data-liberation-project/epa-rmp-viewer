(MarkWest) - Mobley facility located in near West Virginia is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Wetzel County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPCs) which provide emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses natural gas liquids (NGLs) extraction.  The NGL extracted is considered a Y-grade mixture.  This is the one substance present at the facility that is regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  The flammable substance is a mixture comprised of ethane, propane, butane, isobutene, pentane, isopentane and C6+ components. \r\n\r\nThe Y-grade is extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline and briefly held in a surge tank.  A pipeline transfers the liquids from the surge tank to a fractionation facility at another location for further processing.\r\n \r\nSurge tanks are located at each processing train at the Mobley facility.  Generally the surge tanks operate at about 50% of capacity.  The actual amount at any given time may fluctuate due to fluctuations in load to the processing plant.  \r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facili"

The Risk Management Plan provided herein summarizes the active release prevention program that is currently in place at the facility.  This risk management program illustrates MarkWest's commitment to employee, public, and environmental safety.

The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario would be a release of the entire contents of a 53,500-gallon NGL Surge Tank. This would result in a release of 253,213 lbs and impact a radius of 0.5 miles in all directions.\r\n\r\nThere is no alternative-case scenario that would be more common than the worst-case scenario and that would have an impact in the off-site consequence analysis; therefore, one is not required per the RMP regulations.   However, the EPA CDX RMP software will not allow submission without completing an alternative case scenario.  The alternative case scenario will be classified as a process piping release of natural gas for 1 min before the hydrocarbon detection system could trigger an emergency shutdown. At a flow rate of 200 mmcf/d, using a density for methane of 0.042 lb/ft3 and a release duration of 1 minute would result in a total release of 5,833 lbs of methane gas and impact a radius of 0.2 miles in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case and alternative case radius of impact was determined using the EPA RMP-COMP model.  Populations within those radii were determined using the Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS), Version 10c using data from Summary File 1, 2010 Census and by inputing the coordinate points and the radius of influence.  \r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \r\n\tSteps\r\n\r\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.

The What If? methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is undertaken.  MarkWest has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards relating to the contractor's work and the associated processes.  Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nMarkWest has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\r\n\r\n6.\tEmergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nA written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances is retained at the MarkWest facility.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe Wetzel County LEPC is the local emergency response agency with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety  \r\n\r\nMarkWest will continue to monitor the implementation of the RMP program at the Mobley facility to ensure that accidental release of flammable materials does not occur.
