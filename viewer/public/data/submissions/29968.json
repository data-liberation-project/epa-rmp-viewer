The plant is a municipal facility, owned and operated by the City of Texarkana, Texas, located in the City of Texarkana, Bowie County, Texas with an approximate capacity of (18) million gallons per day. The facility's only activity is to treat surface water to drinking water standards for customers in the Texarkana area.\n\nLiguid chlorine is the only chemical used in sufficient quantity at the facility to be regulated under the RMP program. Up to fourteen (14) one ton cylinders are stored on site at any one time with no more than two cylinders, piped independently, used in the process.\n\nTexarkana Water Utilities is dedicated to the safe and proper handling of chemicals necessary for the production of drinking water and treatment  of wastewater for its citizens. Utility management has consistently budgeted and the elected bodies of the two Texarkana's have consistently approved funds to support personnel and citizen safety preventative maintenance training, chemical awareness and handling, emergency response and equipment related to chemicals used at the facility.\n\nSeveral training and procedural methods make a worst case release unlilkely. The site is staffed twenty-four (24) hours a day with periodic inspections of the chlorination facilities made on each of the three daily shifts. Hightly trained personnel and an extensive preventative maintenance program keep all chlorination equipment in like new condition. The chlorination room is monitored by a remote chlorine gas detector and alarm set a 1 ppm. Safety procedures, including those associated with chlorine are standardized through written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's). Chlorine cylinder repair kits are kept at several locations in the system.\n\nThere have been no reportable chlorine releases or accidents for a period exceed"
