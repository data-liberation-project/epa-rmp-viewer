This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and integrating safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  An important part of our approach to process safety management is a risk management program (RMP) that helps us (a) manage the risks associated with using hazardous chemicals at our facility and (b) comply with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions: Risk Management Regulation (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at FSC.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule.\n\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n\u00b7 A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see Sections 3 and 5 of this executive summary\n\n\u00b7 A prevention program to help safely maintain and operate any process that contains a sufficient quantity of a RMP-listed regulated substances such that the process is covered by the RMP rule - see Section 4 of this executive summary\n\n\u00b7 An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from a process covered by the RMP rule - see Section 6 of this executive summary\n\nHowever, the risk management program is but one part of FSC's comprehensive safety program within which we have developed and implemented multiple levels of safeguards against accidental"

Before using a hazardous chemical, we always consider less hazardous alternatives.  When we must use a hazardous chemical, we consider the potential for this chemical to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\u00b7 Preventing releases of hazardous chemicals.  When a hazardous chemical is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, maintained and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government codes, standards, and good practices are closely adhered to in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the equipment.\n\n\u00b7 Limiting damage from a potential release.  Process safety is integrated into all FSC activities, with the intention of preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  However, we have trained our workforce to quickly recognize accidental releases and have organized and trained an emergency response team to quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to stop and to mitigate the release. We work closely with the Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency and City of South Portland Fire Department to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.  \n\nOur overall safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This executive summary is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe are committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

These steps include (1) training programs for personnel, (2) programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our covered process, and (3) programs to evaluate the hazards of our covered process.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we will strive to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or damage to the environment.  We provide basic emergency training to all onsite personnel and extensive training on emergency response to our emergency response team which is organized and trained in accordance with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation, 29 CFR 1910.120.  Thus, all onsite personnel have been provided with the training necessary for them to address emergency situations and execute emergency response actions as appropriate.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances Onsite\n\nFSC has one process, growth of Epitaxial Silicon, which uses two RMP-listed regulated substances, each of which is in an inventory greater than the threshold quantities specified in the RMP rule tables.  These two regulated substances are hydrogen chloride (HCL), which is a toxic gas, and trichlorosilane (TCS), which is a flammable liquid.\n\nFSC's RMP-covered process consists of (1) processing equipment installed, owned, operated, and maintained by FSC, and (2) the HCL and TCS bulk chemical delivery systems that are designed, installed, owned, operated, and maintained by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APCI).  To help ensure full compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, FSC personnel provided oversight and were involved as appropriate in many APCI activities during the design and installation of the bulk chemical delivery systems, and will continue to provide oversight and work with APCI personnel as they operate and maintain their equipment.  As appropriate, APCI will follow FSC's procedures for activities such as (1) using other contractors onsite, (2) followi"

FSC plans to assess APCI's PSM programs as a part of their future PSM/RMP*Compliance audits.   \n\n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\n\nWe performed the OCA to estimate the potential for accidental releases of HCL and TCS that could affect the public or the environment. We evaluated one worst-case release scenario for each of these regulated substances since they are in different hazard classes.  We also analyzed numerous alternative-case release scenarios so that we were certain that the scenarios documented in the RMPlan represented the greatest offsite endpoint distances.  The alternative-case release scenarios modeled were all more reasonable than the worst-case release scenarios but were all considered unlikely to occur due to our having thoroughly integrating process safety concerns into the design, fabrication, installation, and the ongoing operation and maintenance of the covered process.\n\nWe do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  We consider these failure scenarios to be unrealistic but necessary for estimating the absolute maximum possible areas that could be affected by releases at our facility.  The alternative-case release scenarios that were analyzed by FSC will provide emergency responders with information that should help them to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe primary reason for performing the OCA was to determine the offsite areas within which adverse effects to people and the environment could occur due to an accidental release.  Should such releases occur, we would expect the following:\n\n\u00b7 HCL releases - For exposures to HCL, most people at the outer edge of the affected areas (called the endpoint distance) would likely be able to walk away from an exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are li"

At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would likely be more severe; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would likely be less severe.\n\n\u00b7 TCS releases - In performing the OCA, it was determined that the effects of a worst-case release scenario for TCS will extend only slightly beyond FSC's property line, but will not encompass any offsite public receptors.  Therefore, offsite effects due to TCS releases should be minimal. \n\nFSC used the most recent version (version 1.07) of EPA's RMP*Comp software to perform its OCA, and also compared the results to those obtained by using EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document to verify their accuracy.  The following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis that was performed. \n\n3.1  HCL - Worst-case Release Scenario \n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a rupture of one of seven hydrogen chloride storage tubes on a tube trailer (each tube contains 3,000 lb of HCL when full).  This analysis is based on (1) the storage tube being full at the time of the release, and (2) all HCL being released and vaporized in a 10-minute time period.  FSC took no controls or mitigation systems into consideration when performing this worst-case release scenario analysis for HCL.  The distance estimated by RMP*Comp to the toxic endpoint includes offsite public receptors but no environmental receptors.  The estimated endpoint distance and specific public receptors affected are detailed in FSC's OCA documentation.  \n\nBecause this worst-case release scenario analysis indicates that offsite public receptors could be adversely affected, and the HCL system is also covered under OSHA's PSM regulation, the epitaxial reactor process qualifies as a RMP Program Level 3 process.\n\n3.2  HCL - Alternative-case Release Scenario\n\nThe selected alternative-case release scenario for HCL involves a rupt"

Although the release rate will decline as the internal pressure of the HCL tube drops, FSC conservatively assumed that the release would continue at the same rate.  Although a FSC employee would likely be able to quickly stop such a release, FSC conservatively assumed that the release would continue until the HCL tube is empty.  While this release is most likely to occur inside the ventilated building containing the HCL tube trailer, FSC did not take credit for this mitigation system when performing the alternative-case release analysis since they did not believe the building met the criteria provided in RMP*Comp (i.e., a release into a building or shed with opening to the outside).  FSC also did not take credit for any other controls or mitigation systems when performing the alternative-case release scenario analysis for HCL.  The distance estimated by RMP*Comp to the toxic endpoint (.030 mg/L) includes offsite public receptors but no environmental receptors.  The estimated endpoint distance and specific public receptors affected are detailed in FSC's OCA documentation.   \n\n3.3 TCS - Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the rupture of a full TCS ISO container (40,000 lb).  This analysis is based on (1) an instantaneously spill of a full ISO container, (2) formation of a TCS liquid pool, (3) vaporization over a 10 minute time period, and (4) a vapor cloud explosion.  FSC took credit for passive mitigation (i.e., a dike of 228 sq. ft. by 4.9 ft average depth) when performing the worst-case release scenario analysis for TCS.

When we increased the onsite inventories of HCL and TCS and exceeded the threshold quantities specified by OSHA's PSM regulation and EPA's RMP rule, FSC's safety and process safety programs had been upgraded and were in full compliance with both of these regulations.  Although the prevention program requirements of the RMP rule are nearly identical to those of the PSM regulation, the following sections of this executive summary briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.  Our accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n4.1. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n4.1.1 Process safety information.  FSC has established a PSM Filing System that resides in our online Documentum system.  The PSM Filing System contains all RMP-required records by either (1) containing an electronic version of the record, (2) referencing the location within the facility where the printed record exists, or (3) providing an electro"

      "SummaryText": "nic link to the record.  The PSI documentation in our PSM Filing System includes (but is not limited to) information about (a) the chemicals in our covered process, (b) the technology of our covered process (e.g., process chemistry, safe limits and the consequences of exceeding the limits, maximum chemical inventories), and (c) the equipment in our covered process (e.g., specifications, design codes and standards, relief systems, ventilation systems, engineering drawings).   We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\n\n4.1.2. Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update the process hazard analyses performed for our covered process to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  To perform a process hazard analysis, a multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Each team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The teams systematically address the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. Each team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to the appropriate personnel and necessary actions are taken to enhance the safety of the process.  Each analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n4.1.3. Operating procedures.  Our process engineers, operators, and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures/specifications to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely and properly performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n\u00b7 Steps for safely conducting activitie"

Training.  We train workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes both initial and refresher training (performed as a part of our annual operator re-certification process) that covers (a) a general overview of the process, (b) the properties and hazards of the chemicals in the process, and (c) a detailed review of applicable operating procedures and safe work practices.  Written testing, observation, and/or demonstration are performed as appropriate to verify that employees understand the training material, and records of this training and the means used to verify understanding are maintained.\n\n4.1.5. Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our covered process.\n\n4.1.6. Management of change.  We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that changes do not adversely affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with another valve of identical specifications) must be approved through the management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety infor"

We recognize that new or newly modified are historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of any new or modified process before placing it into service to help ensure its safe operation.  This review confirms that:\n\n\u00b7 Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\u00b7 Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n\u00b7 Employee training has been completed\n\u00b7 For a covered process, a process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new, or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\n4.1.8. Compliance audit.  One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is performing thorough assessments on a regular basis.  We audit our covered process at least every 3 years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations.  To conduct an audit, we assemble a team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process.  The team evaluates whether our prevention program satisfies the requirements of the PSM and RMP regulations and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of an audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\n4.1.9. Incident investigation.  We investigate all incidents that have or could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident potentially having such effects.  When an incident is reported, we assemble an investigation team and initiate the investigation as soon as possible, and"

Employee participation.  We have a written employee participation plan that summarizes the actions we've taken and are continuing to take to involve our workers in our PSM and RMP-related activities.  We believe involving our workers greatly improves our efforts and helps to ensure that their safety concerns are addressed.  We encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities for the covered process.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program, and have easy access to all PSM and RMP-related records.\n\n4.1.11. Hot work permits.  We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our facility.  We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with those requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the designated FSC employee reviews the completed form and the work area before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices orientation.\n\n4.1.12. Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  Generally, training of contract personnel is accomplished by (1) explaining to the contract employer the hazards of the covered process, our safe work practices, and the applicable provisions of our emergency response procedures then (2) relying on the contract employer to provide training, verify understanding of the training, and document the training for each of their employees before the employee begins work in our facility.

FSC also performs periodic evaluations to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their duties under the RMP rule.\n\nIt is also important to note that contract employers/employees performing any type of work on/near a covered process may also be involved with other FSC PSM/RMP-related activities.  For example, they may (1) access to PSM/RMP-related documentation (as per the employee participation element), (2) be involved on a PHA or incident investigation team, and/or (3) may have to obtain a hot work or other type permit (as per the operating procedures or hot work permit elements).    \n\n4.2  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, special measures and safety features specific to HCL and TCS have been implemented by FSC to prevent accidents or releases.  These prevention measures and features include (but are not limited to) the following items.\n\nHCL System\n\n\u00b7 An enclosed building to house the HCL tube trailer\n\u00b7 A dedicated emergency release scrubbing system designed to handle HCL releases inside the HCL tube trailer building\n\u00b7 Toxic gas monitoring in all exhaust systems and breathing zones.

This system will activate the foam fire suppression system in the TCS building\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nFollowing a thorough review and guidance from a consulting firm specializing in the areas of PSM/RMP regulatory compliance, FSC determined that the RMP rule requirement to compile a five-year accident history did not apply to FSC when they submitted their initial RMPlan to EPA.  FSC could not have had a release from an RMP-covered process prior to increasing the inventories of HCL and TCS since it was the inventory increases that first triggered RMP-coverage.  Prior to the addition of the bulk chemical delivery systems, FSC used HCL and TCS in cylinders containing far less than the threshold quantities listed in the RMP rule.\n\nFSC will maintain a five-year accident history to document any future accidental releases meeting the specified criteria, and the documentation will include all required data.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Programs\n\nFSC has developed and implemented an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to help ensure the safety of (1) all personnel working onsite, and (2) emergency response team personnel who will respond to accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The ICP plan includes procedures for:\n\n\u00b7 Informing the City of South Portland Fire Department, the Maine DEP and the Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency (i.e., the Cumberland County LEPC) about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n\u00b7 Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous chemicals\n\u00b7 Obtaining outside assist"

Our emergency response team receives extensive training on responding to releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency is responsible for notifying the public of emergency situations, if necessary.\n\nThe ICP is designed to comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations including the provisions of OSHA's PSM regulation and EPA's RMP rule.  The ICP is available to all employees via FSC's online document control system and has also been provided to local and state agencies including the City of South Portland Fire Department, City of South Portland Police Department, Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency, Maine Emergency Management Agency, local area Hospitals and FSC's licensed hazardous waste contractor.  Also, a Cumberland County Emergency Operation Plan has been developed by the Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency of which FSC's Manager of Emergency and Protective Services is a member.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFSC constantly strives to improve the safety of our covered process.  For example, as part of our prevention program we test and inspect equipment; analyze process safety; review written programs, plans, and procedures; consult with employees; confirm completion of activities; audit for compliance; investigate incidents; and evaluate performance.  These and many other prevention program activities result in findings, recommendations, or suggestions for improvement.  Each finding, recommendation, and suggestion provided to plant management is given serious consideration and is implemented"
