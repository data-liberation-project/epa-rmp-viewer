This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending System, including the associated piping and two (2) 60,000 gallon butane storage vessels. KMLT owns the real property associated with the Butane Blending System. Energy Transfer LP (ET) owns all the equipment associated with the Butane Blending System. ET and KMLT each have operational responsibilities for the Butane Blending System. ET controls and monitors all butane blending operations remotely from its control center located near Houston, Texas, conducts all maintenance activities, and schedules the delivery of butane trucks. KMLT oversees the unloading of butane trucks into the storage vessel and conducts routine visual inspections.\n\n\n\nET constructed the Butane Blending System in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) No. 58 (2011 Edition) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage. ET designed, constructed, and maintains the Butane Blending System, in accordance with NFPA No. 58 and the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations.\n\n\n\nIt is the Parties' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes. If an emergency were to occur, it is the Parties' policy to notify the Kinder Morgan Liquids Terminals Emergency Response Team (ERT) as well as Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) and the City of Pasadena Emergency Management. \n\n\n\nThe Parties comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the local fire department. The Kinder Morgan Liquids Terminals Emergency Response Team (ERT) have participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\n\n\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (approximately 80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices. Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this \"stationary source\" as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection.\n\n\n\nThe Parties actively seek employee input on process safety improvements. Additionally, the Kinder Morgan Liquids Terminals Emergency Response Team (ERT) is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion.\n\n"
