Facility Policy\n          The owners, management and employees of Big Wapsie Ag Services are committed to the \n           prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should\n           occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Fayette County LEPC,\n           and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and\n           the environment.\n\n     2.   Facility Information\n\n           The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n           Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stoered would be 20000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n     3.   Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n           a.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released\n           as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 53,000 pounds,\n           which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by\n           design standards and administrative controls. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion        \n            to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .70 mile.\n\n           b.
