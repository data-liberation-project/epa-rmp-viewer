Transfer of operations, including all associated wage and salaried personnel, from Solutia to the process owner, Ineos Melamines LLC, was initiated on March 1, 2010.  At the time of this resubmittal, Solutia no longer has any interest in the ownership or operations of the aforementioned process.  Refer to the appropriate sections of this Executive Summary for additional details.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Solutia's Indian Orchard Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes, especially those using hazardous substances, in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs, process safety management systems, and emergency response planning to help ensure the safety and health of our employees, the public, and the environment.

      "SummaryText": "stablished by the Fiberloid Corporation in 1904 and purchased by Monsanto Company in 1938.  In 1963, Monsanto acquired the Shawinigan Resins facility on the opposite side of Grochmal Avenue, creating the current site.  The plant took the Indian Orchard name in 1982 and following a spin-off from Monsanto in 1997, Solutia Inc. was formed.  The site includes manufacturing units producing high-value specialty products that include Saflex interlayer, Gelva adhesives, and Butvar resin.  The site also includes a Technical Center, complete with research laboratories and pilot plant facilities, finished product warehouse buildings, wastewater collection and neutralization facilities, a powerhouse, analytical laboratories, and office buildings.  In addition, IneosNOVA, Ineos Melamines, and MassPower each own and operate facilities within the borders of the Indian Orchard site.  Soca USA, leases a former warehouse building from Solutia to house a small recycling process they own and operate at the site as well.  Under current site operations, the Adhesives Department processes, and all associated assets, are owned by Cytec Industries, Inc.  However, these processes continue to be operated and maintained by Solutia employees.  As a result, the processes of the Adhesives Department are included in SolutiaA?s process safety and risk management programs and have been reported, as applicable, in this Risk Management Plan.  The entire plant occupies approximately 250 acres and Solutia currently employs approximately 460 people from the greater Springfield area and the surrounding communities.  Additional employees for IneosNOVA, Ineos Melamines, MassPower, Cytec Industries, and Soca USA also work at the site.  \n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nIn our current production processes, we use only one chemical that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release; vinyl acetate monomer.\n\nVinyl acetate monomer "

An average of 3 railcars are typically present at the site at any given time; however, a maximum of 5 railcars may be stored at the site to support plant operations.  These railcars are unloaded into an aboveground storage tank that has a capacity of approximately 200,000 gallons and is filled to 80% capacity or 160,000 gallons.  This tank is located inside a concrete containment structure designed to hold the entire contents of the tank in the event of an accidental release.  The plantA?s Adhesives Department uses vinyl acetate in the production of numerous Gelva adhesive products for various applications while our South Butvar Department utilizes vinyl acetate as a key raw material in the production of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) resin.  This resin is the primary ingredient in the manufacture of a plastic sheet (interlayer) that is A?sandwichedA? in laminated safety glass for automotive and architectural applications.  A significantly smaller A?Day TankA? of approximately 5,000 gallons capacity, is utilized in each department to support daily production needs.\n\nFormaldehyde solution (formalin) was previously reported by Solutia in Risk Management Plan submittals for 1999, 2004, and 2009 under the Resimenes Department operations.

His primary responsibilities include implementation of SolutiaA?s corporate process safety and risk management requirements and initiatives as well as enhancement of the existing programs at the site.  Our Process Safety Lead functions as the Indian Orchard Plant representative on SolutiaA?s company-wide Process Safety Core Team, Facility Siting Task Force, and Management of Change Team.  A great deal of progress has been made in the continuous improvement of the process safety and risk management systems at the Indian Orchard Plant, and within Solutia as a whole, since the previous RMP resubmittal.  Some examples of these improvements i"

At the Indian Orchard Plant, revalidation studies were conducted to evaluate the processes in both the Resimenes and South Butvar Departments during 2009 and early 2010.\n\nLayers of Protection Analysis (LOPA):  The Process Safety Core Team finalized the corporate procedure for conducting and documenting Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) and additional training was provided to personnel responsible for conducting these evaluations.  At the Indian Orchard Plant, the Solutia LOPA technique was utilized during the revalidation of the PHAs in both the Resimenes and South Butvar Departments.\n\nFacility Siting:  During the course of 2009 and 2010 to date, several tasks related to facility siting were conducted by the Indian Orchard Plant including the following:  revision of building occupancy surveys; updates to portable and temporary building inventories; and finalization of the siteA?s Facility Siting Evaluation Report.  SolutiaA?s company-wide Facility Siting Team conducted a review of recent changes to API Recommended Practice 752 and is currently completing revisions to the corporate Facility Siting Procedure.\n\nCombustible Dust Program:  The Process Safety Core Team has developed a draft procedure to detail the approach for evaluating combustible dust hazards and specify requirements for managing these hazards in SolutiaA?s facilities.  Indian OrchardA?s Process Safety Lead has been directly involved in the development of this document and will be initiating implementation following approval of the corporate requirements by SolutiaA?s ESH Governance Council.\n\nSafety Instrumented Systems:  The programs and practices for Safety Instrumented Systems, known as Instrumented Protective Systems (IPSs)"

      "SummaryText": " at the Indian Orchard Plant, continue to evolve and improve.  Several IPS reviews were conducted for our manufacturing processes during 2009 and 2010 including the use of Layers of Protection Analysis to confirm the classification of critical instruments during the PHA revalidations in Resimenes and South Butvar.  The plantA?s designated IPS issue owner continued making progress in the evaluation of the siteA?s existing interlock classifications and conversion to SolutiaA?s newly-adopted integrity level (IL) system.  In addition, our IPS issue owner continues to be an active member of SolutiaA?s IPS Network, tasked with the development of company-wide standards and work practices related to instrumented protective systems and alarms.  Currently the team is working on the development of an instructor-based training program for delivery to site personnel in late 2010.\n"
