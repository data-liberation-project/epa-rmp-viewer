This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\r\n\r\n1.0 RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Fleischmann's Yeast facility in Memphis, Tennessee has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Response Program to ensure the safety of its employees, the community, and the environment. This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and contacting appropriate outside personnel involved in containing an ammonia release. All of these components make the Emergency Action Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response. The emergency response policies at the Fleischmann's Yeast facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \r\n\r\n2.0 PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nFleischmann's Yeast is a producer of baker's yeast. The NAICS code for the process at this facility is 311999. Fleischmann's Yeast has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia is used in the process as an ingredient in the manufacturing of baker's yeast.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering the applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the process is documented at approximately 97,600 pounds. This amount exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds so is regulated by the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n3.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nFleischmann's Yeast has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia feed system. At Fleischmann's Yeast, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program. EPA has said that if the process is"

      "SummaryText": "in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3. Thus, Fleischmann's Yeast ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \r\n\r\nListed below are key aspects of the ammonia release prevention program:\r\n\r\n1. Most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery and so there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.  Bollards and/or walls have been added to increase the protection of the ammonia tank and lines.\r\n\r\n2. Employee training on ammonia is conducted annually.\r\n\r\n4.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere has not been any accidental releases in the past 5 years above the reporting threshold.  \r\n\r\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, the Fleischmann's Yeast facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan. The response plan is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel. For all emergencies, Emergency Services Coordinator, has operating authority for emergency response at the site of release and assumes control of the incident scene beyond the first responder awareness level.\r\n\r\nThis document contains specific information regarding: contact numbers; emergency communication; incident team job descriptions; evacuation zones; emergency evacuation procedures; notification procedures; training; emergency shutdown procedures; personnel roles and lines of authority; emergency recognition and prevention; safe distances and places of refuge; site security and control; medical/first aid treatment; emergency alerting and response procedures; PPE and emergency equipment; and standard operating procedures in the event of an ammonia release.\r\n\r\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety are being identified and implemented based on feedback during the PHA and the internal improvement reporting process."
