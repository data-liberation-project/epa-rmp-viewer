      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Program has been developed for ECKERT COLD STORAGE CO. located at 19901 McHenry Avenue, Escalon, California.\n\n\nIt is the policy of ECKERT COLD STORAGE to provide training, conduct inspections, and maintain the refrigeration equipment to prevent accidental releases. It is also our policy to provide training to all employees in emergency response and evacuation procedures.\n\nECKERT COLD STORAGE utilizes two ammonia refrigeration systems. One system contains 23,500 pounds of ammonia and the other contains 4,000 pounds. The systems are used to cool and freeze vegetables.\n\nWorst-case scenarios and alternative scenarios have been modeled using the program RMP Comp. \n\nThe worst-case scenario is a sudden loss of all of the ammonia in the larger system. This would result in a 1.46 mile radius endpoint with possibly 4,000 people affected.\n\nThe alternative scenario is a broken pipe or line. This would result in a 3.57-mile radius to endpoint with possibly 7,060 people affected.\n\nIn order to prevent these scenarios ECKERT COLD STORAGE maintain the refrigeration equipment and makes daily, weekly, monthly and yearly inspections on it.\nSensors are in place to shut equipment off. Alarms are in place to notify operators of high or low pressures. Training of employees is ongoing.\n\nECKERT COLD STORAGE has operated in Escalon since 1996 and has not had a release of ammonia in the 8 years of operation.\n\nAs mentioned before all employees are trained in emergency response and evacuation procedures. Supervisors and Maintenance employees receive additional training, which includes the names and numbers of the organizations that must be notified in an emergency.\n\nChanges to improve the safety of the system are brought up in the Safety Committee meetings and discussed. If significant changes are made, the RMP document will be revised accordingly."
