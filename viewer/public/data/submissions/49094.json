Employees participated in the system review and process hazards analysis.  The Company has trained and properly equipped its employees who will be responding to potential releases from these systems.  Also, the Company?s emergency response procedures provide for notification of outside emergency responders to give on-site assistance and/or emergency evacuation/shelter-in-place notification of affected residents in the event of an ammonia or chlorine release.\n\nStationary source and regulated substance handled\n\nThe Ameren Energy Generating Coffeen Power Plant is located in Montgomery County, Illinois, approximately 2.5 miles south of the city of Coffeen on man-made Coffeen Lake.  Coffeen plant began producing electricity in 1965.\nThe plant has chlorinated its circulating and service water systems from initial operation without any significant releases or injuries. The chlorination system has been periodically upgraded, and has safely used one ton cylinders of chlorine since 1993. \nThe plant typically uses approximately 60,000 pounds of chlorine each year to prevent biofouling of condensers and other equipment from water drawn from Coffeen Lake.  Chlorine is added to the circulating water of each unit for ten minutes, twelve times daily. The system is checked at least three times daily by operations.  Leak checks are also conducted whenever a new bank of cylinders is placed in service.  The chlorine cylinders are located within a fenced area near the plant entrance.  The system has leak detectors, as well as alarms to warn of process deviations.\nThe plant installed a selective catalytic reduction unit (SCR) on one of its two coal-fired units in the fall of 2001. The SCR unit began commercial oper"
