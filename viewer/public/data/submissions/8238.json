In addition to the OSHA and RMP prevention systems and measures, specific prevention measures and equipment  for formaldehyde include: a continuously monitored production process with multiple automatic shut downs in the event of abnormal situations, administrative controls to limit the level to which the storage tank can be filled, storage tank level indicators and alarms, process equipment and storage tank pressure relief devices, storage tank transfer operation and building vent scrubbers, process vent catalytic oxidizer, secondary containment around the production, storage and shipping areas, electrical grounding of storage tank, process equipment and railcars and tank trucks during loading, operator attendance during transfer operations, check valves on piping to prevent backup of material, and area firewater monitor nozzles at all formaldehyde areas.   Periodic visual inspections of the area and equipment are also conducted.",

Both companies are owned by HNA Holdings, Inc.   The facility is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner using a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning programs.  \n\nCovered Chemicals\n\nThe facility is regulated under RMP due to the presence of chlorine, vinyl acetate, and formaldehyde, which are present in amounts greater than the threshold quantity as defined by the RMP rule. \n\nChlorine is used at the site to disinfect drinking water and process water.  Chlorine is stored on-site in 1-ton (2000 lb) cylinders.  \n\nVinyl acetate is one of the chemicals stored on-site at the chemical distribution terminal.  Vinyl acetate is received via rail tankcars, stored in an atmospheric storage tank, and is shipped via tank truck to the merchant market in the U.S. southeast regional area.\n\nFormaldehyde is produced for merchant market sales to customers in the U. S. southeast regional area, and is stored on-site as an aqueous solution in heated atmospheric tanks.  Shipments of aqueous formaldehyde solutions are made in both rail tankcar and tank truck quantities.  \n\nHazard Assessments\n\nWorst case and alternative release scenario assessments were conducted for the facility's three regulated substances: chlorine, vinyl acetate, and formaldehyde.  The chlorine Worst Case Scenario (WCS) was selected to represent the toxic chemicals' WCS at the facility since this scenario reaches the farthest beyond the plant property boundary and all the public receptors of the other cases are included in this case.  In the chlorine WCS, a sudden rupture and release of chlorine gas from a 1-ton cylinder would reach off-site end"

Reference tables from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants were used for these calculations.  \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine is based on a leak of chlorine gas from a cylinder valve or regulator.  The toxic endpoint distance for this scenario remains within the property line of the Celanese facility, and does not go off-site.  Reference tables from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants were  used for these calculations.  \n \nThe Alternative Release Scenario  for vinyl acetate is a rupture of a railcar unloading hose, resulting in a liquid release of the contents of the railcar into drains and sumps.  Due to the location of the rail car unloading area, the toxic endpoint distance for this scenario goes off-site and affects an adjoining industrial area and an unpopulated area.  EPA's OCA Guidance equations were used for these calculations.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for formaldehyde was considered to be the rupture of a storage tank, releasing the liquid contents of the tank into a diked area.  The toxic endpoint distance for this scenario   remains within the property line of the Celanese facility, and does not go off-site.  Although this scenario was not considered to be more likely than the formaldehyde worst case scenario, it was chosen since other more likely scenarios would result in smaller contained spill areas, none of  which would go off-site.  A Formaldehyde Evaporating Pool Dispersion Model was used for these calculations.  This model, which has been experimentally validated, was used to account for the unique behavior of formaldehyde solutions.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented a Program Level 3 Prevention Program for all three covered chemicals, as required by the RMP rules, and in accordance with US EPA and OSHA requirements.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any "
