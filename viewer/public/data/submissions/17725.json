Through training local emergency\nresponders and employees.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release to people and the environment.\nThe DeLong Company is a member of the Fertilizer 100.  Meaning they are one of the largest 100 fertilizer dealers in the nation and one of the biggest in Wisconsin.  They employ more than 85   people company wide.  There are actually five divisions in The DeLong Co., Inc. Chick DeLong is in charge of feed. Bo DeLong is in charge of DeLco Transport. Steve Quade is in char of the seed division and David DeLong.  President is in charge of fertilizer and chemicals. The primary activity at the facility is the storage, distribution and application of anhydrous ammonia for stateline are farmers. The maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\nWORST-  CASE\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank or tank car released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 150,000 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent of capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE\n\nA\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history or the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.41 miles.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements\" for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K61.1 published by the American National Stan"
