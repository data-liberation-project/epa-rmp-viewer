This standard is often referred to as the risk management program rule.  The facility is covered by the rule because it processes anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory thresholds.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity.  \n\n\n\nAccording to the risk management program rule, covered facilities must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA with updates every five years.  The covered facilities must also revise and update the RMP when certain events occur, such as the addition of a new process containing a regulated substance above its threshold quantity.  The RMP must include registration information, a summary of the risk management program, and a certification statement.  The RMP will be made available to the public.  The purpose of this project was to compile the information and materials necessary to submit an updated RMP to include the methane biogas process.\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving anhydrous ammonia.  The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumed that 14,037 pounds of ammonia was released to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  This scenario assumes that both storage tanks rupture at the same time.  The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's RMP Comp software program.  The distance at which the ammonia concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 1.6 miles.   It was further determined that within 1.6 miles of the facility there is a population of 50 people (based on Landview Census 2000 Population Estimator).  The public receptor"

No environmental receptors are within the area.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario examined a release of ammonia resulting from a failure of the largest of the 2 storage tanks.  In this scenario, 7,921 pounds of ammonia are released over a 10-minute period.  The distance to the regulatory endpoint was calculated to be 1.2 miles.  The population within 1.2 miles of the facility was determined to be 27.  The public receptors identified within 1.2 miles of the facility are residences only (11 housing units).  No environmental receptors are within the area.  \n\n\n\n"
