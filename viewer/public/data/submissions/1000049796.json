If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Hermon, ME Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We do not have an onsite fire brigade.  Our onsite employees are trained to fight incipient-stage fires only and then evacuate and assist the local fire department with propane technical knowledge and assistance.\r\n\r\nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG primarily for distribution directly to our wholesale customers via bobtail delivery and transport.  A portion of the product from this site is distributed to our network of smaller company owned terminals via transport loads.  The facility consists of two 60,000 gallon tanks and is serviced by 30,000 gallon railroad cars, awaiting offload.\r\n\r\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 60,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter pipe, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. \r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. \r\nWe have never had an accident at this location involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Hermon, ME Fire Dep"
