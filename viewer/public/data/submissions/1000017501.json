      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 51 East 1st Street in Superior, WI on the waterfront of the Superior Bay.  The main facility houses two independent treatment plants. The main treatment plant is an activate sludge facility designed to handle all dry weather flows up to 7.6 million gallons per day (MGD) with a peak daily flow of almost 10 MGD. The plant process includes phosphorus removal, screening, grit removal, primary treatment, secondary treatment, anaerobic digestion of solids, and disinfection. Sludge is treated by anaerobic digestion followed by belt filter press dewatering.  The other treatment plant is CSTP No. 2. It  is used to handle high rates of flow that exceed the main plant's design capacity, such as in the spring when snow melting occurs or during major rain events. This facility has a 50 million gallon aerated storage basin and is designed to contain a ten-year storm.  CSTP 2 can treat 25 MGD of combined wastewater with a peak pumping capacity of 60 MGD.\n\nThe elevation of the plant is lower than that of the surrounding homes and highways.  The plant is manned with one operator 24 hours a day. Between the hours of 7 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday there is a potential of 40 employees on site. The plant area is fenced with an entry gate.  The on duty operational personnel have direct radio communications with the Douglas County Emergency Communications Center. A land line and a cell phone are also available.  \n\nThe plant has four chlorine containers, one-ton each, on site at all times.  Two chlorine containers are in use and are located in a room constructed with concrete floor, concrete block and brick walls, and an aluminum ceiling.  Two containers are in storage and are located in an unheated, garage area with a concrete floor and aluminum walls and ceiling.   There are two entrances to each area.  A chlorine leak detector is located in each area with alarms wired into the plant operator's control room. "

All are located in a building with a concrete floor and aluminum walls and ceiling.   There are two entrances to this area.  A sulfur dioxide leak detector is located in this area with alarms wired into the plant operator's control room.  \n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst case scenario was calculated using a model scenario in the EPA Guidance document Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants. It assumes a total loss of two full interconnected one-ton cylinders.  This would occur on a day with an atmospheric stability of F and a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  The calculated distance to the endpoint is a circle with a radius of 1.9 miles.\n\nThis scenario does not take into account the mitigating factors at the City of Superior WWTP.  The chlorine cylinders are housed inside a concrete block room when interconnected.  The wall structure would restrict the dispersion of the gas.  The cylinders in the storage building are not connected together.  For both tanks to rupture at the same time, a fire or explosion would need to occur.  The storage building is constructed of non-flammable materials, and no flammables are allowed in the building.  There are chlorine alarms in both the chlorinator room and the storage building.  \n\nThe likelihood of this scenario actually happening is quite remote.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIO:\n\nThe alternative scenario was calculated using a model scenario in the American Water Works Association's book Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants.  This scenario assumes a release occurs from a one-ton cylinder due to a bad connection or valve failure. The release is restricted to the 5/16-inch diameter valve body opening.  Assuming a 60-minute duration, the total escaped gas would be 317 lbs.  This corresponds to a circle with a"

There is the possibility of the valve being damaged during change-out of the cylinders or off-loading the cylinders from the supplier.  However, even this occurrence would be quite rare.\n\nCHLORINATION/DECHLORINATION SYSTEM\n\nThe chlorine is dispensed via a vacuum system, which will shut off the flow of chlorine in the event of a loss of vacuum.  \n\nStaff is trained regularly to fully understand the safety and health hazards of chlorine and the chlorine processes they work with.  Training for sulfur dioxide will be added in 2012.\n\nThe City of Superior WWTP has instituted a preventative maintenance program with checklists outlining things to observe, record, and adjust.  Every two years, a licensed technician services the chlorination system and equipment maintenance training is provided to all operational staff.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Superior WWTP complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  This comprehensive plan covers all aspects of dealing with a hazardous chemical such as chlorine.\n\nThe major objective of our process safety management of chlorine and sulfur dioxide is to prevent unwanted releases, which could expose employees and others to serious hazards. Our process safety management program applies a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements which impact the process are all considered in the evaluation. Our process safety management is a proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures or equipment.\n\nOur process safety plan incorporates employee participation, proce"

While removing a regulator, a small amount of chlorine gas escaped due to a malfunctioning heater on the drip lag. Several operator were exposed for a brief time, with one seeking medical attention a week later due to respiratory problems. He missed two weeks of work before being release to return to full duty.\n\nThe heater was replaced and the new SOP involves checking the temperature of the drip lag before removal.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Superior WWTP has adopted a set of emergency response procedures to address a full array of events.  Responses are defined for fires, explosions, extended power failure, medical emergencies, flooding, loss of water, natural gas leak, methane leak, chlorine gas leak, sulfur dioxide gas leak, bomb threats, etc.  These procedures include floor plans for all of the buildings at the plant and evacuation routes from every room are defined.\n\nEach scenario lists the names and phone numbers of the supervisory personnel or outside responders to be notified.  The tasks required are identified as are the responsible employees.\n\nThe City of Superior WWTP has worked with the Douglas County Emergency Response Coordinator to develop an emergency response plan to be used in the case of an emergency requiring evacuation of Superior residents.  This plan was also sent to the City of Duluth.\n\nThe Superior Fire Department will be the responder in the case of a chlorine leak acting in the role of the Regional Hazmat Response Team.

The change is expected to be completed in late fall. All gaseous chlorine and sulfur dioxide will be removed from the premises at that time. A liquid chlorine solution will then be used only as a backup when the UV system is down.\n\n"
