      "SummaryText": "The Regional Sterilization facility utilizes ethylene oxide for sterilizing medical devices manufactured by multiple divisions within the C.R. Bard Corporation.  We pruchase the ethylene oxide from Arc Chemical (Balchem Corporation) in DOT-5P drums containing 400 pounds per drum.  Each drum is pressurized with nitrogen to maintain the ethylene oxide in a liquid state.  We have implemented specific operating procedures to define the receipt, storage, usage and return of each DOT-5P drum.  These drums are located in 2 locations within the facility.  (1) Drum Storage Area: contains potentially 32 drums  (2) Drum Manifold room: contains a total of 8 drums.\n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding our use of ethylene oxide.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to first notify the City of Covington Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Any release that occurs above the reportable quantity of 10 pounds is communicated to the National Response Center and Georgia Environmental Protection Division.\n\nOur facility successfully operates under OSHA's Process Safety Management Program for the covered process, with no current plans to change our safety processes or procedures."
