As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Oklahoma State Police, Oklahoma Gas and Electric, and St. Mary\u0092s Regional Medical Center. The KFE Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions. A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials. The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\u0095\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u0095\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u0095\tThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipme"

These high standards include:\n\u0095\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u0095\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u0095\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u0095\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nKFE is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Part of this program has involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u0095\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\n\u0095\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\n\u0095\tTesting and Inspection of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity Program. \n\u0095\tLocating emergency shutdown buttons at the loading areas that can be activated in case of an ammonia release.\n\u0095\tProviding level indication on storage tanks and bullets to reduce the risk of overfilling.\n\u0095\tProviding a means of fire and or vapor suppression by locating fire monitors throughout the facility.\n\u0095\tImplementing procedur"

KFE\u0092s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nKFE produces anhydrous ammonia, urea fertilizer, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.\n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of two ammonia units, two urea production units, and a UAN unit. Ancillary units include a carbon dioxide pipeline compressor station and a hydrogen recovery unit (HRU). The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia. Ammonia is used along with carbon dioxide to produce solid urea fertilizer in the urea production units. Urea Formaldehyde is injected into the process to produce granulated urea. UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia. DEF is formed by combining urea solution with demineralized water. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (chlorine is used as a water treatment chemical in cooling towers and tertiary water treatment unit) are the only toxic sub"
