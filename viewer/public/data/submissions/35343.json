In accordance with U.S. EPA \n\nregulation 40 CFR 68, the U.S. EPA has identified quantities for 140 toxic or flammable \n\nsubstances that require a facility to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule when \n\nunit inventories exceed threshold quantities.  The RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit \n\ninventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA \n\napproved chemical release prevention program.  In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP \n\ncovered facilities to update its Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) every five (5) years or six (6) \n\nmonths after an RMP reportable incident.  Union Carbide Texas City Operations initially \n\nsubmitted its RMPlan in June 1999.  In compliance with 40 CFR 68, Union Carbide Texas City \n\nOperations is submitting the five (5) year update to its initial RMPlan submittal.\n\nSince Union Carbide Texas City Operation's initial submittal in June 1999, Units 81 (OXO) and 82 \n\n(FARM) have reduced RMP chemical inventories to below threshold quantities.  As a result, these \n\nunits have been removed from the current RMPlan.  In addition, Unit 85 (#3 Olefins) has been \n\ndecommissioned and the majority of chemical inventories have been reduced below the \n\nthresholds, resulting in the removal of those inventories from the RMPlan.\n\n\n\nUnion Carbide Texas City Operations currently holds the following RMP-regulated substances \n\nabove threshold quantities:\n\n\n\nEthyl ether - CAS No. 60-29-7    \n\n2-Methylpropene - CAS No. 115-11-7\n\nIsopropyl chloroformate - CAS N"

Offsite consequence analyses are \n\nessential in identifying potential hazards of accidental releases.  The offsite consequence \n\nanalysis (OCA) comprises 2 elements, a worst case scenario and an alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\n\n\nOffsite consequence analyses for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) were conducted using the \n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines.  The \n\nRMP sets forth specific criteria that must be incorporated in modeling the worst-case scenarios.  \n\nThe EPA defines a WCS as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a \n\nspecified endpoint.  As defined by the rule, the endpoint for a toxic substance is a specified \n\nconcentration, while for flammables it is a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion \n\n(VCE).\n\n\n\nThe scenarios for Union Carbide Texas City Operations were calculated using the EPA OCA \n\nLook Up Tables.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and \n\nmanage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures \n\nwas taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS) assess the potential hazards that are more realistic than \n\nworst-case scenarios and are designed to assist in the development of emergency response \n\nplans.  EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines were used in modeling the \n\nalternative release scenarios.  As required, alternative release scenarios"
