Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The Mapleton location became part of Western Iowa Coop on December 15, 1998.  Prior to then, it was a Terra Industries facility.\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nWestern Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OAHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  In addition, we comply with all applicable federal (EPA), state and local requirements.\n\nOur ammonia systems are protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves,  relief valves, barries, manual and emergency shutoff valves.  All main storage valves and hose end valves are locked when n"

Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guidelines in the ANSI Standards.  When repairs are necessary to valves or pumps, a professional contractor is hired. \n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually,  whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questions.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos and on the job training.  Topics covered in this training include;  safety, operating procedure for plant startup, plant shutdown, filling a  nurse tank, unloading a transport,  emergency shutdown and startup after emergency shutdown.\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History\n\nWestern Iowa Coop, Mapleton Iowa  has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n-\n6.The Emergency Response Program.\n\nIn the event of an emergency,  it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to insure that they are familiar and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to insure that our community has a strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.\n\nWestern Iowa Coop has:\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and Community Right to Know information as required under SARA Title II (EPCRA).\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Western Iowa Coop.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional new specific anhydrous ammonia or propane recommen"
