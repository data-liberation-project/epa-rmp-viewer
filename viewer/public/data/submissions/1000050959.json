The RMP is required per the provisions of Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), because chlorine is used in the WWTP process in a quantity exceeding the 2,500 pound threshold listed in 40CFR 68.130.\r\n\r\nThe RMP identifies processes from which a potential chlorine release may occur.  In addition, the RMP describes the practices that are being used to reduce the likelihood of accidents and communicates compliance with the terms and conditions of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions set forth in 40CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nProcess safety and emergency response procedures have been implemented at the DistrictA\u00bfs WWTP to minimize or eliminate the impacts from emergencies and/or accidents.  Emergency response plans are fully reviewed and supported by the DistrictA\u00bfs management and the RMP coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe DistrictA\u00bfs WWTP is a sewage treatment plant that treats raw sewage to secondary effluent standards.  Chlorine is used at the DistrictA\u00bfs WWTP to disinfect the effluent prior to discharge. The chlorine is stored as a liquid under pressure in two one-ton cylinders.  There are no other chemicals stored at the site above the threshold quantities listed in 40CFR 68.130.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe potential for discharges of hazardous substances from this facility is minimal.  The DistrictA\u00bfs WWTP strictly adheres to good housekeeping, materials management practices, and training practices in order to prevent incidents.  Al"

Materials and equipment necessary for prompt spill clean-up are kept on-site.  \r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History:\r\nThe facility has not experienced a significant release, spill, or leak of any toxic pollutant, or hazardous material, or experienced an injury as result of a release in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nAll aspects of the Emergency Response Program have been coordinated with the Salt Lake County Fire Department.  If a release occurs, employees have been trained to take corrective and clean-up actions and notify the RMP coordinator so that he can determine if the spill should be reported to the appropriate agency. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nMonthly meetings are held with all employees to review and improve existing safety procedures."
