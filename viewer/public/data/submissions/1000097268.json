Our safety strategy revolves around our \"Do It Right\" value and permeates our business in three key ways:\n\n\n\n-Robust systems that provide a clear, repeatable direction toward excellence.\n\n-Superior performance that aligns effective and efficient EHS activities with operations.\n\n-Engaged culture that empowers consistent behaviors that drive toward excellence.\n\n\n\nCF Industries works closely with emergency responders and other local officials to develop detailed emergency response plans that extend beyond our physical plants.\n\n\n\nII) Port Neal Nitrogen Facility and the regulated substances handled: \n\n\n\nPort Neal Nitrogen Facility manufactures anhydrous ammonia, Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN) and granular urea. Intermediates in the manufacture of these products include Nitric Acid, Urea solutions, and Ammonium Nitrate solutions.  The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are Anhydrous Ammonia and Syngas.\n\n\n\nIII) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe Port Neal Nitrogen Facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with all of the accidental release and chemical-specific prevention requirements as set forth in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68. This facility is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following summarizes the elements of the release and chemical-specific prevention that are in place at our facility:\n\n\n\n-Process safety information that is accurate and up to date;\n\n-Well-trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel;\n\n-Written operating procedures;\n\n-Mechanical integrity procedures for process equipment inspections and qua"

One of the technicians opened the calibration chamber to verify the level float was all the way up. Ammonia vapor was released from the chamber and the technician was exposed to some of the vapor. The technicians reported the incident to the control room and Operations immediately began the process to close the isolation valves. The technician exposed to the ammonia vapor was transported by emergency services to an area hospital for evaluation and treatment. Required agency notifications were made for the release which was calculated to be 917 pounds of ammonia vapor.  There were no off-site impacts.\n\n\n\nV) The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nIn accordance with a June 14, 2018 determination by EPA Region 7, the Port Neal Nitrogen Facility is designated as a \"non-responding\" facility, and the information specified in Section 9. Emergency Response section of the RMP is based on such designation. Notwithstanding, the Port Neal Nitrogen Facility has an extensive emergency response program with a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determinin"

The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\n\n\n\n\nVI) Planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nRigorous training, drills, audits, cooperation with emergency responders and local officials, recognition programs and participation in industry safety initiatives help keep our focus on what it takes to \"Do It Right.\" Through our ongoing commitment to make our facility as safe as possible for employees, contractors, the community, and the environment, we are always continuously improving our systems and practices.\n\n"
