      "SummaryText": "1.  The Facility Policy\r\n\r\n  The management and employees of HERITAGE FS, INC. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Newton County LEPC, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information.\r\n\r\n  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The storage and handling system consists of 2 storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing, and several nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\n  a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .84 miles.\r\n\r\n  b.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint(point of despersion to 200 ppm) is .1 miles.\r\n\r\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n  This facility complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., as adopted by state regulatio"

Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\n  a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\r\n  -have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\r\n  -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or  \r\n   environmental damage.\r\n\r\n6.  The emergency response program.\r\n\r\n  The facility has:\r\n  a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\r\n  b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA\r\n     Title III (EPCRA).\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the local fire department and LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and the LEPC.\r\n\r\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\n  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
