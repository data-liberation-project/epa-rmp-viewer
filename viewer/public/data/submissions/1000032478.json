A member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and an ISO 9001:2008 registered company that has been in business since 1916.\r\n\r\nBulk commodity chemicals are repackaged into smaller containers such as drums and totes. Blending and packaging products per customers requests, Acid Products serves numerous industries including; automotive, electronic, aerospace, food and drug, cosmetics, cleaning, and those involved with water treatment.\r\n\r\nRaw materials that are used in everyday household items such as; nail polish remover, bleach, vinegar, soft drink formulations, and even some that are used in treating swimming pools.\r\n\r\nSome chemicals arrive in concentrated form before being diluted (i.e., adding water). In this concentrated form, such products present increased hazards and regulatory scrutiny.
