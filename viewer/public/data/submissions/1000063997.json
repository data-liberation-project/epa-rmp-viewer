This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nSKW Quab thrugh Evonik has a nine-point policy guiding the accidental release prevention program. These are:\n\n\n\n1) Use applicable design safety codes and standards as the basis for design, construction, operation, and maintenance in our facilities.\n\n2) Evaluate facilities, equipment and processes for safety and health concerns.\n\n3) Use multiple safeguards to provide layers of protection in the design, construction and operation of facilities, in order to prevent a single failure from escalating into a catastrophic event.\n\n4) Document the safety and health evaluation.\n\n5) Inspect and evaluate process equipment against the design specifications.\n\n6) Maintain current and complete documentation of the process and equipment throughout the lifetime of the process.\n\n7) A Management of Change (MOC) procedure to control minor changes to process technology, operation and maintenance that may affect the safety of the process.\n\n8) Review all changes to process equipment, procedures and practices to ensure the continued safety of employees and facilities.\n\n9) Develop inspection and maintenance programs that ensure the continued integrity of facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nSKW Qaub Mobile"

The  primary production area produces  product Quab in a continuous production schedule, operating 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe prevention program used by the facility is consistent with the Occupational, Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Standard. The standard includes management systems elements involving safety information, hazard evaluations, operating procedures, employee training, contractor programs, mechanical integrity, pre-start up safety reviews, incident investigations, safe work practices and emergency response.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of chemical specific prevention steps used at the facility including release detection equipment, release containment, and release control equipment.\n\n\n\nb. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES INVOLVED.\n\n\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: Epichlorohydrin CAS # 106-89-8, a toxic and the potential for a flammable release of trimethylamine CAS# 75-50-3, resulting in a fire or explosion.\n\n\n\nc. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nSKW Quab through Evonik Degussa maintains a written emergency response program.  We have a \"One Plan \" that comprehensively describes the response program at SKW Quab. \n\n\n\nd. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSKW Quab has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. We have no incidents in the last five years that meet the RMP reporting requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\ne. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\n  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is "

      "SummaryText": "accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid, medical treatment, evacuation plans, and notification of local emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for SKW Quab is coordinated Thru Evonik with the Mobile Fire Department as  a reserve and the Emergency Management Agency (EMA) as a supplement agency for area wide notifications.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  SKW Quab has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Evonik conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nf. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSKW Quab resolves all findings from process hazard analysis, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned: increase process controls & modify procedures.  Each event and depending on the cause and nature of a release facility wide changes to the handling, storage and equipment or review operational procedures including operators training and implementation can be  involved or may be changed to address the event and reduce the potential for re-occurrence.\n\n"
