              "Description": "Liquid bromine is utilized as a raw material to create brominated vegetable oil in a batch reaction process.  The liquid bromine is received by tank truck and unloaded into a glass-lined 2,000 gallon bulk storage tank. The liquid bromine is metered from the storage tank to the chemical reactor by gravity. The bromine is completely reacted in the process (so after the reaction there is no free bromine remaining). A scrubber is used in the off-loading process to capture any fumes from tank venting. The whole process is contained within concrete containment. The storage tank has separate containment that is partially filled with water to provide a water seal if any bromine leak occurred (Bromine will qucikly sink to the bottom of the containment due to its high density). The process is controlled by a distributive control system with safety interlocks. The process falls under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The process is included in the plant's PSM and RMP plans.  ",

      "SummaryText": "American Chemical Service, Inc., (ACS), is a specialty chemical manufacturer located in Northwest Indiana in the county of Lake. ACS modifies vegetable oils using chemical reactors to make useful products. To make these products ACS uses hazardous chemicals, such as bromine and flammable solvents. ACS has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) in accordance with the guidelines and recommendations of the National Response Team.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the ICP is to minimize hazards to human health and to protect the environment from fires, explosions, spills or a toxic gas release of hazardous materials.  The ICP manual contains procedures, instructions, data, methods, tables, forms and general assistance for the operation of the production facilities at American Chemical Service (ACS) during other than normal operations.  This manual is a part of the ACS Quality System that is designed to produce high quality products that meet customer requirements.\n\n\n\nACS has completed a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) and a Risk Management Program (RMP). The PSM and RMP are a portion of the ICP. The accidental release prevention programs and policies along with the emergency response policies are addressed and included in the ICP, PSM and RMP.\n\n\n\nACS has a site specific Safety and Health Plan for its facility. Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices are also addressed in this program, however, to a lesser degree than they are addressed in the ICP.\n\n\n\nACS has identified and trained three emergency coordinators whose responsibility is to proactively respond to releases or potential releases of hazardous substances on site and/or other off site releases that may be affecting the facility. At least one of these individuals can be reached twenty-four (24) hours a day. These individuals also are members of the PSM and RMP planning and audit committees.\n\n\n\nACS has had no accidental releases in the last five years. "
