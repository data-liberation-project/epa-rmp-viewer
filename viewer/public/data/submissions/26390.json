If an emergency should occur, it is our policy to notify the\nRiceville Fire Dept. and other local law enforcement, and request they respond to the emergency.  Our facility has three trained firemen on staff as well as two retired firemen.  The two retired firemen are in\nkey management positions.  Therefore, they have a general understanding of what has to be done to \ncontrol an ammonia emergency.  Our Vice-President/Manager takes control of any emergency situation we may encounter.  He notifies the specific authorities that need to be involved.  Our facility requires NH3 training for any new employee who may be asked to handle ammonia.  We also have yearly training in anhydrous ammonia proper procedures.       \n\nThis facility is a local elevator that handles grain, seed, fertilizer, and chemicals.  Our fertilizer/chemical department offers anhydrous ammonia for resale.  The NH3 site is located at the edge of town with minimumal residences beside it.  (Only on two sides of the property.)   The storage amount of this product consists of one 30,000 gallon tank and the associated piping, valves, pump, and other equipment.  It also has numerous nurse storage tanks that can store up to 192,000 pounds (85% capacity) of ammonia.  The site is very visible and adequate security measures have been implemented to monitor thefts.  \n\nOur worst case scenario is failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85% capacity.  (The greatest amount allowed by company admininstrative controls.)  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint of a leak would be 4.4 miles.  If a leak should occur, several private homes, businesses, and the golf course would be affected.  The school, nursing home, and county park area would also be affected if allowed to reach the maximum area"

      "SummaryText": ".  The area involved could have a population of up to 800 residents.  \n\nOur general accidental release and prevention program consists of several daily checks and an evening observation of the site.  The ammonia system was designed, installed, and is maintained in accordance with state and local regulations.  Our NH3 training for employees meets OSHA criteria.  This facility complies with accident prevention rules and all applicable state and/or local codes.     \n\nThe five year facility history is very good.  We have never had an accident or emergency involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death or personal injury.  There haven't been any evacuations or property damage resulting from our site.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia plant, it is our policy to notify the Riceville Fire Department and the local LEPC.  We have discussed this matter with the fire department and several members of the department have inspected our ammonia plant.  Howard County LEPC is also aware of our site plans.  \n\nAt this time, we have no scheduled safety improvement plans."
