Anhydrous ammonia is introduced into a mixing reactor on a weight basis where it is combined with water, powdered chelates, powdered metal oxides, and industrial acids and bases to produce agricultural fertilizers for farm use.          \r\n\r\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\r\n   \r\nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards           \r\nInstitute Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia \r\nK61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2.1 for design, construction, and \r\nmaintenance of the process equipment.  The Facility also has a Process Safety  Program \r\nthat dovetails the RMP. The Facility tries to minimize the amount of ammonia held or \r\nstored at the facility through management judgment. All employees involved with the \r\nhandling of ammonia are trained in their duties. The Facility continues to review and look \r\nfor means to improve operating and best management practices for increased safety. \r\n\r\nIV. The Five Year Accident History:\r\n       \r\nThere have been no incidents that resulted in or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of ammonia in the past five years.  There have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property \r\ndamage at the Facility.  \r\n         \r\nTo the best of our knowledge, no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \r\nproperty damage, or environmental damage has occurred due to the operation of this \r\nfacility.\r\n\r\nBibliography / References:\r\nTechnical Inc. prepared for NIOSH, HAZOP of  Anhydrous Ammonia Use in \r\nAgricultural 1991.\r\n\r\nClements Associates, Inc., Fairfax, VA;  Health Effects for Ammonia, prepared for The \r\nFertilizer Institute.\r\n\r\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  Chemical Emergency Preparedness and \r\nPrevention Advisory A\u00bf Ammonia, September 1991 Os"

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nMicroSource, LLC\r\nShakopee, MN.\r\n\r\nI.    The Facility Policy:\r\n\r\nThe management and  employees of  MicroSource, LLC are committed to \r\nthe prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local responders are \r\nencouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \r\nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and from time to time include \r\nsections of the management plan in those meetings.  If an accidental release should occur, \r\nthe facility is prepared to work with local emergency responders, and other authorities to \r\nmitigate any release, and to minimize the impact of a release on the population and \r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nII.   Facility Information:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming \r\ncommunity in the area. Anhydrous ammonia, here after referred to as ammonia, is \r\nreceived, stored, and used in the production of non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solutions. \r\nAmmonia is an important source of nitrogen for agricultural crops during the spring and \r\nfall of the year.\r\n \r\nThe maximum quantity that can be stored at the facility's two stationary storage tanks is approximately 206,000 \r\npounds.  The typical method of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing approximately \r\n40,000 pounds or occasionally by railcar containing approximately 158,000 pounds. From time to time the facility receives ammonia trucks to use in the \r\n10-34-0 batch process.  Ammonia is unloaded through a transfer system approved by the State of Minnesota Ag department.  \r\n\r\nThe 10-34-0 fertilizer production process (discussed above)is subcontracted to a mobile T-reactor fertilizer production company.  This process utilizes anhydrous ammonia stored in Gavilon's 30,000 gallon ammonia tank in combination with superphosphoric acid to create 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer.  Once the fertilizer is produced it is transferred to a bulk storage tank for storage w"
