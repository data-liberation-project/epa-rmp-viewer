      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Kettle-Lakes Cooperative, Cedar Grove, Wisconsin facility are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with emergency responders to provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe have the following regulated substances present at our facility.\n\n          Substance:  Propane\n          Maximum Inventory:  102,000 pounds \n          Exceeds 40 CFR Part 68 Threshold:  Yes\n\n          Substance:  Anhydrous Ammonia\n          Maximum Inventory:  124,000 pounds\n          Exceeds 40 CFR Part 68 Threshold:  Yes\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nThe following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for propane involves a catastrophic release from the propane storage vessel.  The scenario involves the release of 102,000 pounds of propane forming a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.4 miles is obtained corresponding to an overpressure of 1 psi from the explosion.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for propane as well.  The scenario involves the release of 7,500 pounds of propane  over 5 minutes (1,500 p"

      "SummaryText": "ounds per minute).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for andydrous ammonia involves a catastrophic release from the storage vessel.  The scenario involves the release of 124,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 3.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for ammonia as well.  The scenario involves the release of 125 pounds of ammonia over 1 minute during a pull away of the piping while filling the tank.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l is 0.1 miles.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention program requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
