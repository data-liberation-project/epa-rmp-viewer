Propane (odorized) is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Danby Passing Siding facility in amounts above threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Ray Energy. These high standards include:\n\n?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n?    Correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Danby Passing Siding Facility does not operate under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since the facility is normally unmanned and remote. However, they do operate under the require"

Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety will help avoid any serious chemical release accidents. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Danby Passing Siding Facility within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Danby Mt Tabor Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the County Regional Planning Commission. The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?    The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n?    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n?    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be"
