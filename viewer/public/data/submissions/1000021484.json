This document includes Process Safety Management as required by OSHA. Filemon Olvera, a Project Manager for CH2M HILL OMI, is the responsible official at the facility. \n\nThe City of Weslaco Water Treatment Plant is located at the southeast corner of the intersection of Mile 5 West & Mile 9 North, Weslaco, Hidalgo County, Texas (north 26.184579 latitude and west -097.990300 longitude). Six one-ton containers of chlorine are stored in the facility.  Two of them are connected to the system at one time.  The facility is staffed 24-hours a day and operators check the chlorination building daily. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in the office located approximately 50 feet north of the chlorination building.\n\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release sce"

The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of the Chlorine to the air. The 4,000 pounds worst-case release quantity selected represents the greatest amount held by interconnected vessels. The RMP*Comp32 results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) as a result of a 10-minute release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine is 1.9 miles. The total potentially affected population with the entire area of the circle is estimated at 19,580 persons. \n\nOne alternative scenario was selected for the offsite consequence analysis. The scenario selected involves the failure of the regulator connections.  This failure results in the release of the entire contents of the containers over a period of 15 minutes. This is equivalent to a release rate of 267 pounds of chlorine per minute. The RMP*Comp32 dispersion modeling results indicate that 0.3 miles is the maximum distance for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) as a result of a 15 minute release of 267 pounds of chlorine per minute. The total potentially affected population within the entire area of the circle is estimated at 680. \n\nPopulation estimates are based on 2000 U.S. Census Bureau data from LandView&reg;5 and MARPLOT. The Weslaco population has increased more than 30% in the past decade, so the potentially affected population should be higher than the numbers used in this report.  Most of the growth in Weslaco has occurred outside of the 1.9-mile radius, therefore, although the population has increased, it has not increased 30% within the area in question. \n\nA search of MARPLOT Satellite and Topographic maps did not identify any offsite impacts of environmental receptors within the endpoint.

Weslaco Water Treatment Plant personnel employed the HAZOP technique to conduct a Process Hazard Analysis. They discussed each question and recorded their answers. After answering the questions, they discussed the adequacy of the existing safeguards and recommendations for additional safeguards. The staff finished the Process Hazard Analysis with an equipment inspection. All equipment was inspected during the Process Hazard Analysis. The Process Hazard Analysis will be updated at least once every five years.  \n\nWeslaco Water Treatment Plant ensures that each employee presently operating the process, and each employee newly assigned to these processes have been trained or tested successfully in the operating procedures listed above that pertain to their duties. Annual refresher training provided to each employee operating the chlorination process ensures that the employee understands and adheres to the current operation procedures of the process.\n\nThe Weslaco Water Treatment Plant emergency procedure addresses potential emergencies that can reasonably be expected to occur at the facility. The emergency response procedures consider dangers within the plant that may affect employees as well as dangers outside of the plant that may affect the public or the environment.
