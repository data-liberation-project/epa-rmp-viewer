The Facility Policy\n\n\n\n         The owners, management, and employees of Krown, Inc. dba Hi-Yield Products are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an\n\n         accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the \n\n         impact of the release to the people and the environment. A \"Site Safety Coordinator\" is identified and used as an extension of the General Manager for a \"hands-on\"\n\n         manager of the day to day safe working activities, maintain the required regulatory recordkeeping, conduct monthly safety meetings, conduct employee training, and \n\n         act as the location's contact during emergency incidents that are rehearsed biannually. This facility's management and employees are enrolled in a Regulatory \n\n         Management Service that assists in maintaining and administering comprehensive safety and environmental programs, procedures, and training courses.\n\n\n\n2.     Facility Information\n\n\n\n         The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\n\n         Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\n         The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 665,300 pounds in our (4) 30,000 gallon storage tanks and nurse tanks used at this facility. The maximum\n\n         quantity handled in a single operation would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.     The Worst Case Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n\n\n         This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however it is not to be "
