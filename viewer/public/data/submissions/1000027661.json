Written procedures are maintained and are followed by Bayer CropScience Muskegon personnel and contactors that perform work in our processes. The Bayer CropScience Muskegon Emergency Response & Contingency Plan is readily available and includes the immediate and follow-up reporting to federal, state, and local authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the Michigan Department of Natural Resources & Enviroment MDNRE)), the state and local emergency planning centers (LEPC' s), local fire and police departments, and other interested parties. \n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Bayer CropScience Muskegon Site is located 2 miles north of Muskegon, MI.  The site has a total area of 400 acres, which 40 acres are developed.\n\n\n\nBayer CropScience- Muskegon has two listed chemicals that are covered by the RMP rule (Anhydrous Ammonia and n-Propyl Chloroformate).  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a raw material for the production of a herbicide active ingredient Glufosinate Ammonium/\n\n\n\nn-Propyl Chloroformate is used as a raw material in the production of a fungicide active ingredient Propamocarb.  \n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE that this chemical should have been included in our Risk Management Plan when the Propamocarb process was initially started up.  It was apparently overlooked as a RMP chemical so this resubmission includes the chemical n-propyl chloroformate.  The Propamocarb unit that includes the chemical n-propyl chloroformate is a covered process under OSHA's Process Safety Management so all elements were and still are implemented.  n-propyl chloroformate is included in our Emergency Response & Contingency Plan and also in the emergency response trai"

We endorse and maintain an effective process safety management program that requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements which impact the process are all considered in the evaluation. The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the unit process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals are evaluated and strengthened as needed to assure their effectiveness at each level. Ultimately, the major objective of process safety management of hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals which could expose our employees and others to serious hazards.  Elements in the accident prevention program include programs such as: Management of Change, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Mechanical Integrity, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits and Permits To Work for Bayer employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nIn regard to specific chemicals and processes regulated under RMP, the processes subject to the RMP regulation are also subject to OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulation.  OSHA's PSM regulation is intended to prevent potential releases inside the plant and the RMP program is meant to help control or prevent releases which may affect off-site human health or the environment.\n\n\n\nAccidental releases from these processes are prevented by studying the hazards of the"

The processes are periodically evaluated to assess the risk of the operations by current standards and to make improvements where necessary. \n\n\n\nIn addition to skilled operators, the processes are controlled by computerized control systems which monitor and record conditions within the processes and make adjustments accordingly.  In addition to the control systems, several of the processes are equipped with redundant computer safety systems which act to correct or shutdown the processes if certain parameters are exceeded and other process are equipped with direct shutdown controls to achieve similar protection.  All of the processes covered by RMP utilize scrubbers to reduce emissions from the process to minimize releases to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nMaintenance of equipment containing hazardous substances is also a key element in preventing accidental releases. In addition, any changes made to the processes are carefully reviewed prior to implementation to ensure that safety and environmental risks are recognized and addressed.  These changes are managed under the site's Management of Change procedure(MOC).  Finally, while many steps have been taken to prevent accidental releases, in the event of a release, it is investigated to determine the root causes and a corrective action plan is developed and implemented to prevent re-occurrence.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Bayer CropScience Muskegon Site has zero accidental releases from RMP covered processes (Glufosinate Ammonium - anhydrous ammonia and Propamocarb process -n-propyl chloroformate) that meet the RMP reporting criteria during the last five years. \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Bayer CropScience Muskegon site relies on local first responders (i.e.: local fire department and HazMat Team) for assistance.

The Bayer Action Tracking System (BATS) is the electronic tool the Bayer CropScience Muskegon Site uses to document incidents and follow-up actions and it also includes the Management of Change process to manage changes. A SAP Maintenance PM program is used to document and track maintenance on equipment in all processes.  The process to determine applicability to EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM rules has been improved to ensure all requirements are met."
