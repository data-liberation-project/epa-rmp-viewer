The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(1). The Prevention Porgram Elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) System prepared in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and Puerto Rico requirements. The San Juan Chlorine Warehouse Distribution Center store chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, PROSHO and EQB. Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the San Juan Chlorine Warehouse and Distribution Center observes various safety precautions in the storage and distribution of chlorine. The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the San Juan Chlorine Warehouse and Distribution Center and the immediate surrounding areas. Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release as well as a written emergency response program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled                                                                                          \n\n                                                                                                                                   Chlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in containers full with one ton containers or 150 pounds bottels. The maximum inventory of chlorine is 2,418,800 pounds.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program is composed of many elements and its objective is to prevent accidents and protect the human health, the environment and the property.\n\n\n\nEme"

      "SummaryText": "rgency Response Program\n\n\n\nPRASA has an emergency response program. Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warning of any leak. Leak repair kits are maintained on site, and operators are trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur. The emergency response program is coordinated with State Emergency Management Agency  for notification of the public. PRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site; or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPRASA uses Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety. Issues identified from a PHA are then adderessed in PRASA's Prevention Program. Recommendations from th most recent PHA include increasing the elevation of wind socks, evaluation of emergency exits, and control of vehicular traffic inside warehouse."
