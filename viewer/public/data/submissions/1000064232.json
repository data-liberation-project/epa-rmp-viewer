      "SummaryText": "Revision 8.1 Executive Summary\n\nSacramento Regional CSD (Regional San), has instituted a Risk Management Program (RMP) for the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (SRWTP), as required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68. The RMP identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with any Regulated Substance (RS) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities. The program describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees.  The program also describes offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis, defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of RS accidental releases, and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for auditing of program elements and implementation of mitigation measures.  The previous RMP 5 year update was filed in April 2014 with an update submitted in October of 2015 as required by ARP regulations.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe SRWTP treats wastewater collected from the City and County of Sacramento, from the Cities of Folsom, West Sacramento (Yolo County), Elk Grove, Rancho Cordova, and Citrus Heights.  It is located at 8521 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA on 900 acres of a 3,400-acre site between Interstate 5 and Franklin Blvd., south of Meadowview Rd. The remaining 2,500 acres serve as a buffer between the Plant and nearby residential areas. There are approximately 360 full-time employees at this site and multiple contractors on site for the EchoWater Project.  The Plant treats an average of 145 million gallons (mgd) of wastewater per day.  The Plant currently uses chlorine for disinfection but will transition to the liquid form of this chemical by mid 2017. Effective May of 2017, SRWTP transitioned from gaseous s"

      "SummaryText": "ulfur dioxide to liquid sodium bisulfite for de-chlorination. This reduced the SO2 inventory to less than 300 pounds residual in the sulfur dioxide vacuum gas lines (SOV) which will be cleaned and sealed via the SOV Decommissioning Procedure. The Plant continues to maintain chlorine and methane in quantities greater than the Federal/State threshold quantities.  In anticipation of a potential interruption in rail service that was expected in January 1, 2016, due to Positive Train Control (PTC) federal requirements, the SRWTP administratively increased inventory maximum numbers for chlorine and sulfur dioxide railcars.  PTC requirement deadlines were extended and the strike was suspended.  SRWTP never implemented the larger quantity storage use, has removed SO2 from premises and has limited supply of chlorine until the chlorine system can be decommissioned.  These inventory changes are reflected in the ARP registration and HMP chemical inventory. Additionally, methane gas is held in the digester gas system in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine system consists of railcar receiving, liquid chemical withdrawal from railcars, liquid chemical vaporization, gaseous chemical metering and dissolution into water for application to various points in the wastewater treatment process. \n\nSolids removed in the wastewater treatment process are introduced into the  anaerobic digesters at the Plant. Gas consisting of approximately two-thirds methane is produced in the digesters through anaerobic digestion. The digester gas is scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants, stored in low pressure gas holders, and piped to a cogeneration plant where it is used to generate electricity and steam.  Digester gas that cannot be used by the cogeneration plant is flared or optionally used as a fuel source for on site boilers. Most methane is consumed shortly after it is collected; however, the entire potential stored inventory of digester gas "

      "SummaryText": "in the plant must be considered for the purpose of comparison with the Federal threshold quantity. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nIt is the policy of the SRWTP that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and methane be done in a manner that meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  To accomplish this goal, the SRWTP has safety information on chlorine and methane, the processes, and RS equipment and procedures; performed  and revalidated a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed and revalidated an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established  written emergency response program coordinated with local emergency response agencies. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs that have been implemented by the SRWTP are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, engineering controls, and emergency response programs. \n\nThe SRWTP has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program that meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 which is the general accidental release prevention program.  A Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) is used as a management tool for the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS \n\nMany steps to prevent releases of an RS have been identified and implemented since the original RMP submittal.   These include, among other things, use of a gas scrubber system for the chemical building and Plant Emergency Trip Systems (PETs) to effectively isolate the system during an emergency which limits the amount of RS that may be released from "

There are also redundant processes and isolation points in the chemical and gas management systems, and numerous facility-specific operational procedures for the chlorine and digester gas systems.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine, sulfur dioxide, or methane at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nThe SRWTP's Emergency Response Programs applicable to chlorine and methane have been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  Furthermore, the Gas Managment emergency response program was revised in 2012-13 and the chemical handling system emergency response program was revised August of 2015 in close coordination with Cosumnes Fire and Sacramento City Fire Hazmat Departments.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nSRWTP staff continuously strives towards improvements and mitigation measures in the covered process areas. The Management of Change/Pre-Start Up Safety Review (MOC/PSSR) program has been updated and is utilized for change approvals prior to implementation. The Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been re-evaluated with action items made to address deficiencies. The chemical building was further improved in 2016 with the elimination of the chemical vent box system and installation of individual vent gas arrestor scrubber buckets.   All improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analyses or compliance audits, that have been committed to be completed, have been completed or are in progress.  The sulfur dioxide process has been replaced eliminating the SO2 covered process. Planned safety changes include projects such as re-evaluation of digester gas system operation and physical improvements to reduce the likelihood of gas venting, c"
