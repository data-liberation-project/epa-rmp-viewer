EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 68.155\n\n      The City of Melbourne Utility Department (CMUD) operates the Grant Street Wastewater Treatment\n      Facility (GSWWTF) for the City of Melbourne, Florida (City).\n\n\n      1.1 Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies  (a)\n\n            The City GSWWTF accident prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates \n            technologies, procedures and management practices. The City's prevention program compiles          \n            with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk \n            Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR -68, Prevention Program.\n\n         1.1.1 Management System (A)(1)\n                  \n                  The City has a management system in place  which oversees the implementation and on-going \n                  use of the RMP elements. This program, along with other policies, eliminates and/or reduces\n                  the likelihood of a chemical release at the facility.\n\n         1.1.2 Prevention Program Level 3 (A)(2)\n\n                  The City maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program. The\n                  program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3 listed elements and the elements needed\n                  to implement the RMP program. These are retained in the City's Document Control System (DCS).\n\n      1.2 The City's Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handling.\n\n            The City employs fifteen (15)  employees at the facility and in field operations. Chlorine is used\n            in the treatment process.\n\n\n         1.2.1 Site Description\n\n                  The facility has covered chlorine storage. The chlorine distribution system is contained in a \n                  process building. The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include \n                  the bulk chlorine storage and control building and associated vent and exhaust systems.\n\n         1.2.2"
