Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Vogel Agri-Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Fremont County LEPC, and/or any other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3. Worse-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worse-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program. \n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the State of Iowa,  Chapter 43, Fertilizers and Agricultural Lime, 21-43.6(200).  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5. Five - Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan\n\nThe facility has:\n\nA.   A written Action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nB.   Provided "

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\n1.   Within 15 minutes of determining that the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\nThe National Emergency Response Center @ 800-424-8802\n\n2.   Immediately (within one hour) after determining that the amount or release or release would be over 100 pounds, The Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\nThe State Spill Reporting Agency @515-281-8883 (day phone) or 515-281-8694 (after hours phone).\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
