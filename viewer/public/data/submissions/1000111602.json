This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of the regulated substance. The Twinsburg facility is a responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemical, so the site utilizes an Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nAlbemarle stores a maximum of 2,500 gallons of liquid bromine in their storage tank which is filled by their tank trailer. It is then slowly evaporated through an external heat exchanger to gas phase Bromine. The gas phase bromine is then absorbed into various substrates through a contacting/mixing process. The finished product is a dry, chemically stable powder used in the power generation industry to remove air pollutants. A complete safety and containment system is in place for the active bromine portion of the systems. All areas where reactive liquid or vapor bromine are present have complete vapor/liquid isolation capability. Each area has water blanketing capability, and vapor isolation with neutralization capacity through a packed scrubber tower. All bromine areas are automatically alarmed and the scrubber and bromine alarm have power backup for the system.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nAlbemarle has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nAlbemarle maintains a detailed record of pro"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Albemarle maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nAlbemarle has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nAlbemarle carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at Albemarle to manage changes in pro"

Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review [PSSR] [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routinely at Albemarle. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nAlbemarle conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nAlbemarle promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nAlbemarle believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, Albemarle employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nAlbemarle has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Albemarle has a olicy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe Twinsburg facility has not had any RMP accidents within the last five years.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nIn the event of an incident, Albemarle has systems in place to respond quickly. Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis and the facility has a plan in place for evacuations, adequate first aid, and medical treatment and notification of local emergency response agencies. Albemarle coordinates with the Summit County LEPC on an annual basis and completeds field exercises on a regular basis. The facility is a responding facility, and has trained employees to respond in the event of a release of the regulated chemical. Albemarle also utilizes the Summit County LEPC to respond to chemical releases for additional support, as needed.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nThe Albemarle facility has conducted their PHA and audit within the last year and are actively reviewing and completing the action items resulting from these events.\n\nAlbemarle has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.  We believe that the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation, and our commitment to continuous improvement that an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."
