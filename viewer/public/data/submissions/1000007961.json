      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThe City of AllentownA?s Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) uses chlorine, a strong bactericidal agent, to disinfect treated wastewater prior to discharge to the Lehigh River, which protects the riverA?s downstream uses and public health.  While it is the same disinfectant used in most drinking water, before it is mixed with water, chlorine can be extremely hazardous if released to the air.  \n\nAllentown has a firm commitment to the safety obligations and responsibilities associated with storing and using chlorine.  The seriousness and effectiveness of AllentownA?s commitment has been demonstrated in both its unblemished safety record and excellent environmental compliance record.  The steps Allentown takes routinely to ensure the safety within the treatment plant, what could happen if there were an accident, and what procedures would be followed in the event of an emergency are described in the following sections. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of AllentownA?s (COA) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Prevention Program requirements are adhered to.  The central focus of AllentownA?s response policy has always been and will continue to be proactive prevention.  The absence of any emergency due to a chlorine leak at the WWTP demonstrates the success of this approach.\n\nThe WWTP is committed to emergency preparedness and prompt response with trained on-site staff.  The facility has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan (ERP) to handle any potential accidental releases; the ERP is designed to safeguard both individuals on-site and off-site.\n\n\nState of the Art Process and Safety Equipment\n\nThere is a dedicated building for chlorine storage and delivery syste"

      "SummaryText": "ms. Chlorine leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the storage and use areas. There are additional alarms monitoring process conditions.  These alarms are annunciated at the local control panels and at the main operatorsA? control station. In addition to a variety of pressure relief, automatic shut-off and pressure reducing valves the chlorination system also includes an emergency scrubbing system on-site designed automatically operate upon a high concentration alarm inside the building to capture and neutralize any accidental releases of chlorine before it can escape the building.  An ample supply of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs) are located so they are easily accessible in an emergency.  \n\nEntrance to the WWTP is controlled at the driveway off of Union Street by a gate that is only open during normal working hours.  During those hours, visitors and contractors must check-in at the administration building and be approved by WWTP staff prior to going elsewhere in the facility.  The plant is manned 24-hours a day, year round, and there is a centralized alarm system which notifies staff of any problems or intrusions.      \n\n\nFive-year Accident History \n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazards to any individuals at on-site or off-site locations (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the WWTP during the last five years. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCity of Allentown WWTPA?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\nA?Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment as described above.\nA?Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\nA?Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\nA?Comprehensive preventive maintenance program. \nA?Periodic completion of a hazard review of equipment and procedur"

This program has been coordinated with the City of Allentown Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes emergency response procedures and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted at a minimum frequency of every 12 months; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA state-of-the-art emergency mitigation scrubber has been in place for more than 10 years.  A few minor changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified for the chlorine process in 1999, 2004 and 2009 hazard reviews.  The 1999 and 2004 recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented.   Recommendations from the 2009 hazard review and compliance audit will be evaluated and feasible items selected for implementation are expected to be completed by December 2009.  The implementation of these sets of recommendations will further improve the safety of the covered processes. \n"
