The releases that HAT has had in the past 5 years are typically very small releases in nature to the air and do not meet the criteria that is stipulated in the regulations.\n\n\n\nHAT has an extensive emergency response program both within the facility and within the community.  Within the facility there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control, and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with.  The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance.  The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning "

All these plans are reviewed with representatives of the LEPC, State Police, Sheriff's Department, Fire Departments, regulatory agencies and industry.\n\n\n\nHAT is striving on a daily basis to make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  HAT literally has safety and/or environmental training going on almost daily.  Every employee and contractor will attend numerous safety and/or environmental training meetings annually.  HAT and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety and the environment and our success is accomplished by research, innovation and the use of good common sense.\n\n\n\nHAT has performed the offsite consequence analysis per the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subchapter B.  The Worst-Case Toxic scenario is defined as the total release of one of the bulk anhydrous storage tanks.  EPA's RMP*COMP (web version) was utilized to obtain the predicted radius to the toxic endpoint; however, the program is limited to a release of 7,500,000 pounds for ammonia liquified by refrigeration, which is less than the release scenario of 30,000,000 pounds.  Per guidance from the EPA, the endpoint determination was obtained by specifying that the ammonia was liquified under pressure and specifying a release of 30,000,000 pounds as required.   "
