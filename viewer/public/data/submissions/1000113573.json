PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nPSC management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the RMP manual.  \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nRifle Gas Plant is a 50 mmscf/day natural gas dewatering and liquid hydrocarbon extraction facility that is jointly owned constructed by PSC and Source Gas;  the plant is operated by PSC.  The RMP-regulated substances handled at this facility are flammable mixtures and propane.  The flammable mixtures are extracted from the natural gas processed at the plant;  propane is used for refrigeration.  There are four 30,000 gallon liquid hydrocarbon product storage tanks (607,200 pounds) and one 1000 gallon propane tank (5060 pounds).\n\nThe gas processing section and the liquid hydrocarbon storage between the ESD on the inlet of the gas plant (SV 155) and the ESD on the outlet of the gas plant (SV 153) are currently the only portions of the Rifle Gas Plant regulated under the RMP regulation.

However, three PSC operators perform periodic system checks and maintenance at the plant.\n\nPrevention Steps for Liquid Hydrocarbon Product and Propane\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Rifle Gas Plant RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\u00b7 Safety information, which has been collated into the RMP manual located in the Rifle Gas\nPlant control room.\n\u00b7 Hazard Assessment (HAs) - The initial HA for the LPG, drip gas, and propane system was\nconducted in May 1994. HAs have been conducted as well as revalidations every five years. All\nrecommendations from the HAs are addressed in a timely fashion. \n\u00b7 Operating procedures for the facility operations, which are available at the plant\n\u00b7 Training for all plant personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the plant operations\n\u00b7 Maintenance Program for Mechanical integrity the operator computer system to ensure that the system\nequipment is maintained in good and safe working condition.\n\u00b7 Incident investigation procedures for the investigation of any catastrophic (or potentially\ncatastrophic) incident associated with the liquid hydrocarbon product and propane system.\n\u00b7 Compliance audits are conducted at least once every three years to ensure the continued\ncompliance of the Rifle Gas Plant RMP program.\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR"

      "SummaryText": "68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPublic Meeting:  After March 15, 2021, conduct a public meeting within 90-days of any RMP reportable incident resulting in offsite impact(s) - death, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage [40 CFR 68.42(a)].  During the public meeting information to be provided will include information contained in 40 CFR 68.42(b).\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nProcess hazard analysis are conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."
