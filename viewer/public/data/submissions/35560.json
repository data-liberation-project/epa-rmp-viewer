      "SummaryText": "The Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are to maintain safe conditions for base personnel and the inhabitants of the surrounding communities.  The policy is to be enforced through strict compliance with applicable regulations, Chlorine Institute guidelines, physical safeguards, rigorous training, and deployment of adequate resources.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance is chlorine at the wastewater treatment plant. \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response are given the highest priority.  In the event of an accidental release, the emergency response system has the equipment, training, and resources to minimize injury to the public and the environment.  The system is equipped with alarms to monitor for leaks and alert the plant personnel to take corrective action.  The system is also equipped with vacuum regulators, which would stop the supply of chemical at the container, thereby limiting the chemical release to a very small amount.\n\nThere have been no releases from any of the covered processes at NAS Jacksonville for the past five years.  A planned change to improve safety at the stationary source is to switch from chlorine to liquid sodium hypochlorite.  This change has been proposed to be conducted by the utilities privatization contractor upon their assumption of control of the water and wastewater treatment plants."
