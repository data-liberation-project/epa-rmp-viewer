The policy for emergency response is to ensure that all WTP personnel are aware of the procedures for notifying emergency response organizations, such as local fire departments ( Mills River Fire Department and Fletcher Fire Department) and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Hendersonville Water Treatment Plant treats up to 12 MGD of raw water from the Mills River.  Part of the treatment process involves the injection of chlorine, a very common and effective method of controlling coliform and other harmful bacteria.  Chlorine is stored in a room of the treatment plant in 2000 pounds pressurized cylinders and supplied by piping to the water to be treated. \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario.  A complete loss of chlorine from a 2000 lb stroage tank would occur within the chlorine storage room.  Dispersion would be mitigated by the room, but according to the model the chlorine would migrate somewhere within a 2.2 mile radius circle around the plant.  Public and enviromental receptor within the circle that could be adversly affected by the release include residences, schools, a small shopping center and a National Forest.  The population within the circle is estimated to be 4000 people.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario  A loss of 1100 pounds of chlorine would occur within the chlorine storage room as a result of a relief valve failure.  Dispersion would be mitigated by the room, but according to the model the chlorine would migrate somewhere within a 0.4 mile radius circle around the plant. Public and enviromental receptors within the circle that could be adversly affected by the release incl"

The population within the circle is estimated  to be 500 people.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcedures for changing the chlorine cylinders are posted and require two operators to be present.  Chlorine cylinders are to be changed only on the day shift. Chlorine regulators are rebuilt and tested by the manufacture each year.  A spare regulator is on hand at all times.  Chlorine regulators, rotameters, regulators and tubing are inspeced at least once a year and replaced as necessary.  When unloading pressurized cylinders, two operators are to be there during the complete process.  Hoist is tested yearly.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidnets at the Hendersonville Water Treatment Plant in the previous five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM   The WTP is manned on a continuous basis.  In the event of a release of chlorine gas in the chlorine storage room, both audible and visual alarms would sound.  The operator on duty would immediately dial 911 to alert local fire departments, would call the County Fire Marshal who is in charge of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and would contact the Operator in Responsible Charge (ORC) or backup ORC.  WTP operators have received training in hazardous materials spill response and chlorine safety and repair work.  Both the local fire departments and the LEPC have inspected the WTP chlorine storage room.  Depending on the seriousness of the leak, one or more of the following actions would be taken:  1.  WTP Operators would repair the leak themselves.  2.  A trained leak repair crew would be called in from the Skyland Fire Department or the chlorine vendor.   Response time for this would be approximately 1 hour or less.  3.  The surrounding area would be evacuated.  This would be coordinated by the LEPC, who would also handle public notification utilizing emergency vehicles with loudspeakers.  Drills for this type of emergency are conducted at"

In order to maintain this record, WTP personnel will be trained on a regular basis including annual chlorine safety seminars, water plant operator certification courses, and hazardous materials awarness courses.  In addition, all WTP Personnel are required to perform an annual review of the process Safety Management Plan and all process safety information."
