      "SummaryText": "The Woonsocket Regional Wastewater Commission's (WRWC) Accidental Release\nPrevention Policy involves a unified approach that integrates state of the art technologies,\nprocedures and management practices.\n\nFor process ID 1 (Chlorination),  the WRWC utilizes chlorine in its clarification process in order\nto meet its Permit limit of fecal coliform.  The Chlorination System consists of  two (2) banks\nwith three (3) one toncylinders of chlorine each.  There is an automatic switch valve to switch\nover when onebank is empty.  Each chlorine cylinder is equipped with a rapid shut off valve.  This\nsystem provides a rapid closure (3 second response) of chlorine cylinders upon contact closure\nfrom gas detectors and fire alarm.  To make the system safer, a second chlorine gas detector\nwas installed and connected to the cylinders rapid shut off valves controller as a back up in\nthe event of failure of the main chlorine gas detector.  In addition a motorized shut off\nvalve was installed on each chlorine line to the vacuum regulators.  Those valves will be\nactivated upon receiving a signal from the PLC in the event that the chlorine gas detectors\nor the fire alarm are activated.  Total response time from the time of release to complete\nshut down of system is seventeen (17) seconds.  \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios,\nidentified as \"worst-case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined\nby EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum\nquantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified\nfailure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case\nrelease scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled\nby the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected\nby EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Plann"

This conditions was pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount as\na gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint and\nconsideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to\nthe toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the\noffsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst-case scenario was performed using\nthe EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles and an estimate of\nresidential population potentially affected of 28,000 was obtained. \nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the flexible connections (pigtails)\nconnected to three ton-containers, possibly due to an earthquake.  The amount of chlorine\nreleased is 1 lbs., at an average rate over one minute (the duration of the release) of 1 (one)\nlb/min. The estimated toxic endpoint was 0.10 mile with 30 persons effected. Actuation of the\nchlorine detector is an active mitigation measure considered.
