The AMVAC facility at Hannibal,\r\nMO was formally owned and continues to be operated by BASFCorporation . It is considered a Resident Tenant facility at the BASF Hannibal, MO plant (Site). Other than formal company ownership, no other changes in operating procedures or management systems relating to the RMP for ethyl mercaptan at the AMVAC facility (Facility) are planned. AMVAC emphasizes safety for our Facility employees, protection of the neighboring communities, and protection of the environment.  The Facility has been designed to safely manage the chemicals used and produced by our production facility. It is our policy to not only comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations, but also to voluntarily go beyond these requirements to ensure our continued successful and safe operations. We have developed and implemented the following to achieve our goals:\r\n\r\n*Inherently safer process equipment and process control design incorporating safety devices and\r\nsystems needed to properly handle, store or use materials in our processes.\r\n*Well-defined and documented operating procedures and control systems\r\n*An extensive safety, health and process safety management system\r\n*Well-trained production employees coupled to a trained technical staff\r\n*An extensive preventive maintenance and equipment inspection program\r\n*Plant site access is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nIn addition to these preventative programs and as a Resident Tenant at the Site, the Site maintains an emergency response plan and trained personnel and response equipment to be prepared to respond to potential emergencies involving fire, releases of hazardous material, medical emergencies, and confined space rescue.\r\n\r\nThe Site has a working relationship with local emergency response agencies providing them with\r\ninformation on plant operation"

This compound is ethyl mercaptan and is a flammable material. Ethyl mercaptan is used as a raw material to produce agricultural products.\r\nEthyl mercaptan is typically received by railroad tank car (about 165,000 pounds per car). Up to four\r\ntank-cars may be in the receiving area on the Site waiting unloading into the dedicated ethyl\r\nmercaptan storage tank. The maximum total inventory for the four tank cars is 660,000 pounds.\r\nTrained, Site personnel move the tank car to the unloading area using a Trackmobile.\r\nThe railcar is positioned inside a concrete secondary containment system in the unloading area and\r\nis then connected to the ethyl mercaptan storage tank to unload.  The ethyl mercaptan storage tank is located inside a concrete secondary containment system. The mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to manufacture an agricultural product. The total inventory for the storage tank, chemical processing equipment and pipes is about 189,000 pounds. Transportation, unloading, and use of mercaptan are managed under Site operating procedures.\r\n\r\nThe Site has a well-established accident prevention program. The primary purpose of the\r\nprogram is to eliminate those events which have the potential to result in personal injury, property\r\nloss, and environmental or community impact. The secondary purpose of the program is to ensure\r\nreliable and predictable operations. The objective of the program is to eliminate all unexpected\r\nevents. The program consists of four fundamental elements: (1) written procedures;(2) training;(3)\r\nauditing;(4) process reviews or evaluation.  Details for each element include:\r\n\r\n(1) The written procedures include personal health and safety, work practices, equipment operation"

The procedures receive periodic review and are revised as necessary.\r\n\r\n(2) The training element includes job specific safety, emergency response and hazard awareness\r\ntraining. Training plans are specifically developed for various employee groups. The frequency of the training varies within a three-year cycle depending upon the employee group and the topic.\r\n\r\n(3) The auditing activities include both internal and external audits. Internal audits are completed\r\nusing a wide range of Site resources. Site/Facility personnel conduct routine general inspections of plant facilities on a regular basis (e.g. daily/weekly/monthly). Site personnel conduct extended plant-wide audits at a minimum of three-year frequency. These audits include safety, housekeeping, transportation, ergonomics, emergency systems, industrial hygiene, process safety management and mechanical integrity inspections. Corporate and Divison staff, state and federal agencies, insurance companies, etc. conduct external audits.\r\n\r\n(4) Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each manufacturing and related support facilities on a 5-year cycle in accordance with applicable OSHA Process Safety Management regulations and USEPA RMP regulations.  Selected management of change activities also requires a hazard analysis. The analyses evaluate the impact of unexpected events to both in-plant and off-plant receptors.  Five-year accident history: The Facility maintains records of all chemical releases. Our records document that we have had no accidental releases of the RMP listed substance meeting the RMP rule criteria for the past five years.\r\n\r\nThe Site also has a well-established emergency response plan.

The plan's objective is to provide a coordinated response to\r\npotential plant emergencies that could threaten employee health and safety, the local community,\r\nthe environment or plant property.\r\n\r\nThe Site maintains experienced personnel who are fully trained to respond to potential emergencies\r\narising from fires, hazardous material releases, and medical emergencies and confined space\r\nincidents. The various teams are equipped to respond to Facility emergencies. The Facility recognizes\r\nthe potential need to utilize community emergency response agencies during some emergency\r\nsituations. Therefore, Site emergency response teams work closely with members of the Palmyra,\r\nHannibal, Quincy, and Hannibal Rural Fire Departments sharing emergency response information,\r\nconducting information/review meetings, providing emergency response support to the communities for\r\nincidents not related to Facility activities, and in many areas participating in local voluntary response\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nThe Site/Facility has an effective safety program as indicated by its excellent safety performance\r\nrecord. The Facility has implemented effective programs to minimize the potential for off-site releases.\r\nAt this time, there are no specific changes planned for the safety program related to the RMP\r\nactivities. The Site's Leadership Team and Responsible Care Steering Group meet on a regular basis to evaluate performance and to modify and improve Safety and Environmental programs and management systems, as needed."
