      "SummaryText": "Introduction \n\n\n\nThe Santa Clarita Valley Water Agency facility (SCVWA) uses chlorine, a regulated chemical, for disinfection. This Risk Management Program (RMP) plan was originally submitted in June 1999 and revised in June 2004, December 2008, September 2013, February 2017, and January 2022. The plant was expanded between 2009 and 2011. The expansion project included the construction of a new chlorine building and an increase in the maximum inventory of chlorine from 33 to 54 one-ton cylinders. The RMP is summarized below.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe SCVWA facility is located at 27234 Bouquet Canyon Road in Santa Clarita, California and covers 65 acres. SCVWA is provided State Project water stored in Castaic Lake for treatment and distribution. The plant is currently capable of treating 60 million gallons per day (mgd) of water with an additional future capacity of 120 mgd.\n\n\n\nRaw water is first delivered to the pre-ozone contactor where ozone is applied for pre-oxidation and pre-disinfection. Ozonated water then enters the rapid mix structure where coagulants are added. The water is then fed to up-flow clarifiers, and then to a gravity filtration system. In the final stage, filtered water is disinfected with chlorine, monitored for chlorine residual, dosed with ammonia to create chloramines and released to SCVWA's transmission system for distribution. Potentially hazardous chemicals that are stored and used onsite include chlorine, aqueous ammonia (19%), hydrogen peroxide, diesel fuel, liquefied oxygen, ferric chloride and sodium hydroxide. Gaseous chlorine, used for disinfection of water, is stored in one-ton cylinders. The maximum chlorine storage capacity in the new chlorine building at the plant is currently 54 cylinders (108,000 pounds). Chlorine is no longer stored in the former chlorine building.\n\n\n\nChemicals Subject to USEPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) and Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM"

      "SummaryText": ") Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nSCVWA uses chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5) at the facility in quantities large enough to trigger the USEPA RMP and CalARP, a state mandated accidental chemical release prevention program. The USEPA RMP threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 pounds. The CalARP threshold quantity for chlorine is 100 pounds. The current maximum storage capacity is 54 one-ton cylinders (108,000 pounds). The SCVWA facility is also subject to OSHA PSM regulations for all equipment and operations associated with chlorine storage and disinfection systems. The threshold quantity under PSM for chlorine is 1,500 pounds. The Federal RMP and CalARP rule define three program levels based on the processes' relative potential for public impacts, the level of effort needed to prevent accidents and coverage by other regulations. At the SCVWA facility, public receptors are located within the distance to an endpoint concentration and the facility is subject to the PSM standard; therefore, the facility is subject to Program 3 requirements. The remaining chemicals stored at the facility are either addressed in a separate RMP (i.e., aqueous ammonia), or not covered under the RMP, CalARP or PSM programs.\n\n\n\nAccidental Releases during Past Five Years\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: \n\n\n\n- On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n- Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis study on December 15, 2021, there have been no significant releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10"

SCVWA's PSM programs include the following activities to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n\n\n\n* Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to establish they are properly designed and installed.\n\n\n\n* Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures. All procedures must be reviewed and are certified annually.\n\n\n\n* Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n\n\n\n* Procedures to provide all contractors with information on chemical safety training.\n\n\n\n* Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, with documentation of all inspections.\n\n\n\n* Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n\n\n\n* Rigorous safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n\n\n\n* Investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine releases.\n\n\n\n* Periodic evaluation of the safety records of all outside contractors who work on the RMP-regulated systems.\n\n\n\n* Development of an effective emergency response program.\n\n\n\n* Implementation of an employee participation program to maintain that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM program, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\n\n\n\n* Independent audits of the entire PSM program and RMP program every three years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Procedures\n\n\n\nSanta Clarita Valley Water Agency has developed a California Consolidated Contingency Plan (CCCP) to provide step-by-step procedures for emergency"

The key elements of SCVWA's emergency preparedness program are as follows:\n\n- The plant uses a combination of audible alarms and a plant loudspeaker system to alert the staff of a potential accident and to conduct in-plant communications.\n\n- In the unlikely event of an uncontrollable accidental release, the facility would immediately contact the Los Angeles County Fire Department and evacuate to designated staging areas.\n\n \n\nSCVWA's Recent Steps to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBased on SCVWA's dedication to process safety and the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) review that was conducted in December 2021, SCVWA has integrated the following components and procedures into the chlorine disinfection system to reduce the likelihood or severity of potential chlorine releases:\n\n- A chlorine gas detection system.\n\n- An emergency chlorine shutoff system that will automatically activate if a chlorine gas leak is detected. \n\n- A chlorine gas scrubber that will start and operate to remove and neutralize chlorine gas that is in the Chlorine Building. \n\n- Extensive operator training.\n\n- Periodic process hazard review updates for the chlorination system.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
