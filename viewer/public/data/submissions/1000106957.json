PP, Plymouth, WI, is a cheese production facility\nsupplying package cheese products to private label, retail and foodservice customers around the country.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (cas #7664-41-7) is used as a refrigerant to cool facility production floors, receiving dock\nand warehouse and finished dock and product warehouse. Designed as a single stage, closed loop system,\nliquid ammonia, either pumped or high pressure, is circulated to air-cooling units. Ammonia vapor, or a\ncombination of vapor and liquid, returns to the recirculator vessel through common suction headers. Heat\nladen ammonia vapor is pulled from the recirculators, compressed, and sent to rooftop condensers where\nheat is removed and the ammonia gas is condensed back to liquid. Liquid from the condensers gravity drains\nto the High Pressure/Thermosyphon Receiver. The high side operating pressure is 125 to 180 psig; low side\noperating pressure is 30 to 40 psig. Maximum quantity of ammonia on-site is 13,700 lbs. Since the\nrefrigeration system contains more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Masters Galley Foods, Inc.\nhas developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the refrigeration system.\n\nAs part of the PSM program, Masters Gallery Foods, Inc. has completed a process hazard analysis, developed\nwritten operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established\nprocedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a\nmechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the\nrefrigeration process, Masters Gallery Foods, Inc. implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program\nto ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specif"
