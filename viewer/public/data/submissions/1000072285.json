In this effort, Quincy Foods has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated. Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response. It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement.\r\n\r\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance \r\nQuincy Foods facility located in Grant County. This facility has one refrigeration system using Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) as the refrigerant. The total ammonia inventory exceeds the threshold quantity for accidental release prevention. \r\n\r\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nEPA's Risk Management Prevention Program 3, 40 CFR Part 68(D) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 outline the facilities accidental release prevention program below. The facility has committed to completing audits and inspections as well as holding employee meetings to establish current procedures, ensure there is employee buy in for procedures and seek new opportunities for improvement to health and safety policies.\r\n\r\n\u00bf Employee Participation Program\r\n\u00bf Process Safety Information\r\n\u00bf Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\u00bf Operating Procedures\r\n\u00bf Training Program\r\n\u00bf Contractor Safety Program\r\n\u00bf Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\r\n\u00bf"
