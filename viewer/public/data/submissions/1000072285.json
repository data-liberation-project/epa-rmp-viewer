Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action Policies\n\nThe top priority of Quincy Foods is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community. In this effort, Quincy Foods has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\n\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated. Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response. It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nQuincy Foods facility located in Grant County. This facility has one refrigeration system using Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) as the refrigerant. The total ammonia inventory exceeds the threshold quantity for accidental release prevention. \n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEPA's Risk Management Prevention Program 3, 40 CFR Part 68(D) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 outline the facilities accidental release prevention program below. The facility has committed to completing audits and inspections as well as holding employee meetings to establish current procedures, ensure there is employee buy in for procedures and seek new opportunities for improvement to health and safety policies.\n\n\n\n? Employee Participation Program\n\n? Process Safety Information\n\n? Process Hazard Analysis\n\n? Operating Procedures\n\n? Training Program\n\n? Contractor Safety Program\n\n? Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\n? "

Five-Year Accident History\n\nA review into the accident history of the facility revealed that there have been no reportable releases of ammonia over the past five years.\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nQuincy Foods is using Grant County Fire and Rescue Fire Department as the first responder to an incident in the event of an uncontrolled release. Quincy Foods has developed an Emergency Action plan to ensure an efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous substance release, fire, explosion or any other emergency. The plan includes First Aid procedures and Emergency Medical Treatment procedures, Evacuation plans, Notification/Communication.\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nQuincy Foods is proactive in their approach to health and safety of its employees and surrounding community. Any areas of improvement that can be identified in audits, hazard analyses and inspections are identified, and corrective actions are taken in the event a recommendation is made promptly.  \n\n"
