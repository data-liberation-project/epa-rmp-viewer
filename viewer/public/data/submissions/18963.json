We are committed to the prevention of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Laurel Fire Department, and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous amonnia is recieved,  stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum inventory of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks is 92,700 pounds.\n\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of my largest tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on the most likely indident to occur which is a break in a transfer hose. \n\nThe facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death,  injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Laurel Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department : members of the fire"
