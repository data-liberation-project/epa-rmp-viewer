Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest\nrequirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n            \nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n         \n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n       Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code\n       Five-year accident history\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \n          \nThis facility is regulated under Program 2 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n          \n       It stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of the threshold quantity\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public receptor (residence)\n       It does not operate under a SIC code specified in the rule\n       It has not had a reportable accident in the past five years\n       It is not subject to OSHA PSM (this is a retail facility).\n\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary\nsource that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process,\nas determined under 40 CFR 68.115.

This scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor line to the tank\ntruck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture area is assumed at 0.5 square\ninches.  Because personnel are always present at the facility during transfer, S & M Fertilizer\npersonnel will respond within 10 minutes.
