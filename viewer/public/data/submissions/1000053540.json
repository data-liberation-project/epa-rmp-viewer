      "SummaryText": " geothermal fluid is injected back into the subsurface reservoir via two injection wells.\n\n\n\nJersey Valley is operated by Ormat's Nevada Eastern Operations Group. The NV-East Operations Group (NVE-Ops) is comprised of management, administration, maintenance, engineering and operations personnel. NV-Ops operate all of the Nevada power generation facilities owned or operated by Ormat.\n\n\n\nStaff typically consists of one on site plant operator. Remote monitoring and maintenance and administrative support is provided to the Jersey Valley facility from the Galena 3 control room at the Steamboat Geothermal Facilities near Reno, Nevada. The Jersey Valley facility operates continuously 24 hours a day and 365 days of the year (excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or plant upsets).\n\n \n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nJersey Valley stores n-pentane (CAS # 109-66-0) as the motive fluid used in the Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) units. In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119 the use of n-pentane as a process or motive fluid in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires the establishment of a PSMP, CAPP and RMP. The plant has two n-Pentane storage tanks that have the capacity to hold 42,000 gallons of n-Pentane. The total amount of n-pentane stored on site is 330,478 pounds. \n\n \n\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to both "

The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC system at Jersey Valley. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals.\n\n\n\nAlarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufactures recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices. Standard Operating Procedure #9, Maintenance Instructions (SOP-9) will identify system maintenance procedures, frequencies and recommended spare parts.\n\n\n\nTraining: Initial training for personnel is given before that employee is allowed to either handle n-pentane, operate or work on the facility's process area or on process equipment. Initial training shall be completed with Emergency Services Personnel including a tour of the site, gas and fire detection system operations, and familiarization with the motive fluid characteristics.  \n\n\n\nRefresher training is conducted on an annual basis, at a minimum, and when review of the chemicals or process(es) reveals a need for additional training. Initial and refresher training, associated with the RMP program, is documented and maintained per the requirements of the Training. Additional training will also be provided as needed or requested by Emergency Services Personnel. Contracted employees, shall be trained in the requirements of the EAP procedure prior to working at the Jersey Valley site.

Refresher training for all personnel shall be conducted annually at a minimum.\n\n\n\nSafety Training: Some equipment at the Jersey Valley Geothermal Power Plant poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites.  These subjects include Emergency Action Plan (EAP), motive fluid hazards, fire prevention and hot work, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, confined space, hearing conservation, personal protective equipment, accident, injury and incident reporting. Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Standard Safety Procedures.\n\n\n\nn-Pentane system: Deviation from the design limits of operation for the n-pentane transfer system will not normally occur since the individual components are rated beyond the highest achievable values of pressure, temperature, and flow within the system.\n\n \n\nOEC Units: The OEC units are controlled and monitored by their own dedicated HMI Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The PLC receives all discrete (logic) and analog signals from the input devices (e.g.  switches and measuring sensors), processes the signals according to pre-loaded Ormat software, and then outputs logic and analog command signals to local and field devices. All parameters needed for proper operation of the OEC units, such as pressure, temperature, voltage, current, power, speed, etc. are measured by the proper measuring instruments.  Deviation from the operating parameters will immediately be detected by the PLC and the PLC will initiate correction or automatic shutdown of the related OEC unit.
