Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nSouthern Gardens Citrus Processing Corporation (the Company) recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility. \n\n\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has developed a Plant Safety Program based on the Voluntary Protection Program guidelines. The mission of the plant Safety Program is to provide a safe work environment through involvement, commitment, and genuine caring by all employees. Efficiency and safety performance is measured by closely tracking Lost Work Day Index and Injury Illness Rates.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs, which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation. The Utilities Team Leader is responsible for the management of accidental release prevention and the Safety Resource is responsible for management of the Emergency Response Programs.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic events. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Company operates a fruit juice processing facility at this location. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the syste"

Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and since the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard, this facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nIn the ammonia refrigeration system, ammonia is transformed from vapor to liquid then back to vapor by mechanical compression, expansion, and evaporation in order to exchange heat to achieve a desired temperature in the storage and processing areas. The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the compressors to the condensers where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a liquid. The liquid from the condensers is collected in a high-pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe liquid ammonia is then circulated to the units (freezers, air units, storage tanks, and chillers) located in the production and storage areas. The ammonia liquid flows across heat exchanger surfaces (coils, tubes, or freezer barrels) where it picks up heat, changing from a liquid to a vapor. The ammonia vapor is then sent back to the compressor to start the cycle over.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility's process exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA PSM Standard 1910.119, and the facility is therefore subject to the PSM requirements. For RMP compliance purposes, this places the refrigeration process at the facility in the Program 3 level. Therefore, the facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis (PHA) is conducted. The program also ensures that all employees have access to the program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the e"

The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure safe work practices are followed. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been conducted, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration system is built and maintained using preventative maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit: Procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change: The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: The procedures ensure that any accidents and near misses are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the program to ensure that the PSM program i"
