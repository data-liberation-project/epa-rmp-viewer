It is the policy of the Cameron Water Treatment Plant to provide its employees with a safe and healthful work environment and to conduct its operations in such a manner as to have minimal impact on the environment and the surrounding community. Every effort has been made to provide the greatest degree of safety possible for city employees and the citizens of Cameron. This Risk Management Plan includes all elements of the EPA regulations, including developing a process hazard analysis, standard operating procedures for the water treatment process, employee training programs, and preventive maintenance schedules. Water Department employees will be provided full access to this document, including the process hazard analysis and all other information contained in the risk management program.\nThe primary activity of the Cameron Water Treatment Plant is to provide the City of Cameron with a safe reliable source of drinking water. This is accomplished through the use of chlorine gas as a disinfecting agent of the water supply. Chlorine gas is stored in one ton containers and is fed to various stages of the treatment process through a chlorination system. The maximum amount of chlorine in storage at the water treatment plant is three ton containers. Two containers are connected to the chlorination system at any one time, one container is in use while the other is on stand-by.\nThe Cameron Water Treatment Plant has in place a preventive maintenance program covering all components of the chlorination system The preventive maintenance program is intended to insure the continued integrity of process equipment and to minimize the risk of a catastrophic chlorine release. This preventive maintenance program requires regular inspection and testing of chlorination equipment by Water Treatment Plant "

All water treatment plant personnel will receive initial training in emergency response and evacuation procedures. This training includes emplyee duties and responsibilities in the event of a toxic chemical release, procedures for the proper use and maintenance of emergency response and protective equipment, proper use of communications equipment,pertinent telephone numbers and point of contact for emergency responders, andevacuation routes and locations of safe zones.\nEmergency response has been coordinated with the Cameron Fire Department, the Cameron Police Department, Dekalb and Clinton County Sheriffs Departments and the Clinton and Dekalb County LEPCs.In the advent of a major chlorine release, water plant personnel will only offer technical assistance to emergency responders.\nThe Water Treatment Plant is committed to improving the quality of employee training and education programs, including training in the safe use of chlorine and in appropriate emergency response.
