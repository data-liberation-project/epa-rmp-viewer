The Nitro plant is ISO-9002 registered and is ranked Class 'A' for MRPII (Planning and Control) by Oliver Wight.\n\nPlant Products\nThe chemicals produced are phosphorus chlorides and phosphate esters.  The phosphorus chlorides are intermediates, which are used to manufacture, among many others, products in the fields of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, agricultural products and water treatment.

      "SummaryText": "ness, phosphate esters are used extensively in areas of fire risk due to their outstanding flame retardant capabilities.  They are incorporated into a variety of polymers which are used to make construction components, TV casings, flooring, computer housing and the like.  Phosphate esters are also to be found in fluid and hydraulic systems where their flame retardant properties provide safe systems in high temperature and high-risk applications such as steel mills, ships and aircraft. \n\nRegulated Chemicals \nFive chemicals on site are regulated under RMP.  Chlorine, phosphorus trichloride and phosphorus oxychloride are classed by EPA as RMP toxic substances.  Propylene and 2-methyl propene are classed by EPA as RMP flammable substances.\n\nRegulated Processes\n* Chlorine and phosphorus are reacted to form phosphorus trichloride, which is purified by distillation.  This is Process ID 1, Phosphorus Trichloride, and is Program Level 3.\n* Phosphorus trichloride is oxidized to form phosphorus oxychloride.  This is Process ID 2, Phosphorus Oxychloride, and is Program Level 3.\n* Propylene and 2-methyl propene are reacted with phenol to make an alkylated phenol (which is then used as a raw material in the manufacture of phosphate esters).  This is Process ID 3, Alkylate, and is Program Level 3.\n\n\n>>Release Scenarios\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n* The worst case scenario for an RMP toxic chemical involves a full tank car of phosphorus trichloride and assumes that the entire contents of the car, 170,000 pounds, is released within 10 minutes.  This worst case scenario also assumes that none of the available mitigation measures are used.  Modeling was done using EPA's RMP*Comp software, which estimated the endpoint of the plume to be 15 miles.\n* The worst case scenario for an RMP flammable chemical involves a full tank car of propylene and assumes that the entire contents of the car, 120,000 pounds, is released within 10 minutes.

Modeling was done using EPA's RMP*Comp software, which estimated the endpoint distance for the vapor cloud explosion to be 0.4 miles.  \n\nAlternative Case Scenarios\n* Note that for the two flammable RMP chemicals, propylene and 2-methylpropene, there were no credible alternative case scenarios that extended offsite.  However, since the RMP*Submit software's completeness check routine requires that there must be an entry in Section 5. Flammables: Alternative Release, this scenario is included, even though it does not have an offsite impact.  A piping leak from a flange gasket releases 90 pounds of propylene during the five-minute release period.  Modeling using EPA's RMP*Comp software estimated the endpoint distance for the vapor cloud explosion to be 0.02 miles.\n* For phosphorus trichloride, the alternative release scenario assumes that a piping leak occurs during loading when a flange gasket fails.  Although a person continually monitors the loading, a period of five minutes is allowed to identify the problem and to operate the switches that remotely shut off the pump and close the block valves, thereby stopping the release at 750 pounds.  This scenario assumes that the leak occurs at a point where there is no dike or other containment and that that none of the other available mitigation measures are used to stop or suppress the release or to clean up the spill.  Modeling was done using EPA's RMP*Comp software, which estimated the endpoint of the plume to be 0.2 miles.  \n* The alternative release scenario for phosphorus oxychloride is essentially the same as for phosphorus trichloride, and also assumes that the leak occurs where there is no dike or other containment and that none of the other available mitigation measures are used to stop or suppress the release or to clean up the spill.

In this scenario, the leak can't be stopped quickly by remotely operated valves and the assumed leak rate is too low to activate the car's excess flow valve (internal shutoff).  A period of twenty minutes is allowed for plant personnel to don the appropriate personal protective equipment and to set up the proper incident command, communication and other activities required to safely go on top of the car and stop the leak.  A total of 3020 pounds of chlorine would be released during the twenty-minute period.

These policies, programs and procedures are in place for all affected processes in the plant including the specific chemicals regulated under RMP. \n\nSafety, prevention and emergency response steps are also in place to further reduce the likelihood of any effect on the community in the event of a release.  These prevention systems for the specific processes are described more fully in Section 7 of this document.\n\n\n>>Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the last five years, there was one accidental release reportable under the RMP guidelines.

However, intermittent rain, which was occurring at the time, reacted with the liquid phosphorus trichloride and generated hydrogen chloride, some of which then vaporized and left the site.  The maximum quantity of hydrogen chloride that theoretically could have been generated from the phosphorus trichloride would have been 8000 pounds but the actual release from the site was much smaller because the majority of the phosphorus trichloride and hydrogen chloride were retained and/or neutralized onsite.  The actual amount of hydrogen chloride released from the site was calculated to be 1470 pounds.\n\nA precautionary shelter-in-place was called but was lifted when air monitoring tests surrounding the plant were completed.  FMC does not know the exact number of persons who sheltered-in-place.  No injuries or damage either on or off site were reported to FMC at the time.  Later, litigation was brought regarding the incident and is still in progress.\n\n\n>>The Emergency Response Program\n\nNitro plant management, through the Responsible Care Steering Committee, recognize that preparedness and planning for emergencies are essential parts of our operation and are equally important as meeting our production schedules and other responsibilities.  In dealing with incidents and accidents the following principles will apply:\n* Minor incidents will be dealt with by the on-site emergency response team.\n* Significant incidents will be contained by the on-site team until local area emergency service arrive at the scene.\n \nThe objectives of this program are:\n* Prevention of injury and loss of life of our employees and people in neighboring plants and the surrounding community.\n* Prevention and minimization of environmental impact of releases.\n* Minimization of property damage.\n* Release of accurate information to the"
