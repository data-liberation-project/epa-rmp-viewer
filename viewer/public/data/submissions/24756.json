THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n      THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF (CARGILL INC.) ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.   FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n      THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n      ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n      THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 1,240,000 POUNDS IN OUR TWO 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS, OUR NURSE TANKS, AND UP TO FOUR RAILCARS ON OUR TRACK.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A RAIL CAR HOLDING 160,000 POUNDS.\n\n3.   THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n      A.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A RAIL TANK CAR RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 160,000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF A RAIL TANK CAR AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.22 MILES.\n\n      B.   THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW, IS A TWO MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A THREE INCH PIPE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES\n\n4.   THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n      THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, IN"

ON FEBRUARY 26, 1999, AND EMPLOYEE WAS BLEEDING ANHYDROUS AMMONIA TANKS INTO A WATER TANK AND HAD THE GAS DISCHARGE ON HIS ARM.\n\n6.   THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n      THE FACILITY HAS:\n\nA.   A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nB.   PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n\nC.

PERIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS.  THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME."
