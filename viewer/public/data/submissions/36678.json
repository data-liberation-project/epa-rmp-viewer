      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.155 states that the owner or operator of a regulated source shall provide an executive summary in their Risk Management Plan (RMP) that includes a brief description of the Risk Management Program elements established under the rule.  This executive summary is intended to satisfy those requirements.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nSimplot Phosphates LLC Rock Springs Fertilizer manufacturing complex is located approximately 4.5 miles southeast of Rock Springs, WY on Highway 430 in Sweetwater, County.  This facility was formerly SF Phosphates Limited Company, a partnership between the JR Simplot Company and Farmland Industries.  The sale and resulting name change became official in November of 2003.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a small residential subdivision to the southwest of the facility, the area is undeveloped and rural.  This facility manufactures phosphate fertilizer used primarily for agricultural food crops.  The facility employs 210 full time staff and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Simplot is a solid and responsible member of the Rock Springs community.  The company and its employees strive to contribute and improve the community they work and live in through their involvement, volunteerism and support of local programs.  \r\n\r\nSimplot is committed to protecting the environment and preserving natural resources through the responsible use of toxic substances, pollution prevention at the source and responsible recycling, treatment and disposal of waste materials.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nSimplot Phosphates LLC, Rock Springs Fertilizer Complex, Rock Springs, Wyoming, is committed to being a responsible community partner. Emergency response planning and training of all employees is current and on going.  The company fully supports an emergency rescue team (ERT), whose members receive more advanced training.  Every reasonable effort is made to prevent a ?significant accidental release? to t"

Local fire departments and local emergency management agencies receive annual Sara Title III reports that provide information about materials that are manufactured, stored, and used at the facility.  It is Simplot?s policy to fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from regulatory agencies.\r\n\t\r\n\tRegulated Substances Processed, Stored or Used:\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThis facility manufactures phosphate fertilizer products and industrial chemicals. These processes require the use of two substances listed in the RMP rule.  These substances are anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.  The facility stores and uses these substances in quantities exceeding the applicability threshold limits, therefore requiring the facility to develop a Risk Management Program and submit an RMP.  The initial RMP was submitted on June 16, 1999.  The facility?s plan information was presented at an advertised public meeting on May 18, 1999.  \r\n\r\nBecause these processes and substances are also subject to the OSHA-PSM standard and are not eligible for Program 1, the processes that contain these substances will be regulated as Program 3 processes under the RMP rule.  Both of these substances are regulated as toxic substances.  There are no regulated flammable substances above their respective threshold quantity at this facility. \r\n\t\t\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\r\n\t\r\n\tThe RMP rule requires facilities containing Program 3 processes to provide a hazard assessment and off site consequence analysis (OCA) of the potential worst-case and alternative release scenarios involving regulated substances.  The rule requires that a worst-case scenario representative of all toxic substances and an alternative release scenario for each toxic substance be evaluated and reported in the RMP.  For the initial RMP submittal, worst-case scenarios were evaluated.  This evaluation determined that the worst-case scenario is dictated by the catastrophic failure of a pressurize"

This release is assumed to occur during worst-case release conditions of low wind speed, stable atmospheric conditions and maximum ambient temperature.  Assuming these conditions, the release was evaluated with the publicly available model DEGADIS, which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with this type of release.   \r\n\r\n\tThis submittal contains the same worst-case scenario that was included in the original submittal.  In addition to the extremely unlikely probability of such a hypothetical scenario occurring, Simplot has numerous prevention and safety features including elevation of storage vessels, concrete barriers around storage vessels, a comprehensive inspection program, pressure relief and emergency shutoff valves and water fog nozzles in place in order to reduce the potential for this scenario.   No releases involving these vessels have occurred since the original RMP submittal.  In fact, none have occurred during the entire operational history of the facility.\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios should be modeled and be representative of scenarios that may have occurred or are more likely to occur.  The Rock Springs processes regulated under this rule have not had any previous accidental releases since the original submittal or during the entire operational history of the facility, therefore the alternative release scenarios are also based on a hypothetical, although more likely potential release scenarios.  Alternate scenarios are modeled using DEGADIS assuming typical meteorological conditions.  The same two alternate scenarios that were included in the original submittal are duplicated in this submittal.  \r\n\r\nAlthough these release scenarios are hypothetical and unlikely to occur, we are prepared to respond to any release at the facili"

Under the OSHA Program, the facility is required to develop a prevention program, which is equivalent to that required by the Risk Management Program rule. Simplot Rock Springs developed and implemented the prevention program in accordance with the OSHA-PSM requirements well before the RMP required them to do so.  The prevention programs for the covered processes establish a multi-element program and management policies and procedures which when implemented will facilitate the prevention of accidental releases and will minimize any potential release.  Simplot Rock Springs staff assigned to work on these processes are highly trained \r\nin the safe handling of all hazardous materials present at the facility, especially those in the covered processes. Each employee receives initial training and annual refreshers appropriate to the job when hired or when re-assigned. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tIn addition to training, the following prevention program elements inherent in the Process Safety Management (PSM) program have been implemented in all areas where anhydrous ammonia and chlorine are present. The following elements of PSM decrease the likelihood of a release:\r\n\r\n(1) Mechanical Integrity is a preventative maintenance program that assures the structural integrity of process vessels and piping.\r\n(2) Hot Work Permits are required to prevent fires in areas where ammonia would be effected.\r\n(3) Process Hazard Analyses are performed on all new processes and periodically on existing process that contain ammonia or chlorine.\r\n(4) Management of Change procedures"
