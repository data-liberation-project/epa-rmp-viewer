During cooling, the refrigerant (ammonia) is pumped through the cooler units for cooling and returns to the Recirculation System in both liquid and vapor form.  The vapor is drawn into the screw compressors through the suction line where they are compressed and discharged through piping to the ammonia condenser located outside.  Forced air and recirculated water cool and condense the vapors.  From the condensers, the ammonia drain by gravity back to the High Pressure Receiver, thus completing the loop.  Ammonia is a non-corrosive chemical; therefore, does not deteriorate the inside of vessels, line or valves provided they are carbon steel (not copper).  It also carries a small amount of oil from the compressors that would tend to further protect the inside surfaces.  All vessels containing ammonia will be ASME pressure rated at 250 psi or higher which is higher than the maximum operating pressure.  All pressure vessels will be Permitted by the State of Utah and inspected according to the State requirements.\r\n\r\n(c)Each worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario, including without limitation, administrative controls and mitigation measure taken to limit the distances to the endpoint for each scenario;\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case release scenario involves the release of 8,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period which would result due to a failure of the high pressure receiver.  This quantity is considered in the event that (for some reason) the entire system charge would be A\u00bfpumped downA\u00bf into the High Pressure Receiver and the HP Receiver should rupture.  Pressure vessels are never to be filled to more than 80% or 85% or their capacity and the 8,000 pounds is based on 100% of the vessel.  Under this Worst-Case scenario and the prescribed A\u00bfstaleA\u00bf air and wind conditions, ammonia could travel 1.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case rlease scenario is highl"
