This site is located in Tom Green County in the city of San Angelo, TX. The facility has 26 full time employees.\n\nWest Texas Utilities (WTU) is an investor-owned utility. The company's common stock is held by Central and South West Corporation, a registered public holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe facility is a two-unit electric power station with a total generation of approximately 124 mw.  It burns natural gas as the primary fuel. Unit 1 is a combustion  turbine generator installed in 1965. Unit 2 is a Westinghouse steam turbine generator with a Riley boiler installed in 1966.\n\nThe following information is part of a complete Risk Management Plan (RMP) that was prepared for the WTU San Angelo Power Station.  The information includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical description, five year accidental release history, alternative release scenario and the worst case scenario.  The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community safety, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely scenario would ever occur.  These scenarios are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency and are used to illustrate the importance for risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe San Angelo Power Station has been producing electricity for over 30 years. During this time, there has not been any chlorine release that adversely impacted the plant or the surrounding community.\n\nThe release scenarios, a worst case scenario and an alternative release scenario, are designed to be exercises which calculate the potential impact "

      "SummaryText": "on the community based upon extreme conditions defined by the governing agency, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  A worst case scenario is defined as the complete release of the largest inventory of the chemical over 10 minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The distance(s) used in this plan are from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide (May 1996). It also assumes that none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems is operational for this theoretical exercise. However, the laws of physical science do not allow a complete release of the chemical as described in the worst case scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario for the San Angelo Power Station involves a cylinder containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The entire quantity is released and vaporizes over a 10 minute period and the resulting vapor cloud travels down wind.  A level of concern to the community extends 5.4 miles down wind. \n\nGiven these unrealistic guidelines of a worst case scenario, more realistic scenarios or alternative release scenarios were also developed. These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow a site's safety systems to work.  The alternative release scenario may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the San Angelo Power Station involves 33 pounds of chlorine released in 60 minutes from a <-inch pigtail or similar connection. The resulting cloud extends 0.58 miles down wind.\n\nWTU chlorinating systems are built and installed with safety controls designed to prevent accidental releases. Some of the typical safety equipment and systems used at the plant include:\n7 Storage cylinders meeting American Society of Mechanical Engineering requirements\n7 Shut-off devices\n7 Interlocks and relief valves\n7 Specifically designed pressure gauges, fittings, connections, tubing and piping.\n \n Plant employees, including plant operators, electricians, mec"

This procedure requires:\n7 Periodic inspection and testing of all mechanical systems \n7 Detailed documentation of all inspection and maintenance activity\n7 Documentation of equipment deficiencies\n7 Timely and appropriate repair of all deficiencies.\n \n A Process Safety Management System has been specifically developed for the chlorination system at this plant in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act Process Safety Management rule.
