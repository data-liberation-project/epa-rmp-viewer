Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy\n\nKinetic is committed to protecting the health and safety of all individuals affected by our activities.  We are committed to safeguarding the environment and contributing to the well-being of the communities in which we operate.\n\nKinetic works to continually improve our EHS performance by:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tIntegrating EHS best practices into all parts of our business.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEnsuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tIdentifying, assessing and managing EHS risk throughout our business.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEnsuring that each employee, contractor and third party service provider understands their EHS responsibilities, is trained to meet them and is monitored for compliance.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEstablishing EHS objectives and regularly measuring our progress.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tMaintaining Kinetic\u00c2\u00bfs commitment to open and honest dialog with stakeholders\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe function of the Lynchburg Terminal is the wholesale distribution of propane.  The propane is normally delivered by rail tank car, stored in nine 30,000 gallon capacity vessels and is distributed by customers trucks.  The one substance regulated under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) is propane.  The quantities of propane stored in each 30,000 gallon vessel are controlled to 90% of their capacity to prevent overpressuring.  This procedure is backed up by a system to prevent pressure exceeding 250 psi, preventing structural damage to the vessels and also preventing an uncontrolled release.  Based on the aforesaid, the maximum inventory in storage at the site is 9 times 27,000 gallons or 241,000 gallons equivalent to 1,027,112 pounds of propane.\n\n\n3.  Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequences analyses for the terminal are based on the requirements set forth in RMP rules (40 CFR 68).

The following describes the details:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tWorse case scenario for Program 3 involves a catastrophic release from one of the 9-30,000 gallon tanks in the propane storage and involves the release of the entire content of the tank (27,000 gallons or 114,124 lbs).  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, with 10% of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Off-site receptors would not be affected.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAlternate release scenario for Program 3 involves a release from one of the propane storage tanks when a truck loading pipe/hose is ruptured releasing 49,000 lbs of propane.  It assumes that the entire quantity is released as a vapor with 10% of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Off-site receptors would not be affected.\n\n\n4.  General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention \n     Steps\n\nKinetic Resources has taken steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.

New employees receive basic training in facility operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n(e)  Mechanical Integrity\nThe integrity of mechanical operations is ensured through documented maintenance checks on major equipment.  Process equipment examined includes, among others:  pressure vessels, piping systems, relief valves, emergency shut down systems, controls, meters and pumps.  Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel at all times.  Any equipment deficiencies are carried out in a safe and timely manner.\n(f)  Compliance Audits\nKinetic Resources will conduct periodic audits at the terminal to ensure the provisions of the RMP rules are implemented at least every three years as required under 40 CFR 68.58.  Any shortcoming will be corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n(g)  Incident Investigation\nKinetic Resources investigates any occurrence that could have or has resulted in a major release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to an incident or potential incident as well as corrective action required to prevent a reoccurrence.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.  \n(h)  Employee Participation\nA successful RMP is a team effort and the terminal staff is an integral part of the team and is encouraged to express their views. In addition, each terminal employee shall have access to all information created as part of the implementation of the RMP, in particular, information relating to and resulting from process hazard analysis.\n(i)  Contractors\nPeriodically Kinetic Resources hires contractors to do specialized maintenance.

Emergency Action Plan\n\nA written action plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances and other incidents is maintained at the terminal.  The plan includes mitigating actions, medical treatment, evacuation, notification of responders, affected parties and public.  To ensure proper response an emergency response team is always in place and equipment regularly inspected/serviced.
