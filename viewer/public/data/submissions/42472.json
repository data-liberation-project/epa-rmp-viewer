      "SummaryText": "The City of Moore Haven is a small, rural community in Glades County. The City of Moore Haven provides water service to approximately 2,000 people in and around the City of Moore Haven. The City of Moore Haven owns and operates a water treatment plant (WTP) located at 4725 U.S. 27, Moore Haven. The WTP site is approximately 26.46 acres and is located approximately 9.3 miles from the center of the City.   The WTP uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant and to remove organics.\nThe WTP has a dedicated Chlorine Building located on-site. Chlorine gas is stored on the site in four two-ton containers. The maximum chlorine inventory at the site is 8,000 Ibs. \n\nProcess Equipment and Technology\n\nChlorine gas is used at the site for two purposes: water disinfection and color control. The water system is disinfected with chlorine solution, using chlorine gas from 2-two ton containers operating on a vacuum system.   The system has two operational ton containers and typically has a total of four containers at any one time.\n\nChlorination System Layout\nThe Chlorine Building (CB) is a concrete block building positioned on the south-central section of the water treatment plant site, between the Operations Building and the Softener (solids contact unit). The CB measures approximately 16 feet by 16 feet (equating to 256 square feet). All the chlorination equipment and chlorine storage containers are contained in the CB. The CB has one double door on the east side of the building. The room is naturally ventilated through the louvers installed on east and west walls. The Chlorine Building houses one Chlor-Scale model 21L trunnion set and two container scales. The facility is also equipped with an electric container hoist system comprised of an electric motor, lifting bar, and cable, remote control, and longitudinal beam (monorail). The monorail spans the entire length of the Chlorine Building and out from the CB approximately 4 feet.\nTypically, there are four ton containers stored in the CB;"

Two of the ton containers are operational; these containers rest on scales at the west side of the building.   The scales have a capacity of 4,000 Ibs with a digital readout. The scale readout is mounted on the north wall of the room, adjacent to the chlorinators.\nThe CB is equipped with a C-262 Chlorine Specialties, Inc., ton container lifting bar. The lifting bar has hooks, which grab the ton containers on their ends. A steel monorail and an electric motorized hoist provide the mechanism by which ton containers are positioned in the CB. The monorail extends the complete distance of the concrete pad. The electric hoist has a capacity of 4,000 Ibs. The estimated tare weight of an empty ton container is 1,346 Ibs. Therefore, the maximum load exhibited by a full container is approximately 3,346 Ibs, providing a safety factor for the trunnions and scales of 654 Ibs, or 16.3 % of its capacity. Containers can vary in size and weight and may weigh slightly more or less than 1346 Ibs. Horizontal movement along the monorail is accomplished manually. Ton containers are removed by lifting them with the electric hoist and moving them to the east end of the CB. The containers are choked until being lifted onto the delivery vehicle. Full containers are lifted from the delivery vehicle by the electric hoist and moved westward to the scales or trunnion set. When containers are delivered or withdrawn, they must be assisted onto the truck by operational and/or delivery staff.\nEach of the unused or depleted containers is equipped with a valve cover, which provides protection. The operational and non-operational containers are positioned with the standard container valves facing northward. There is approximately 2.5 feet between the containers and the western wall.\n\nVacuum Regulators\nThe operational containers are each mounted with a vacuum regulator.

The regulator has an indicator, which provides information regarding the status of the container, whether it is operational, off, or empty. The vacuum regulator is equipped with a diaphragm valve, which closes when the vacuum is lost.\nThe vacuum regulators are remote from the chlorinators. The regulators are attached to operational containers and control the release of chlorine gas from the containers. The regulator is comprised of a pin valve and diaphragm and spring. The diaphragm is spring-loaded; under atmospheric conditions the spring forces the diaphragm to close the pin valve. The diaphragm's position is controlled by the pressures exerted on it by the chlorine gas and the spring. On the gas supply side (e.g. ton container) of the regulator, the pressure is atmospheric, while on the chlorinator side of the regulator, the pressure is atmospheric when the injector is not operational and a vacuum when the injector is operational. The water supply to the injector creates a vacuum on the gas line and pulls the diaphragm and pin valve to an open position. As the injector opens further, a higher vacuum is induced and the diaphragm opens further. If vacuum is broken, the diaphragm returns the pin valve to the closed position because the pressure on the chlorinator side of the gas line returns to atmospheric pressure, which cannot overcome the tensile pressure of the spring.\nThe vacuum regulators employed at the City of Moore Haven WTP allow automatic switchover. One of the regulating valves is in standby mode when the other is in operating mode. The valve in standby is held closed by a detent. When the on-line supply is exhausted, system vacuum increases, overcoming the latching force of the detent. The standby supply comes on line - along with the original supply.

This allows for a very short run between the operational ton containers and the controller. There are three Wallace & Tiernan V-500, A-l Chlorinators mounted on the northern wall. One installed in 1998, the others installed in 1992. Each chlorinator has a pressure relief valve which has 3/8 \" polyethylene vent line tubing which run north through ports in the northern wall. The pressure relief valve senses when there is a slight buildup in pressure in the gas supply line, approximately 10 to 20\" of water pressure (0.36 to 0.32 psi). When the valve senses a pressure buildup, it will vent to the atmosphere through the 3/8 \" vent line. The vent lines from each chlorinator unit manifold together before exiting the building through the north wall.\nThe Chlorinator units have rotometers with a capacity of 100 Ibs/day; the rotometers require manual setting. The chlorination system also includes high and low vacuum sensors on the vacuum piping between the chlorinator and injector with an audible and visible alarm. This sensor/gauge measures vacuum and senses when there is a high or low vacuum in the supply line. A high vacuum in the gas supply line indicates either the chlorine in the operational container has been exhausted, or the gas supply line has been obstructed. This safety measure ensures that chlorination is continual. The high/low vacuum thresholds are set by control personnel. The chlorination system also includes a wall mounted chlorine gas detector. The detector is mounted directly in front of the operational containers. The actual air that is analyzed by the detector is near the building's slab. The detector's method detection limit is 0.5 ppm.\n\nChlorine Gas Transmission\nThe vacuum piping from the vacuum regulators to the chlorine gas manifold is \u00bd\u00bf polyethylene tubing.

The vacuum piping from the gas chlorinators to the injectors is \u00bd\u00bf schedule 80 PVC. The vacuum lines are maintained by City of Moore Haven operational staff. Piping is routinely inspected for cracks and the seating of the tubing at connections. If a vacuum leak is present, operational staff will be able to detect it either by the whistle of the vacuum or by using ammonia vapor. Two ammonia bottles are kept in the CB for leak detection.\nOnce the gas reaches the chlorinator unit, it flows through the rotameter where the flow rate is measured. The flow rate is conveyed to the V-notch orifice, which regulates the flow. After the V-notch, the gas continues through a differential regulating valve. This is a diaphragm valve that maintains the appropriate vacuum differential across the V-notch orifice. The gas is then introduced to the water stream at the injector. The injector has built-in double-check valves, a spring-loaded diaphragm with a spherical seat and poppet check valve. These features prevent against backflooding.\n\nWater Transmission\nThe system has three No. 140 1\" fixed throat Wallace & Tiernan injectors, which are located just below the V-500 chlorinators.

When the vacuum decreases in the gas supply line, the sensor also triggers the alarm. This is an indication that there may be a leak in the gas supply line or a problem with the water supply to the injectors.\n? A chlorine gas detector monitors ambient air for the presence and concentration of chlorine. The detector consists of two platinum electrodes, which generates an electric current when in contact with chlorine. The electric current is sent to the alarm panel that activates the chlorine leak alarm. The sensor can detect chlorine levels down to 0.5 ppm. Temperature limits for the detector are between -5 to 130 \u00b0F. The electrolyte tank provides service for up to 4 years. The chlorine detector is located in the CB area, mounted on the southern side of the west wall. The detector's sensor is suspended vertically to approximately 6\" above the concrete slab. The detector sensor is located as close"

      "SummaryText": "to the operational containers as is practical.\n? Because chlorine is approximately 2.5 times heavier than air, the vacuum generated by the water supply to pull chlorine gas to the chlorinator will be more than the vacuum generated to pull air to the chlorinator.\n? The chlorination facility is equipped with an alarm panel. The panel is mounted in a NEMA 4X stainless steel enclosure. The panel has the capability to acknowledge high vacuum (loss of chlorine gas), low vacuum (loss of injector water and chlorine solution leak), chlorine leak (triggered by chlorine detector). The panel has an alarm horn, silence button, and alarm light. The alarm is connected to the auto-dialer.\n? A Haws model 830 shower/eye-wash station is located on the exterior side of the CB. It consists of an over-head drench shower and stainless steel eye bath bowl. A universal emergency sign is included with each unit.\n\nThe following characteristics of the City of Moore Haven WTP subject the facility to Rule 40 CFR Part 68, which requires development and implementation of a Risk Management Program (RMP):\n? The facility is a stationary source; and\n? The facility handles, uses, and stores a toxic substance regulated by 40 CFR 68.130 (e.g. chlorine gas); and\n? The handling, use, and storage of chlorine meet the definition of a \"process;\" and\n? The chlorine is present in quantities above the threshold quantities established by the Rule (e.g. 2,500 Ibs for chlorine).\n\nThe City of Moore Haven WTP is considered by the regulation to be a Program Level 3. This is the highest level program and requires the most extensive risk management plan. The criteria for Program Level 3 follows:\n? Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case scenario release; and\n? The process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard since the chemical use, chlorine is included in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.119 and the quantity stored and handled exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine of 2,500 Ibs.\nThe Level"

      "SummaryText": "3 Risk Management Program is basically comprised of three sections: Hazard Assessment; Prevention Program; and Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe Hazard Assessment for a toxic gas involves modeling the consequences of at least two release scenarios, the worst-case and an alternative case. The worst case scenario involves the largest container of the regulated substance being released into the environment over the period often minutes. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) air model RMP Comp* Version 1.07 was used to simulate the worst case scenario. The model uses input data to generate the estimated distance from the point of release to the toxic endpoint. The toxic endpoint is defined for chlorine gas as the point where the concentration of chlorine gas in the air is 0.0087 mg/L. For the worst case scenario, the release rate was 110 Ibs/minute and the distance to the toxic endpoint was 2.2 miles (distance from the chemical handling facility).\nThe alternative case release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case and has off-site consequences (e.g. the distance to the toxic endpoint is further than the distance to the site boundary). In the alternative release case, the RMP Comp* model allows the user to enter more site specific data, including consideration of active mitigation devices (these were not allowed for the worst case scenario). Two alternative case release scenarios were considered for the Moore Haven WTP, both resulted in the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.3 miles (1,584 feet) or less.\n\nThe second section of the Risk Management Program is the Prevention Program. In 1999, City of Moore Haven submitted a very comprehensive Prevention Program including detailed information and discussion regarding the management system at the facility; five-year accident history; process safety information review; process hazard analysis; procedures for operation, training, maintenance, management of change, compliance audit, incident investig"

The Prevention Program provides documented guidance to facility staff regarding day to day operation regarding chlorine storage, handling, and use. The Prevention Program is intended to educate staff and thereby reduce the probability of release due to improper operations, inadequate maintenance, ignorance of the hazards, or lack of safety awareness.\nThe City of Moore Haven has employed chlorine gas as a disinfectant at the current WTP since 1992. There have been no uncontrolled releases in chlorine gas, which caused injury or death to on-site or off-site persons. The chlorination system which uses chlorine gas at the facility is vacuum operated. The system employs active mitigation devices which include vacuum induced gas withdrawal, fail-close valves (vacuum regulator), secondary check valves, isolation valves, sensors (high/low vacuum, low water pressure, chlorine gas detector) which are connected to an alarm system, pressure relief valves, ventilation systems, and automatic container switchover system (via vacuum regulator). These active mitigation devices have attributed to the successful and safe operation of the system since startup. The existing system is capable of continuing to provide safe utilization of chlorine gas as a disinfectant.   Improvements to the facility will include continued maintenance of the existing system and investigation into new technologies as they are developed.\n\nThe third component of the Risk Management Program is the Emergency Response Plan. The emergency response plan documents the activities to be performed in the event of an uncontrolled release of chlorine gas into the environment. The plan provides detailed how-to information regarding movement, notification, personnel accountability, site control, release remediation, first aid, personal protective equipment, and coordination with professional emergency responders. The facility staff is primarily respons"
