      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nHelena is submitting this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68 and the State of California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Blythe Retail Facility located at 10821 W. 15th Avenue, Blythe, California 92225.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Blythe Retail Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Blythe Retail Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena is submitting this RMP as a 5-year update.   \r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Blythe Retail Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility that stores anhydrous ammonia in one 15,000-gallon storage tank and one 12,000-gallon storage tank.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to this facility via commercial carrier and transferred to the 15,000-gallon and 12,000-gallon storage tank.  The commercial operator performs the transfer from the truck to the storage tanks.  The process operations conducted by Helena personnel consist of transferring anhydrous ammonia from the two storage tanks into the nurse tanks.  Once the anhydrous ammonia is transferred into a nurse tank, Helena Chemical Company sales the product to the farmer for direct application.\r\n\r\nAdditional operations include transfer of herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides into warehouse, warehouse"

      "SummaryText": "storage, and from warehouse to customer or Helena vehicles.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for the anhydrous ammonia storage process. The worst-case scenario release for the Blythe Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank (i.e. a 15,000-gallon storage tank) were released over a 10-minute period.  The release was modeled as if the anhydrous ammonia tank were punctured allowing for the chemical to be released to the atmosphere.  The fate and transport of the anhydrous ammonia vapor was modeled with SLAB. \r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 1-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a loading or unloading operation.  The chemical release rate and fate and transport of the evaporated ammonia was managed the same as the worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case off-site consequence analysis was also conducted for herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides as required by the RMP/CALARP regulations.  The emission rates of these chemicals were calculated using standard equations recommended by U.S. EPA for such analyses.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility and is assisted by the Warehouse Manager and other personnel as directed.  The Branch and Warehouse Managers are responsible for conducting anhydrous ammonia process operations in accordance with this RMP and are responsible for the relevant maintenance, training procedures and documentation.  Upon request, a copy of its Risk Management Plan, Contingency Plan, and Operating Procedures will be provided to its contractors and auditing agency.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nHelena Chemical Company's Blythe Retail Facility is a non-responding facility.

The RMP will be updated as the Blythe Retail Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes.
