              "Description": "The Branch Manager implements the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Risk Management Program (RMPr) for the Storage & Handling of anhydrous ammonia at this facility and is assisted by the Warehouse Manager and other Helena staff as directed.  The RMPr describes the Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, and Emergency Response.  Equipment included under this covered process includes: (1) one 15,000-gallon and one 12,000-gallon stationary storage tanks and ancillary pump, piping, and valves; and (2) three 1,100-gallon, 45 1,000-gallon, and 15 500-gallon nurse tanks.  Trained Helena Process Operators perform the transfer the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the RMPr.  The nurse tanks are used by the end user (i.e. farmer).\n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the stationary storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial tanker truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor).  Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for anhydrous ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements.  Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and RMPr for review upon request by the Vendor.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68 and the State of California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Blythe Retail Facility located at 10821 W. 15th Avenue, Blythe, California 92225.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Blythe Retail Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Blythe Retail Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this RMP as a 5-year update.   \n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Blythe Retail Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility that stores anhydrous ammonia in one 15,000-gallon storage tank and one 12,000-gallon storage tank.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to this facility via commercial carrier and transferred to the 15,000-gallon and 12,000-gallon storage tank.  The commercial operator performs the transfer from the truck to the storage tanks.  The process operations conducted by Helena personnel consist of transferring anhydrous ammonia from the two storage tanks into the nurse tanks.  Once the anhydrous ammonia is transferred into a nurse tank, Helena Chemical Company sales the product to the farmer for direct application.\n\n\n\nAdditional operations include transfer of herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides into warehouse, warehouse "

      "SummaryText": "storage, and from warehouse to customer or Helena vehicles.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for the anhydrous ammonia storage process. The worst-case scenario release for the Blythe Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank (i.e. a 15,000-gallon storage tank) were released over a 10-minute period.  The release was modeled as if the anhydrous ammonia tank were punctured allowing for the chemical to be released to the atmosphere.  The fate and transport of the anhydrous ammonia vapor was modeled with SLAB. \n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 1-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a loading or unloading operation.  The chemical release rate and fate and transport of the evaporated ammonia was managed the same as the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case off-site consequence analysis was also conducted for herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides as required by the RMP/CALARP regulations.  The emission rates of these chemicals were calculated using standard equations recommended by U.S. EPA for such analyses.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility and is assisted by the Warehouse Manager and other personnel as directed.  The Branch and Warehouse Managers are responsible for conducting anhydrous ammonia process operations in accordance with this RMP and are responsible for the relevant maintenance, training procedures and documentation.  Upon request, a copy of its Risk Management Plan, Contingency Plan, and Operating Procedures will be provided to its contractors and auditing agency.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena Chemical Company's Blythe Retail Facility is a non-responding facility.

The RMP will be updated as the Blythe Retail Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes.
