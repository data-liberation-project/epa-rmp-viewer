FACILITY\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act establishes a Risk Management Program (RMP) to address the prevention of accidental chemical releases that can affect public health and the environment.  The program covers industrial facilities having more than a threshold quantity of certain specified hazardous or flammable chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe program focuses on chemical release prevention, detection, and accident response, and requires each facility to develop and implement a site-specific risk management plan including a hazards assessment, an accident prevention program and an emergency response plan.  The program requires facilities to review worst case release scenarios no matter how unlikely those scenarios may be, and identify ways to minimize impacts from such releases.\r\n\r\nThe Vertellus Zeeland Facility facility currently has one process covered under this program.  The covered process is as follows:\r\n-On-site storage and usage of ethylene, a primary raw material in the manufacture of a co-polymer product which has final application in photographic film.\r\n\r\nThe facility is committed to minimizing the risk of adverse impacts from its operations, and our commitment to responsible operations is built directly into our business objectives.  This commitment is manifested further in our use of sound operating and maintenance practices, use of safety-conscious designs as well as extensive employee training.  In addition, the performance of periodic safety audits and incident investigations are designed to review and minimize risks to employees, the environment, and the community.\r\n\r\nThe facility continually strives to be an industry leader in environmental stewardship.  We continuously improve our practices in light of advances in technology and new understandings in safety, health and environmental science.  We make consistent, measurable progress in implementing this commitm"

The facility has voluntarily adopted Responsible Care as its environmental, health and safety code of ethics.  We measure our success by our record of improvement in safety performance, reductions in waste and emissions, and involvement with the community.\r\n\r\nCOMPANY HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn 1935, a company named Chemical Specialties, Inc. was formed to manufacture the bulk active sedative Carbromal for the US market.  This company operated at the Centennial Avenue location.  Chemical Specialties, Inc., a privately held company, owned and operated the plant from 1935 to 1947.  Miles Laboratories, Inc. owned and operated a unit at the same location from 1947 to 1977.  Hexcel Corporation owned and operated a division at the same location from 1977 to 1992.  Cambrex Corporation owned and operated the site, at the time named Zeeland Chemicals, Inc. 1992 to 2003, at which time was packaged into a division called Rutherford Chemicals, Inc.  In 2003, the Rutherford Chemicals, Inc. was acquired by Arsenal Capital Partners who later combined the division with Reilly Industries and renamed the company vertellus Specialties, Inc.  Vertellus Specialties, Inc. was purchased by Wind Point Partners in 2007. Vertellus Specialties went bankrupt in 2016, and was renamed Vertellus Zeeland LLC, owned and operated by Vertellus LLC.  \r\n\r\nThe facility provides the pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries with the highest quality active ingredients, intermediates, chiral synthons, resolving agents, and services. Our facility is registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and we maintain systems for full compliance with the US FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) guidelines.

It is a chemical industry initiative through which companies commit to a continuous effort to improve their responsible management of chemicals.  The program began in Canada in the late 1980s and has since spread across the globe.  It has rapidly become the single most important performance improvement program within the chemical industry. \r\n\r\nIn adopting Responsible Care, the facility has agreed to conduct its business according to the following principles: \r\n\r\n-To recognize and respond to community concerns about chemicals and our operations.\r\n-To develop and produce chemicals that can be manufactured, transported and disposed of safely\r\n-To make health, safety and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new products and processes.\r\n-To report promptly to officials, employees, customers and the public, information on chemical related health or environmental hazards and to recommend proactive measures.\r\n-To counsel customers on the use, transportation and disposal of chemical products.\r\n-To operate our plants and facilities in a manner that protects the environment, health and safety of our employees and the public.\r\n-To extend knowledge by conducting or supporting research on the health, safety and environmental effects of our products, processes and waste material.\r\n-To work with others to resolve problems created by past handling a"

All Responsible Care signatories agree to enact seven codes of management practice.  Zeeland Chemicals is proud of its record of accomplishment in this regard by having implemented all seven codes.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Vertellus Zeeland facility has worked hard to ensure that our products and manufacturing operations meet or exceed industry standards of excellence for protecting both the community and the environment.  As a socially responsible company, we have set aggressive goals to continue improving our EH&S performance into the next decade.  It is through these efforts that our initiatives have helped us protect and enhance health and safety -- for our employees, neighbors and the public.  As a result, we are proud of our record of accomplishment in not having had an accidental off-site release of any of the 112(r) regulated substances within the last twenty (20) years.\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nAs stated previously, the Vertellus Zeeland facility has one process covered under the 112(r) program.  The process utilizes ethylene as a raw material in the production of a copolymer.\r\n\r\nEthylene is being used in the manufacture of an ethylene/maleic anhydride (EMA) co-polymer product that is used in the glass fiber industry.  The ethylene is stored under pressure in one (1) transport tube trailer, capable of holding 15,000 pounds of ethylene.
