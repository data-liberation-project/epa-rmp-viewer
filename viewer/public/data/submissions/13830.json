In addition to plant safety program for the handling\nof chlorine, there are chlorine gas detectors in the chlorine storage and feeding rooms that detect\nchlorine at the level of 1 ppm and will activate a visual/audible alarm and scrubber system.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no release of chlorine at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response plan is presently in effect at the RE Badger facility.  The purpose of the\nemergency response plan was to aid in reaching the following objectives:\n1.  To help save lives.\n2.  Prevent and minimize accidents and injuries.\n3.  Safeguard the environment.\n4.  Safeguard private and public property.\n\nRE Badger's safety committee consists of all plant personnel who are also the designated\nemergency responders and coordinators.  The emergency response plan provides the response\norganization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and\nmitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations\nthat may arise at the RE Badger Treatment Plant.

Badger Filtration Plant emergency response plan is designed to provide the following:\n1.  To protect the lives of plant personnel and the constituents within the zone of influence.\n2.  For the purpose of mitigating personal injury.\n3.  To minimize damage to property and the environment.\n\nAll REB personnel actively participate with the safety training and planning for the facility.  The\nREB safety plan provides the personnel organization and notification needed to effectively attend\nto chlorine and ammonia release issues.  Emergency response plan identifies health hazards and\nmitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively should an emergency\nsituation arise.  The plan is a living document that is to be updated should there be any change in\nprocess or procedures.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nLocation of the RE Badger Filtration Plant is 18535 Aliso Canyon Road in Rancho Santa Fe,\nCalifornia, 92067  RE Badger Filtration Plant's initial start-up occurred in 1970.  Chlorine feed\nsystem consists of one-ton containers which are the storage vessels for chlorine.  Chlorine gas is\ndrawn from a maximum of three tanks at a time through a vacuum regulator to the Chlorinators. \nStill under vacuum from the Chlorinators, the gas is drawn to injectors and mixed with water for\ndistribution through-out the treatment plant.  Maximum chlorine stored at facility is 18 one-ton\ncylinders for a total of 36,000 pounds.\n\nHazardous Assessment Summary\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel\n- 6,000 pounds (due to a maximum of three one-ton cylinders connected to a manifold at any\ntime) in 10 minutes.  The tanks are stored enclosed in a building, therefore, passive mitigation\nmeasures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological cond"

The tanks are stored enclosed in a building, therefore, passive\nmitigation measures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5\nmeters/second wind speed, and F stability.  Reference tables from the EPA's RMP Offsite\nConsequence Analysis Guidance for Treatment Plants, along with the SLAB modeling program\nwere used.\n\nDistance to Toxic Endpoint: 1.9 miles, based on EPA's RMP Guidance for Treatment Plants.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from a 1/4 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of\nchlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 10.1 pounds per minute.  However, active and passive\nmitigation measures were incorporated since a scrubbers system is designed to pull contaminated\nchlorine gas from the room to be neutralized.  Consequently, the release rate after these measures\nwas calculated to be 3.2 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters\nper second wind speed, and D stability.  Reference tables from EPA Guidance Documents as\nwell as the SLAB modeling program were used.\n\nDistance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.1 miles, based on EPA's RMP Guidance for Water Treatment\nPlants.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RE Badger Treatment Plant has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage\nthe handling of chlorine.

This includes common practices outlined\nby the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Program, there are two chlorine\ndetectors in the chlorine storage room and one detector chlorinator room that are set to alarm at 1\nppm and will activate visual as well as audible alarms.  The chlorine scrubber system is also\nautomatically activated should the chlorine residual reach 15 ppm.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe RE Badger Treatment Plant has had no reportable release of chlorine in the past five years."
