Badger Filtration Plant emergency response plan is designed to provide the following:\n1.  To protect the lives of plant personnel and the constituents within the zone of influence.\n2.  For the purpose of mitigating personal injury.\n3.  To minimize damage to property and the environment.\n\nAll REB personnel actively participate with the safety training and planning for the facility.  The\nREB safety plan provides the personnel organization and notification needed to effectively attend\nto chlorine and ammonia release issues.  Emergency response plan identifies health hazards and\nmitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively should an emergency\nsituation arise.  The plan is a living document that is to be updated should there be any change in\nprocess or procedures.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nLocation of the RE Badger Filtration Plant is 18535 Aliso Canyon Road in Rancho Santa Fe,\nCalifornia, 92067  RE Badger Filtration Plant's initial start-up occurred in 1970.

The release rate of\nchlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 10.1 pounds per minute.  However, active and passive\nmitigation measures were incorporated since a scrubbers system is designed to pull contaminated\nchlorine gas from the room to be neutralized.  Consequently, the release rate after these measures\nwas calculated to be 3.2 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters\nper second wind speed, and D stability.
