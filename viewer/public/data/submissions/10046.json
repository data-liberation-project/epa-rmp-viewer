Harcros Organics has demonstrated this commitment through a system of  \nmanagement practices which help to ensure safe operations at this facility.  The Risk Management \nProgram is a part of our system which helps us manage risks at Harcros Organics.  The requirements of the Risk Management Program can be found in the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR Part 68,  Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Program (the RMP rule).  It is the intention of this executive summary to provide the public with a description of Harcros Organic's Risk Management and to satisfy Risk Management Plan requirements of the Risk Management Plan rule.\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\nAt this facility, we handle ethylene oxide and propylene oxide which are hazardous substances.  The same properties that make ethylene oxide and propylene oxide valuable as commodity \nchemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our  health  and to reduce the threat to nearby members \nof the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.  Harcros Organics implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  We will determine for each situation whether evacuation of employees is required.  We have an Emergency Response Plan for spills.  We will rely on public and private agencies to supplement our own response personnel.  The public agencies will notify any"

The chemicals are transferred to reactors where they are consumed in the process to make less hazardous products.  The ethoxylation and propoxylation unit produce surfactants which are used in detergents, emulsifiers, hard surface cleaners, plastics, personal care products and agricultural applications.\n\nThis facility has controlled access at all times.  The maximum storage quantity of ethylene oxide is 1.4 million pounds.  The maximum storage quantity of propylene oxide inventory is 360,000 pounds.  The average monthly inventories are much less.  The average monthly inventory of ethylene oxide is 500,000 pounds.  Propylene oxide monthly average inventory is 71,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.0 Offsite Consequence Analysis.\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a Risk Management Plan regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  Evaluation of both the worst-case scenario and alternative release scenarios are used for the offsite consequence analysis.  Harcros Organics does not expect a worst-case release  scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario is considered a more likely scenario.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis determines the distance (called the end point distance) at which an accidental released regulated toxic substance could reach under a predetermined set of conditions.\n\nThe worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenarios.  Alternative release scenarios include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.  \n\nWorst-case scenario - Failure of a full 85 ton (170,000 pound) railcar of ethylene oxide.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released and vaporized in 10 minutes.  The distance to the toxic end point of 0.09 mg/L is 8.7 miles as determined by the EPA's"

Public receptors include schools, residences, public recreational areas, an arena, hospitals,  office and industrial areas.  No environmental receptors are within this distance.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ethylene oxide) - A runaway reaction releases 1,000 pounds of ethylene oxide in 10 minutes through the vessel's pressure relief valve.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (as determined by RMP Comp) is 0.30 miles.  There are no residences or schools within this distance.  Public receptors include industrial areas.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (propylene oxide) - A hole in the bottom of the propylene oxide railcar releases 4160 pounds of propylene oxide in 10 minutes.  This scenario is not based on any actual event.  The distance, to the toxic endpoint of 0.059 mg/L, is 0.30 miles as determined by RMP Comp.  There are no residences or schools within this distance.

A drain valve was not fully closed which allowed ethylene oxide leak approximately 100 pounds under the snow.  An operator correctly isolated the pump and washed down the snow to the waste water treatment tank.\n\nOn May 14, 1998, ethylene oxide was released from a reactor through a pressure relief valve which instantaneously released and resealed.  The operator correctly vented excess pressure through the scrubber to eliminate any additional release.  Although the investigation committee could not determine the exact amount of ethylene oxide released, it was estimated that over 10 pounds of ethylene oxide was released.\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\nHarcros Organics has established a written emergency action plan and emergency response plan. We coordinate emergency response procedures with the local fire department.  Harcros Organics employees will respond to minor events that do not have potential for significant effects (e.g. small fires or small leaks).  In the event of a larger fire or release, employees evacuate the area and contact the local fire department.\n\n\n7.0 Planned changes to improve safety\nHarcros Organics strive to improve the safety of our processes through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigations programs, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from employees.  The follow types of changes are planned during the next 5 years.\n\n\tRevised process instrumentation and or control in the ethylene oxide/propylene oxide unit.\n\n\tRevisions to training programs.\n\n\tRevised written"

A management committee is established to properly address and resolve incident report findings and recommendations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings and are tracked until they are complete.\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\nThrough process safety management, the hazards associated with ethylene oxide/propylene oxide processes are managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program summarized previously is applied to covered processes at Harcros Organics.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Harcros Organics has safety features on the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide process units to help contain and control a release, (2) quickly detect a release and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features used are:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\t Flammable Gas Detectors with alarms.\n\t Process alarms.\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\t Process relief valves\n\t Scrubber to solubilize ethylene oxide / propylene oxide\n\t Valves to permit isolation of the process.\n\t Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g. high level, high\t\t   pressure, high temperature).\n\t Trench system to contain liquid releases which flow to equalization tank.\n\t Back up fire water tank and fire water pump.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\t Deluge system for specific equipment.\n\t Trained personnel to assist emergency responders.\n\t Personal protective equipment (e.g. protective clothing, self-contained breathin apparatus.\n\t.Blast-resistant"
