      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  LADWP has been operating the Encino Chlorination Station (ECS) since 1956, which is a chlorination facility that stores and uses anhydrous chlorine for disinfection purposes.  LADWP decided to make significant changes to the existing chlorination facility to further enhance the safety and offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release. The modified chlorination facility is in operation since 2006. The modified Encino chlorination station chlorine handling process is also subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan, and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations.  EPA and CalARP regulations require the preparation and five year update of the Risk Management Plan for facilities subject to federal EPA and CalARP regulations. An update is required at least once every five years from the date of its initial submission.  An update is also required within six months of a change that alters the Program Level that applied to any covered process.\n\nThe RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.

Subsequent to the preparation of the Risk Management Program in April 2006, a few minor changes in the piping system were made.  An update to the April 2006 Risk Management Plan, reflecting these minor changes was prepared in December 2006.  LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs from 1999 through 2006 because Encino Chlorination Station is not subject to PSM regulations. However, in the excess of caution, LADWP has now decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP for the Encino facility. Thus, this 2010 update of the Risk Management Plan for the Encino facility demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.  It should be noted that no changes have been made to the Encino Chlorination Station after the preparation of the December 2006 Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\nA?    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nA?    General facility and regulated substances information.\nA?

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPAA?s Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials "

The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Encino Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Encino Chlorination Station has a good record in preventing accidents from occurring. \n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Encino Chlorination Station is located at 4500 Encino Avenue, Encino, California.  The station serves to disinfect drinking water by chlorinating water in the reservoir and at various locations in the on-site water piping system.  The treated water is then piped into the distribution network, which serves parts of the San Fernando Valley with potable water.  The station consists of a three building complex: the pump station, the chlorination station and the membrane filtration plant. The facility stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. Chlorine containers can be attached to the liquid chlorine header for discharging chlorine, as well as to the gas header which provides an automatic backup supply. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Encino chlorination station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms, which may occur.

On-line containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in each container. All on-line containers are equipped with automatic closure actuators on the container valves. The primary bank is connected to the chlorine liquid header and the secondary bank is connected to the chlorine gas header.  The liquid chlorine passes from the containers to the evaporator where it is vaporized in a water bath.  Gas from the secondary bank of containers bypasses the evaporators, serving as an automatic backup when the primary containers run dry, or when the evaporators shut down due to (1) a low water level, (2) low temperature condition, or (3) power loss.  Space is allocated in the room for the storage of additional chlorine containers without any connection to the chlorination system.\n\nThe gas header line is equipped with automatic switchover vacuum regulating valves, and pressure gauges.  The liquid header line is equipped with pressure gauges and an expansion chamber to protect against excessive pressure.  The primary (liquid) bank provides all the chlorine to the station through the evaporators until it is depleted.  The gaseous chlorine bank automatically starts supplying chlorine when the primary bank is depleted.  This automatic system is achieved by setting the automatic vacuum regulating valve leading from the secondary bank to standby.  Once the primary bank is depleted, the higher vacuum level acts on the diaphragm of the automatic switchover vacuum regulating in the secondary bank, thereby pulling that valve open to start feeding gas.\n\nThe gaseous chlorine from the evaporators or from the chlorine gas header proceeds to the chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.

The solution is then piped through diffusers into the reservoir and to various locations in the on-site water piping system.\n\nA dry media type chlorine gas scrubber system is installed at the station.  The unit is actuated by chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm.  The scrubber is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from the chlorine storage or chlorinator rooms.  The scrubber draws suction from the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms through a duct.  The station is equipped with uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in addition to a backup power generator.  Therefore, in case of the failure of regular power, the scrubber will be functional.\n\nChlorine leak sensors are provided to detect chlorine leaks in the chlorine storage room, the chlorinator room and the chlorine scrubber room.  The detectors activate an alarm system which includes:  (1) flashing red lights over the entry door to the building, (2) audible and flashing alarms within the chlorination building, and (3) an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.  Also, the chlorine injector vaults are equipped with chlorine leak sensors.\n\nProcess control is by a programmable controller, which determines the feed rate relative to the water flow rate.
