              "Description": "The Wattenberg plant process is a OSHA 1910.119 covered facility and consequently adheres to the 14 elements of Process Safety Management: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Safety, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, IncidentInvestigation, Emergency Preparedness, PSM Audits and Trade Secrets. The Wattenberg Plant utilizes numerous prevention techniques throughout the plant process such as: LEL/Fire detection with shutdown functionality in the process buildings, H2S detection with shutdown functionality in the Product Treating Building, an Emergency Shutdown System that can be activated manually from various remote locations or automatically in the event of a high level in various process vessels as well as temperature/pressure/flow shutdown protection functionality. The process equipment is protected by Pressure Safety Valves that will vent either to flare or atmosphere as well as pressure control valves that will vent to flare. The plant utilizes a Distributive Control System to monitor/control process parameters and warns operators of process parameters outside of normal operating ranges. Trained Operators and Operating Procedures are an important part of our prevention program. A fire water system is located throughout the facility and is used primarily for maintenance but can also be used to cool vessels in the event of an emergency. The Wattenberg Plant has a SPCC program with spill control materials on site. The facility is equipped with fire extinguishers throughout the facility for incipient stage fire control.  Monthly safety meetings provide training on required topics such as: Hot Work, Confined Space, SPCC, Emergency Response, Safe Driving, H2S and Respiratory protection, LOTO, Ground Disturbance, Hazcom, Disposal of hazardous waste, Fire training, CPR/First Aid and AED training, Site Security, Hearing conservation as well as other topics. Emergency response drills are conducted annually. The plant facility is access controlled with fencing and has three cameras to monitor the parameter for security control. Dikes are installed around the following storage tanks: Engine/Compressor lubricating oil, Ambitrol NTF-50, ChemTherm 550, Waste Oil, the Flare Tank, C4+ storage tank and Methanol storage tanks.",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Wattenberg Gas Plant was built in 1974 to extract natural gas liquids, commonly referred to as NGL's from produced natural gas via a cryogenic separation process.  These natural gas liquids are primarily used as chemical feed stocks, octane enhancers for gasoline, and as fuel.  NGL liquids include ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.  \n\n\n\nNatural gas liquids produced from the plant are shipped out via OPPL's product pipeline.  The facility has the flexibility to ship lower vapor pressure product via a Rail Loading System into tank cars. Shipping by rail would not be the preferred or the normal mode of shipment. The remaining lean residue gas, consisting primarily of methane, is shipped out through four outlets via pipeline to Kinder MOrgan Pipeline Company and Xcel Energy, (local utility).  This gas is used for industrial and residential fuel.  In addition to the NGL product, a specification propane product is produced and sold via truck to local markets.\n\nThe Wattenberg Gas Plant utilizes nine (9) unit operations to precondition produced gas, extract NGL's, and refine the separated NGL's to specification products.  The unit operations include:\n\n\n\nSlug Liquid Separation / Handling\n\nInlet Gas Dehydration\n\nCyrogenic Expansion             \n\nDistillation (Demethanizer)\n\nResidue Compression            \n\nAir Injection\n\nLiquid Product Treating / Storage    \n\nFractionation\n\n100 MM"

These include steam and hot oil systems for process heat, propane refrigeration for process cooling upstream of the expanders and within the product treating unit, electrical generation using a gas fired turbine, and instrument air.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Wattenberg Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Wattenberg Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open "

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Wattenberg Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nThe Wattenberg Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team "

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Wattenberg Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator works with senior operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Wattenberg Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: \n\n(1) perform their work in a safe manner; \n\n(2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills; \n\n(3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace; \n\n(4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency; \n\n(5) understand and follow site safety rules, and;"

Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Wattenberg Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction has been completed in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Wattenberg Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
