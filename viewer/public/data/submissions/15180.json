      "SummaryText": "Mesmer Fertilizer is an agricultural chemical and fertilizer center located in Bethel, MO.  We have been in business at the present location for 30 years.  We supply farmers with dry fertilizer, chemical (herbicides, insecticides), and anhyrous ammonia (NH3).  We strive for safety at our plant.  We are in compliance with DNR regulations for containment.  We have filed emergency response plans with state and local authorities.  We are now striving to be in compliance with the EPA RMP plans.  Anhyrous Ammonia is the process for which we are reporting.  To this end, we are ensuring that we are in compliance with its' regulations.  We train employees in the proper way to handle NH3, chemicals and fertilizers.  We wish to protect the farmers we work with as well as the community we live and work in.  We attempt to educate farmers on the proper handling and usage of NH3 equipment.  We inspect equipment on a daily basis during peak seasons and every two weeks during off peak seasons.  Our NH3 facility is located approximately one half mile (.5 miles) outside of the city limits of Bethel.  \nOur center provides fertilizer and chemical services to the agricultural community in our area.  We use dry fertlizer, chemicals, and NH3 in the operation of our facility.  Our main building is located at 168 W. First St. on the south end of Bethel.  We have an above ground, locked room to store the chemicals that we use.  Only authorized personnel are allowed in that room.  Fertilizer bins are located at the rear of the main building (south side).  These bins are also secured when not in use.  We have installed a DNR approved containment structure in which we mix chemicals and blend fertilizer.  Our NH3 facility is located one half mile (.5 miles) north of Bethel.  At most, we keep 120000 pounds of NH3 in two storage tanks (18000 gal. and 12000 gal. filled to 82%).  We rarely keep this much however.  During peak times, it goes out as fast as it comes in.  Peak times occur in the spring "

We are using the recommended 10 minute release time with a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  Our 66000 pounds would release at a rate of 6600 pounds/minute.  Our endpoint would be .9 miles in all directions.  Within this circle, there is one town (Bethel) located approximately one half mile from NH3 site.  Bethel has an approximate populations of 130 people.  There are also several residences within this circle.  There are no other public receptors or environmental receptors in the area.  We would contact local officials in case of an accidental release to keep off site impacts to a minimum.  The other scenario is a transfer hose failure.  We chose this scenario because it is one of the most likely to occur.  The leak would be approximately 4000 pounds in two (2) minutes.  The release rate would be 2000 pounds/minute with a wind speed of 3 m/sec.  The endpoint would be four tenths of a mile (.4 mile) in all directions.  Bethel is located one half mile from the NH3 site and would be just outside of the circle.  There are no other residences within that area.  There are no other public or environmental receptors in this area.  There would be very little off site impact as the closest receptors are just outside of this circle.\nWe attempt to stay on top of all OSHA, EPA, and DNR regulations.  We check equipment on a daily basis during peak seasons and every 15 days during non-peak times.  Equipment is checked for leaks, etc.  We check to make sure valves are not leaking.  Hoses are checked for leaks and cracks.  Wheelbearing and hitch pins are also checked on nurse tanks for faults that could result in an accident (loosing a wheel, disconnecting from towing vehicle, etc.)  All equipment is fitted with manual shut offs, relief and check valves, and excess flow devices.  We also go over safety procedures before peaktime of each year.  Employees are obser"

We encourage the use of goggles and gloves and provide this equipment when it is requested.  \nWe have not had any reportable accidents in the last five years.\nWe have filed emergency response plans with the state and local emergeny planning commisions.  We have also filed with the local fire department.  Our response plan calls for the emergency responders to take care of rescue and medical duties.  We will notify the proper authorities in the case of an accidental release.  We keep emergency numbers posted by each phone.  When training, we go over the emergency reponse plan and actions employees are to take in a given situation.  As stated earlier, we go over these safety measures with employees before the beginning of the peak seasons.  We work with local agencies (LEPC, Fire Department, etc.) to ensure public safety.\nWe plan to stay on top of any OSHA, EPA, and DNR regulations that pertain to our facility and make whatever updates necessary.  We will continue tp train employees in safe handling and use of NH3.  We will also continue to inform our customers of safety issues.  As new safety equipment becomes available, we will use it to ensure the public safety in our area."
