      "SummaryText": "The owners,   management  and employees of the DeLong Co., Inc. are committed  to the\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia   Through training local \nemergency responders and  employees, if  an accidental release should occur the facility \nis prepared  to work with the  local fire department   or other authorities to mitigate any\nrelease and impact of the release to people and the environment.\nFACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe DeLong Co., Inc. is a member of the Fertilizer 100.   Meaning  they are one of the largest 100 fertilizer dealers in the nation and one of the biggest in WI. They  employ more  than \n85 people company wide. There are actually five divisions   in The DeLong Co., Inc.  Chick DeLong  is in charge of feed.  Bo DeLong is in charge of grain.  Dan DeLong is in charge of  DeLco Transport.  Steve Quade is in charge of the  seed division. David DeLong, president, is in charge of fertilizer and chemicals.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage, distribution and application of  anhydrous ammonia for stateline area farmers.  The maximum  quantity stored would be 140,196 lbs. in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 lbs.\n\n WORST-CASE\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of  the entire contents of a storage tank or tank car released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 150,000 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion  to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history or the most likely\npotential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint\n(point of  dispersion to 200 ppm ) is 0.41 miles.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirement"
