This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Energy Transfer policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF MOCANE GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer operates the Mocane Gas Processing Plant located in Beaver County, Oklahoma.  The Mocane Gas Processing Plant is primarily involved in the recovery of hydrocarbons from a gas stream.  As part of this process, Energy Transfer handles the regulated, flammable substances methane, ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  Based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Mocane Gas Processing Plant is a Program 3 process.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program at the Mocane Gas Processing Plant.  Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nRGS and the Mocane Gas Processing Plant actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.  This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an emplo"

This information addresses the physical properties of hazardous substances handled, operating parameters of the equipment, and design basis and configuration of the equipment.  RGS ensures that this process safety information is available to all RGS employees, the LEPC and the fire department.\r\n\r\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Mocane Gas Processing Plant, including regulated substances in covered processes.  The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes toxicity information and permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity and corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazards of mixing substances in the process.  MSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the Plant's MSDS book so the personnel have ready reference to this information.  In addition, MSDSs are provided to the LEPC and the fire department for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.\r\n\r\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.  The available information includes operating parameters, block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, process chemistry, maximum intended inventories, safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure or flow, consequences of deviations from established operating limits, design basis and configuration of equipment, piping and instrument diagrams including materials of construction, electrical classification, safety systems, applicable design codes and standards, and design basis for relief and ventilation systems.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Mocane Gas Processing Plant uses a combination of \"What If\" analysis and checklists to perform these evaluations.  \"What If\" analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Mocane Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial start-"

Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Mocane Gas Processing Plant maintains Operating Procedures, which provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific processes or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the Mocane Gas Processing Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a qualified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.\r\n\r\nOperators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  Documentation is maintained at the plant, which certifies on-the-job experience for each operator.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nThe Mocane Gas Processing Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.

In addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Mocane Gas Processing Plant conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specification, that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that training of each employee involved in operating the process or equipment has been completed.
