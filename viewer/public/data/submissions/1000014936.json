Howell Road,\nWilliamston, MI, 48895\n\nExecutive Summary\nRisk Management Plan\nNovember, 2010\n\nCremer Farm Center is a family operated retail agricultural sales business, selling anhydrous ammonia, ammonium nitrate fertilizers and other agricultural products to local farms in area.  The same owners also use these fertilizer products, pesticides and other agricultural products at Cremer Farms, an active farm located at the same address.   The business was started in 1974; however the property was a family farm prior to the business incorporation.   Currently there 7 full time and one part time employees involved with the business.  Cremer Farm Center is located in a rural area in southeast Ingham County, Michigan with the closest non-family home located approximately 1/3 mile to the east of the site. \n\nCremer has one 18,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank that has been on the property since 1967, a 100 ton ammonium nitrate 28% liquid fertilizer storage tank and three 1100 above ground diesel fuel storage tanks.  The liquid fertilizer tank and the diesel tank farm each have secondary containment.  There are also approximately 10-12 anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks stored at the business. These are usually stored empty and filled just prior to use. \n\nCremer Farm Center has an Emergency Response Plan that has been in place since 2000.  It has been amended periodically as needed. The two owners who also work on the farm are the Emergency Response Coordinators and are responsible for all activities at Cremer Farm Center and Cremer Farms.   The business operation has a good safety record and regularly communicates with employees and local emergency response personnel on safety issues.   \n\nThe only chemical related accident that has happened in the past five years resulted from an attempted theft of anhydrous ammonia from one of the nurse tanks.  It is believed that a valve connecting a hose was cracked during the theft attempt allowing 1900 pound"
