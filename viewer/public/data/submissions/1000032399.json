No other accident history information had appeared in the previous version of the RMP as no other accidents had occurred in the past five years.  The DuPont Wurtland Plant is a facility reporting under Program 3 and the RMP has also been revised to include the incident investigation information in section 7.  Specifically, the date of investigation and the expected date of completion of changes to reflect actions taken as a result of the accident have been revised.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nDuPont's Wurtland Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Wurtland Plant manufactures and processes sulfuric acid in Greenup County Kentucky.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are in use at the site.\n\n\n\nThe Wurtland Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, DuPont identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses three regulated substances in the sulfuric acid process, oleum, sulfur trioxide, and anhydrous hydrogen chloride (Process 1).  In addition,  railcars containing oleum and anhydrous hydrogen chloride ar"

In addition, DuPont is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code 2819.  Therefore, the sulfuric acid process and the railcar storage area are classified as Program 3 under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Releases\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances\n\n\n\nThe endpoint for the worst-case release of a flammable substance is 1 psi overpressure (i.e. 15.7 psia) for vapor cloud explosions. DuPont Wurtland Plant does not store any flammable substances listed in the rule in the threshold quantities required by the regulation; therefore, DuPont does not have a worst-case scenario for flammable substances.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances\n\n\n\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints). Each of the regulated toxic substances at the Wurtland Plant was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to an endpoint.\n\n\n\nFor the oleum storage vessel, administrative controls exist in which the tank is only filled to 90% capacity.  Alarms are in place to ensure that the tank is never filled over 90% of the capacity. \n\n\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint resulting from the instantaneous release of the contents of the oleum tank and an anhydrous hydrogen chloride railcar would have an off-site impact.

Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  Each of the regulated toxic substances at the Wurtland Plant was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to an endpoint.\n\n\n\nAlternative Releases\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.   \n\n\n\nToxic Substances\n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for the regulated toxic substances, oleum, sulfur trioxide, and anhydrous hydrogen chloride at the Wurtland Plant.\n\n\n\nFor oleum, it was assumed that a 4-inch nozzle valve line fails.  This area is not diked, but the pump can be shutdown and flow stopped within a maximum time period of 10 minutes.  This release has an off-site impact, and has off-site impact on the residential population, as determined by the OCA Guidance and the \"Landview\" program census data.\n\n\n\nFor sulfur trioxide, it was assumed that a 2-inch loading hose breaks.

Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA's risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nDuPont encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Wurtland Plant's accident prevention program. One way that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is our Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) Committee.

The teams have members from all areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Wurtland Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the sulfuric acid process area, Wurtland  has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature level, composition) in a Standard Conditions Manual.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using state-of-the-art process controls and monitoring instruments, emergency relief systems with flare, redundant power supply and safety systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nWurtland  primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Wurtland  periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nThis information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Wurtland  has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Wurtland  evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\n\n\nWurtland  conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

The #2 Oleum Reboiler condensate line leaked when acidic condensate corroded a steam condensate exit elbow below the steam chest releasing fuming acid into the atmosphere at 2:35 PM on 10/11/04.  The condensate turned acidic due to a leak in the steam heating tube bundle.  The resulting sulfuric acid mist traveled across an industrial park and reached US Highway 23.  Operators immediately shut off flows to the reboiler, began external water and foam application, and began clearing the reboiler.  At about 2:50 PM the local emergency response agency, state agencies, and the National Response Center were contacted.  Off-site fuming stopped at about 3:25 PM.  Highway 23 was barricaded by local authorities and a precautionary shelter-in-place was requested for the local community and nearby industrial neighbors primarily to keep people off the barricaded road.  Small wisps of fumes continued to be released intermittently on site in the direct vicinity of the #2 oleum reboiler until the mechanics removed the damaged condensate elbow and blind flanged the condensate nozzle to isolate the #2 oleum reboiler between 4:30 P. M. and 5:00 P. M.  All clear was sounded at 5:42 PM, the highway was re-opened and the precautionary shelterA?inA?place lifted.
