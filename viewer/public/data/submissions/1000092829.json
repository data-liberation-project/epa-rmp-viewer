Pierce (Tropicana) maintains a strong commitment to protecting both the worker and the surrounding community from any type of hazardous incident that could potentially occur at its facility.  For this purpose Tropicana has developed facility procedures that apply to both daily operations and emergency response situations, in the form of a Risk Management Program, developed and implemented specifically for the Ft. Pierce facility.  The facility risk management program has been developed in accordance with federal (EPA's Risk Management Program, 40 CFR 68) and state (Florida Department of Community Affairs Accidental Release Program) requirements.\n\n\n\nTropicana is in Ft. Pierce, St. Lucie County, Florida, situated on, approximately, 315 acres of property.   The plant was originally built in 1973.  The facility is a citrus processing plant producing citrus juices and concentrate, d'limonene and animal feed. \n\n\n\nTropicana chilled juices require constant refrigeration to maintain their high quality and freshness.  Refrigeration at the facility is provided by an anhydrous ammonia system.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is used instead of other refrigerants because ammonia has several advantages over the available alternatives.  Ammonia is a very energy efficient refrigerant, does not cause damage to the ozone, and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  \n\n\n\nTropicana complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standards (29 CFR 1910.119), incorporating technology, procedures, and management practices into a comprehensive program that effectively minimizes the potential for hazardous chemical releases.  In addition to mitigation systems (automatic shut-off valves, high pressure relief valves, level alarms, barricades, monitoring/detection systems) engineered into the refrigeration system, Tropicana promotes safety in the operation of the ammonia system, by the following PSM program elements:\n\n\n\n1.

Internal audits, identifying any areas of program noncompliance and corrective actions required.\n\n \n\nThere have been no accidents in the last five years from the ammonia refrigeration system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site; or, off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n \n\nThe Tropicana on-site emergency response program entails the organization of a trained emergency response team, capable of implementing established response procedures.  These procedures include response as a stand-alone response unit (on-site personnel only), or in conjunction with off-site authorities.  The facility utilizes the Incident Command System for all response activities, as outlined in the current facility Emergency Response Plan.  On-site capabilities include responses to fires; non-consequential ammonia releases (such as normal operating losses and small, non-impacting sudden occurrences, etc); hazardous material spills; product (juice) releases;  confined space and high angle rescue, first responder medical assistance; bomb threats; and, workplace violence ev"

This includes evaluations of existing programs relative to any changes in facility operations, as well as recommendations that arise from incidents, such as injuries or near misses. Since all measures identified have already been implemented to date there are no current planned changes to further improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nTropicana has, and will continue to be, an industry leader in assuring the proper and safe operation of its ammonia refrigeration system.  This leadership is exemplified by Tropicana employees at all organizational levels and is the basis for the company's commitment to maintaining a comprehensive risk management program, minimizing the potential for accidental releases."
