We are strongly committed to safety by maintaining comprehensive maintenance, prevention, and industrial safety programs that protect against any accidental release or spill which may result in on- or off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event of a mishap, an emergency response plan has been developed in cooperation with the Sumter County Emergency Management Agency, which serves to ensure the safety and well being of the community and the environment.  Our emergency response program is based upon the recommendations by The Chlorine Institute, Inc. within the \"Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\"       \n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored on-site for use in the disinfection process of treated wastewater prior to final discharge.  Ten 2,000-pound pressurized chlorine cylinders are located within an enclosed building south of the treatment ponds for use in the treatment process.  Five chlorine cylinders will be hooked up in use and five cylinders will be hooked up ready for stand-by usage.  Six 2000-pound pressurized sulfur dioxide cylinders are located in a separate storage building for use in the dechlorination process.  Three sulfur dioxide cylinders will be hooked up in use and three cylinders will be hooked up ready for stand-by usage.  Additionally ~forty 150-pound chlorine (~20 full and ~20 empty) cylinders are properly stored on-site prior to transport and use at other off-site facilities.  The latest technology in process control systems are present in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage areas to minimize and prevent the impacts of any spillage, fire, explosion, or equipment failure.            \n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThe Pocotaligo Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental release over the past 1"

Details for each chosen scenario has been provided in the following paragraphs.\n\n \n\nChlorine\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as developed for the chlorination system, involves a catastrophic release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from one of the ten chlorine cylinders within the chlorine building that are connected to the chlorination process.  It has been assumed that the entire quantity of chlorine is released as a gas over a 10 minute time frame as a result of a tank rupture.

Industrial facilities, schools, hospitals, recreational areas, farms, residential subdivisions, creeks, ponds, and rivers would be affected by such a release. The EPA's RMP*Comp program was used to determine end point distances for all scenarios.    \n\n\n\nAn alternative scenario may include the catastrophic release of chlorine gas during 3 m/s windspeeds, D Class atmospheric stability, and  77 degrees fahrenheit weather conditions.  It has been assumed that a quantity of chlorine gas is released at a rate of 3.3 pounds per minute from the storage cylinders as a result of a pipe rupture within the chlorination building.
