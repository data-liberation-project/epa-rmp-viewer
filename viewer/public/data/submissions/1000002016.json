The facility has a large shuttered ventilation opening at the end opposite the large roll up door. The opening is screened over to prevent birds and other indigenous wildlife from entering the facility. The facility is heated during the winter months and cooled during the summer months. There is a single deep sink in the facility used for hand washing after maintenance tasks. The facility has two (2) internal atmosphere monitoring ports, one located at each end of the facility. The monitoring system has preset alarm levels that upon being triggered sound the alarm within the facility and sends an alarm signal to the NAWS China Lake Fire Division.  Additionally there are manual alarm push button switches. The facility has a windsock installed to indicate wind direction in case of a release. At capacity the wastewater treatme"

      "SummaryText": "nt system facility contains 3704 pounds of chlorine gas on line.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been a single minor accidental release in the past 5 years. The accidental release occurred on 30 August 2002. A faulty fitting caused the minor release.  The fitting was promptly replaced and the system put back into operation. The released chlorine gas was approximately 1 pound, well below the reporting threshold of 10 pounds, and caused no injuries and had no impact on any environmental resources.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nNAWS China Lake represents a complete functioning community with its own fire, police, medical, explosive ordnance disposal, analytic chemistry, and public works support divisions. Under any emergency condition all equipment and support personnel are immediately available. Prominent notices delineating all emergency assistance information are posted in all buildings and work areas.\n\nNAWS China Lake has its own Fire Division that operates from three (3) different fire stations on base. All buildings on base have the OSHA required type and number of fire extinguishers. All fire extinguishers and other pieces of emergency equipment are monitored, tested, and maintained by the OSH office and the Fire Division. \n\nNAWS China Lake personnel are responsible for all spill and disaster management actions on base. If an emergency situation arises at NAWS China Lake the Fire Division and Branch Medical Clinic will assist in providing emergency transportation of victims of the disaster to the Ridgecrest Regional Hospital and/or other critical care facilities.\n\nCertified hazardous waste removal and a transportation company are on contract for situations beyond the ability of our spill response crew.\n\nNAWS China Lake works closely with the Indian Wells Valley Emergency Services Committee, which is headed by the City Manager for the City of Ridgecrest, CA.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\n\nAGENCY NOTIFICATION: Personnel working in the Wastewater Chlorine S"

The Safety and Industrial Hygiene offices perform routine inspections and identified problem areas are cited for immediate correction. \n\nMITIGATION: Efforts are under way to reduce the amount of hazardous materials being used. The storage of smaller quantities of material will lessen the chance of a significant incident.\n\nABATEMENT: In an emergency situation the Fire Division is immediately notified either by telephone or the alarm system. The incident is then assessed for hazardous consequences. Either the spill cleanup crew or the Emergency Response Team is notified and the proper regulatory agencies are contacted. The incident is then remediated in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nTRAINING: NAWS China Lake training is provided by various organizational elements. The OSH office provides Hazard Communication training including specific hazard training via the Chief of Navy Installations web site. The Environmental Planning and Management Department provides initial HAZWOPER and annual refresher training. The Fire Division provides training on Disaster Preparedness as well as the proper use of fire extinguishers. Additionally, each organizational element provides Safety training on topics specific to their operations. Training records are maintained for three (3) years at the OSH office.\n\nALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES/PROCESSES: NAWS China Lake performed a feasibility study on changing from chlorine gas for its wastewater treatment to a concentrated solution of sodium hypochlorite.

      "SummaryText": "hat the change of process chemistry involved much more than a simple \"drop-in\" replacement. Aside from the Hypochlorite solution, other supporting chemicals had to be used. The change would have additionally required major construction to our facility and the procurement and installation of additional reaction vessels. This would have necessitated the initiation of a Military Construction (MILCON) request. If granted the MILCON would, in and of itself, have been cost prohibitive without factoring in the additional cost of the reaction vessels, addition chemicals, and increased manpower to operate the new process. For these reasons the change was deemed not feasible at this time. NAWS China Lake continues to watch for alternative technologies and processes for its wastewater treatment system."
