      "SummaryText": "JohnsonDiversey, Inc. (JDI) is a leading global provider of cleaning and hygiene solutions to the institutional and industrial marketplace.   JDI\u00bfs  Pleasant Prairie Warehouse (108), located at 8505 100th Street in Pleasant Prairie , Wisconsin, is used to store packaged finished goods prior to their distribution.  Because JDI stores aerosol products at the  Warehouse, the site has the potential to exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for flammable substances that are used as propellants in aerosol cans.  Therefore, JDI is submitting a predictive filing for flammable substances.\n\nThe worst-case scenario performed, based on the TNT-Equivalency Method presented in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure will not extend beyond the Pleasant Prairie Warehouse\u00bfs property line.  Therefore, no public or environmental receptors are impacted.\n\nAn emergency response plan is maintained at the Pleasant Prairie Warehouse and reviewed annually to identify potential plan updates recommended to improve site safety.  No accidental releases of regulated flammable substances have occurred at the Pleasant Prairie Warehouse in the last 5 years.  Coordination of emergency response activities is facilitated by the site\u00bfs inclusion in the Kenosha County\u00bfs Office of Emergency Management offsite response plan and by compliance with the annual chemical inventory filing requirements of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act program."
