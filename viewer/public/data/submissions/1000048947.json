Employees are encouraged to take responsibility for safety.  AECI's Thomas Hill Energy Center has 3 coal-fired electrical generating units.  Ammonia, up to 612,000 pounds, will be needed to operate the 4 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices which have been retrofitted to each unit, with 1 each on Units 1&2 and 2 SCRs being needed to treat the flue gas from Generating Unit #3.  The SCRs capture Nitrogen Oxides (Nox) in the discharge gas stream by injecting ammonia gas into the flow and then chemically changing the NOx state as it passes through layers of catalyst.   The ammonia process will consist of tank storage (4 30,000 gallon tanks), with piping to vaporization systems located on each SCR structure.  Once vaporized, the ammonia will be piped to the injection ring within the ductwork where it will react with the Nox in the flue gas.  Generally, accidental release prevention will center around an aggressive preventative maintenance program involving frequent system inspections and checks.  The program will comply with the OSHA process safety management program.  Ammonia has not been onsite since 2011(commission date is projected for 3/3/15).  There have been no accidents associated with ammonia in the past 5 years.  The plant has a good safety record overall, and trains its own emergency response team (ERT).  Volunteer employee team members receive about 20 hours of training per quarter.  The team also interacts with the local volunteer fire departments and the Randolph County LEPC.  In addition, the security staff employees certified emergency medical technicians and the plant has its own ambulance.  On 2/23/2015, AECI sent a letter with email confirmation to the Randolph County LEPC informing them about the upcoming ammonia deliveries and the safety program in place and developing at the power plant.

The compliance audit discussed in Section 7.10a, (the date of the most recent compliance audit) is longer than 3 yeaars due to the inactivity of the system.  The tanks were evacuated, with no ammonia onsiste and the system was completely inactivated."
