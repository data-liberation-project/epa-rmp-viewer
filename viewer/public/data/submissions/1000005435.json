Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: At this warehouse and distribution facility we handle Propylene Oxide, Ammonia (anhydrous) and Formaldehyde which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  In such case this makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these products to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal safety and health as well as our employees, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we store these hazardous chemicals, combined with the safe handling procedures, and the training of our employees.\n\nOur emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency response agency.\n\n2.  The storage facility and regulated substances handled:  The primary purpose of this facility is to warehouse and distribute industrial and agricultural chemicals, both hazardous and non-hazardous, plus many non chemical items such as polyethylene sheeting, rope &  twines, vineyard and tree wire to both wholesale and retail customers.  The products considered hazardous by the EPA are,  (a)  Propylene Oxide which is packaged in 55 gal drums and is used by food processing plants as a commodity fumigant. (b)  Formaldehyde which is packaged in 480 pound drums and used in the dairy industry.  These products are delivered to our facility by trucks and stored inside are warehouse, or outside on our storage docks.  This facility has equipment for unloading trucks and loading trucks of all types and sizes.  Access to our fenced and gated property is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized mangement personnel and authorized customers.\n\nThe maximum amount of Propylene Oxide that can be stored at this facility is 71,000 pounds.\n\n\n                          \nThe maximum amount of Formaldehyde that can be stored at this faci"

The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:  This warehouse facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  All employees have been thoroughly trained and certified in thier specific job duties.\n\n5. Five-year accident history:  None\n\n6. The emergency response program:  In the event of a very small spill employees are instructed to follow procedures of the Hazard Material Business Plan.  Employees do not respond to hazard material releases on site. In the event of a hazard material release employees are instructed and trained to call 911 and evacuate.  This plan has been coordinated with the Stanislaus County Emergency Response Agency.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:  At this time there are no planned changes. This facility will contune to operate in the safe manner it has for the past 25 years. As long as this facility has operated at this location, we have never had an accident or a release of these chemicals into the environment."
