Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: At this warehouse and distribution facility we handle Propylene Oxide, Ammonia (anhydrous) and Formaldehyde which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  In such case this makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these products to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal safety and health as well as our employees, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we store these hazardous chemicals, combined with the safe handling procedures, and the training of our employees.\n\nOur emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency response agency.\n\n2.  The storage facility and regulated substances handled:  The primary purpose of this facility is to warehouse and distribute industrial and agricultural chemicals, both hazardous and non-hazardous, plus many non chemical items such as polyethylene sheeting, rope &  twines, vineyard and tree wire to both wholesale and retail customers.  The products considered hazardous by the EPA are,  (a)  Propylene Oxide which is packaged in 55 gal drums and is used by food processing plants as a commodity fumigant. (b)  Formaldehyde which is packaged in 480 pound drums and used in the dairy industry.  These products are delivered to our facility by trucks and stored inside are warehouse, or outside on our storage docks.  This facility has equipment for unloading trucks and loading trucks of all types and sizes.  Access to our fenced and gated property is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized mangement personnel and authorized customers.\n\nThe maximum amount of Propylene Oxide that can be stored at this facility is 71,000 pounds.\n\n\n                          \nThe maximum amount of Formaldehyde that can be stored at this faci"
