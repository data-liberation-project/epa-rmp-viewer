We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This Executive Summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n?    A description of Memphis Cellulose and the use of chlorine, which is regulated by EPA's RMP regulation,\n\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs,\n\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chlorine,\n\n?    An overview of our emergency response programs,\n\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the Memphis Cellulose to help prevent accidental chlorine releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment,\n\n?

The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program.\n\n\n\n1.2    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nMemphis Cellulose produces purified alpha cellulose from cotton fibers (linters). The Memphis Cellulose production process is composed of three principal areas: 1) physical cleaning, which includes cotton lint receiving and unloading, lint charging, beater systems, hydropulping, refining and a slushing; 2) chemical cleaning, which includes digesting, bleaching and sour stock preparation, and 3) cellulose production, which includes preparation, drying and packaging of cellulose.  In addition, boilers provide steam to the chemical cleaning and finishing operations.  \n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause sign"

Furthermore, we coordinate our Emergency Action Plan with the community emergency response plans, including the Memphis/Shelby County LEPC and the Memphis Fire Department HAZMAT Response Team. Joint training and drills have been conducted with each of these response agencies. Our Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for:\n\n?    Notifying the Memphis/Shelby County LEPC/EMA, Memphis Fire Department, and the surrounding community of an accidental release that could have off-site consequences,\n\n?    Safely evacuating employees, contractors, and visitors,\n\n?    Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment,\n\n?    Maintaining a secure perimeter around the release area, and\n\n?    Treating individuals exposed to the release.\n\nFurther, we have implemented a series of Principally Based Operation and Maintenance Procedures (PBOMP) which provide specific and detailed actions for the prevention and control of chlorine releases at the facility.\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMemphis Cellulose has made several process safety improvements since the last revision.
