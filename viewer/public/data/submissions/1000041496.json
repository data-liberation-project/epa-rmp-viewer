A culture is established where employees feel comfortable engaging with Management to address safety concerns or improvements to a process.   \r\n\r\nLPS\r\nThe Loss Prevention System (LPS) is a proven behavior-based system designed to help prevent and resolve unplanned losses - whether safety or business-related - across the Refinery. Consistent usage of LPS tools and techniques strengthens our culture of injury and incident free operations. LPS offers a new approach to reducing and eliminating costly losses and incidents by focusing on behavior-based tools and management techniques. By using LPS, employees and contractors are able to identify the risks or potential causes of an injury or incident before it occurs and then implement the proper changes or improvements so that the task can be performed safely and efficiently. The reporting process for loss investigations, near loss investigations and observations is done through a database.\r\nSafety Audits\r\nPeriodically the Refinery is subject to company internal audits.  These audits include Fire Loss Prevention surveys, Corporate OE Safety, Fire, Health, and Reliability Reviews and Process Safety Management Audit.  These audits/surveys insure that the facility is in compliance with recommended practices, policies, and government laws and regulations. Internal audits are performed on a regular frequency involving management and first line supervision with specific emphasis on high risk safe work practices such as confined space, hot work, work at heights, electrical and isolation of hazardous energy. \r\n\r\nWe were also audited by OSHA under the Federal PSM National Enforcement Program in January 2009.

Heavier hydrocarbon compounds are further processed by cracking and subsequent combining or rearranging.  Many of the refining processes include the formation, combining, or rearranging of regulated flammable substances. Regulated flammable substances are present at the Refinery as flammable mixtures. Primary components of the mixtures are propane, butane, pentane and propylene. Secondary components of the mixtures can include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, butene, isobutane, isobutene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans, 1,3-butadiene, 2-pentene (E) 2-pentene(Z) and isopentane. \r\n\r\nThe only RMP regulated toxic substance that the refinery has above threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia. Nitrogen compounds contained in crude feeds are converted to anhydrous ammonia in the crude refining process and the anhydrous ammonia is then recovered and sold as a product. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThis section is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chevron Pascagoula Refinery.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe primary technique used to perform these evaluations is known as Process Hazards Analysis.  A PHA study is a systematic review of existing or proposed new equipment Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) or significant modifications to existing P&IDs for possible deviations from the normal design intent.\r\n\r\nThe employer must use one or more of the following PHA methods, as appropriate, to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\r\n-What if\r\n-What If/Checklist\r\n-Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP)\r\n-Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)\r\n-Fault tree analysis or\r\n-An appropriate equivalent methodology.\r\n\r\nA PHA is conducted by a team of people with expertise in engineering and process operations.

A final list of action items is reviewed with the Refinery Management Team and after concurrence, is distributed for follow-up.  This action item list is tracked to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner.  Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed in the PHA study manual.

Training programs, which are developed locally and through Chevron corporate organizations, include formal on-boarding, job-specific training, compliance training, professional skills training, and leadership development.  Learning & Development maintains detailed records of all completed training through the Chevron Learning Management System and locally managed training records.\r\n\r\nOf note are the comprehensive operations and mechanic training programs that are provided to the O&M workforce.  These programs encompass multi-year progression paths over which time the new hire trainee ultimately achieves fully qualified status as an operator or mechanic.  These programs employ a building-block approach to learning in order to ensure the Refinery is provided with a well qualified workforce.  In this culture, the individuals' learning does not end with the successful conclusion of the fully-qualified program but continues throughout their career with ongoing skill enhancement training and periodic refresher training.

We also discuss the three elements of a good shutdown: safety, quality, and schedule. Emphasis is placed on Safety first and schedule last. At times Contractors may also present their own safety presentations at this meeting. \r\n\r\nThe Refinery also has a Contractor Safety Team which consists of various contractors partnering with each other and Chevron to develop an incident and injury free culture through performing weekly field audits/observations and promoting new safety initiatives and programs.  \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation mandates that a pre-startup safety review must be conducted on new facilities and modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is to insure that prior to startup, refinery equipment is reviewed to determine whether it is safe to operate, and meets all applicable requirements of Company standards, good engineering practices, industry codes and practices, and local, State, and Federal codes and statutes.  The  PSSR  consists of several independent reviews which include a Design, Construction and Standard Review, Safety in Design Review, Plant Protection Review, an Environmental review, an Operational Readiness Review, and a Process Hazard Analysis (for new construction). \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity  \r\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment in order to prevent or minimize incidents for the life of the equipment.  The Refinery has several written programs in place that detail well-established practices and procedures for the inspection, testing, monitoring, and maintenance of process equipment, tankage"

The Refinery also has a Rotating Equipment Reliability (RER) team that is responsible for identifying machinery-related problems and promoting solutions concerning critical machinery.  Members of the RER department are consulted whenever buying new machinery or when a machine design change is being considered.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity programs are outlined in the Owner-User Manual and RI-503 and are audited by the State Jurisdiction on a three year frequency.\r\n \r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nThe Chevron Refinery has safe work practices in place to identify, assess and eliminate or mitigate risks associated with high risk work to ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include but are not limited to: \r\n1) the control of the entry, presence, and exit of personnel into confined spaces or other hazardous     work areas, \r\n2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of hazardous energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, \r\n3) procedures for the safe removal of substances that may be hazardous before equipment is opened for inspection and/or maintenance, \r\n4) a permit procedure to control activities that may be a source of ignition (i.e. hot work), and \r\n5) the controlled entry of personnel into plant areas.  \r\n\r\nThe Refinery safe work practices along with training of personnel involved with these types of work form a system that aids in making sure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\nThe purpose of MOC is 1) to anticipate incidents that could be created by a change, as well as health and safety issues, and 2) to design the change in a way that reduces the likelihood of incidents.  Management of Change applies to all changes to Refinery equipment, processes, feeds, chemicals, procedures or technology.  \r\n\r\nThe MOC process involves a"

The change passes through several phases of review with an emphasis placed on the type of change and the impact of that change.  The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an authorization to implement change approval.  A copy of the signed MOC documentation form accompanies all copies of the work request for Operator and Mechanic review.  Completed MOC documentation is retained for a minimum of five years.  Training about the change is provided to affected personnel.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation mandates that an incident investigation must be conducted for every incident that resulted in or could have resulted in a release or fire in the workplace. Since we are committed to preventing incidents and thereby protecting employees and our surrounding community we actually investigate more incidents than are required under the OSHA PSM law. We do this in an effort to understand and stop smaller problems from becoming larger problems which might lead to an incident. \r\n\r\nAll major incidents are investigated using an industry accepted process such as TapRooT&reg; or Why Tree.  This investigation process helps identify the primary root cause(s) and may include interviewing involved personnel, as well as reviewing process and equipment data, applicable procedures, operating conditions and training records. The intent of an investigation is to learn why the incident happened and prevent a recurrence of it or similar incidents. Incidents and recommendations are tracked to completion in the LPS database.\r\n \r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe Refinery Process Safety Management program is audited periodically to ensure that procedures and practices required by the accident prevention pro"

The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are kept on file in the Process Safety Management Team Lead office.\r\n \r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nRefinery processes have hazards associated with them that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The Process Safety Management program that has been discussed in this document applies to all processes at the Refinery.  The program activities as a whole reduce the likelihood of accident scenarios that could be due to equipment failure and/or human error.\r\n\r\nThe Refinery also has safety features within the process units that are designed to quickly detect, contain, control, and reduce the consequences of the release.

Details for this November 2013 fire are in Section 6 as required. This fire is an RMP incident due to the onsite fatality, large fire damage to the physical plant equipment.  However there were no offsite impacts that would make this plant ineligible to remain a Process 1 Plant. The status of any corrective actions from this investigation will be tracked in the Refinery's incident database on the Refinery intranet and through monthly metrics reviews. With respect to this accident (11/15/2013 release) CUSA provides the following clarifications: CUSA's investigation is not yet complete so it cannot identify contributing factors (6.12) and changes introduced as a result of the accident (6.13)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n \r\nThe Refinery maintains a written emergency response plan that describes procedures to protect worker safety and the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is released accidentally.  The plan includes procedures and information on all aspects of emergency response, including the incident command system (which is the organizational structure used during emergency response), fire fighting equipment and procedures, internal and external assistance and equipment resources, first aid and medical attention procedures, evacuation plans, and notification procedures for government agencies and community officials in the event of an offsite or reportable release.
