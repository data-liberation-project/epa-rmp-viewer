      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nHarbach, Nixon & Willson, Inc.\n1. The Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of H.N.W.. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with that material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n2. Facility Information: A primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia to be used in the conversion process of mixed liquid fetilizers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used in mixed liquid fertilizers. The maximum quantity stored would be 56,000 pounds in the facilitys 2 tanks. The capacities of these tanks are 28,000 pounds and 28,000 pounds.\n\n\n3. The worst- case release scenario would be a release of the total contents of the largest trailer released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest trailer at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .70 miles.\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be a release from a rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, withl 11,908 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is.60 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 191 0.1 II regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5."

      "SummaryText": "The Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries,evacuations, sheltering in place, property, or environmental damage\n\n-\n6. The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to- know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA. Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning commiftee for the coordination in the community response planning.\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
