Anthony Vineyards' safety and environmental policies are administered by the Operations Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/CalARP/RMP Program.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Anthony Vineyards facility is located at 5512 Valpredo Ave, Bakersfield, California. The facility is approximately 2.4 miles east of Highway 99. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural respect to the surrounding area with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\r\n \r\nThe facility utilizes a refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for cold storage of grapes. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 44,821 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the cold storage of grapes, and fruits. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 30 psig on the low-pressure side of the system to 150 psig on the high side. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Anthony Vineyards ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The facility co"

The facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the California Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that vent to the diffusion tank.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe CalARP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\r\n\r\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\"\r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\r\n\u00bf\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\r\n\r\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the PHA meeting on June 2, 2017, there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material to date. \r\nAnthony Vineyards has had one minor accident within the past 5 years. The accident was less than 100 pounds released, where the National Response Center (NRC) was not required to be notified. The date of the incident occurred on April 8, 2017 where one of the refrigeration contractors (welder) ran into the oil cooler and released ammonia.

Recommendations were made, closed out, and documented within 7 days after the incident investigation report was initiated.\r\n\r\nThe team used past experience and knowledge of other accidents at other facilities as examples of potential accidents that could occur at this facility.  In addition, accidents that have occurred at similar facilities were discussed during the HAZOP in order to draw a greater understanding of the risks involved with the use of ammonia and to recommend proven mitigation measures where appropriate. These events are identified in the Log Tables under the Recommendations / Comments column as INDUSTRY HISTORY.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Anthony Vineyards facility has an emergency response plan in effect. The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP/CalARP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.

The Anthony Vineyards safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\r\n \r\nIn 2018, with the assistance of a refrigeration contractor, Anthony Vineyards completed modifications to the existing ammonia refrigeration system.  These modifications included the addition of four Pre-Cooling Rooms, one Compressor, and one Evaporative Condenser.  The ammonia charge was also increased to 29,821 pounds.  As part of this project, a Process Hazard Analysis of the new equipment was completed on May 22, 2018.  In addition, a Seismic Assessment of the new equipment was completed.\r\n\r\nIn late 2018/early 2019, Anthony Vineyards further modified the existing ammonia refrigeration system with the addition of four (4) Storage Room Accumulators with Evaporator Coils, as well as two (2) Evaporators.  With the addition of the new equipment, the ammonia charge was also increased to 44,821 pounds.  As part of the Management of Change procedure, a Process Hazard Analysis of the new equipment was completed on December 9, 2019."
