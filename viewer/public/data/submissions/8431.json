Figure 1 is a map that shows the circle defined by the \n0.65-mile downwind distance.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario \n\nDarigold conducted a safety review to assess a range of accidents that could cause \nammonia releases large enough to affect people beyond the facility boundary.  The \nreview team selected the following hypothetical accident as the Alternate Release \nScenario.  Note that this scenario incorporates the ammonia gas detectors and \nautomatic shutoff systems described in the \u0013Plant Upgrades to Improve Safety\u0014 section \nof this Executive Summary.\n\nA flexible hose on one of the 12 plates on the plate freezer suddenly breaks, causing all \nof the ammonia inside the plate to spill onto the floor of the freezer room.  In reality, a \nworn hose would probably develop a slow pinhole leak that would be easily detected and \nrepaired before the hose broke.  However, to be conservative, it is assumed that the \nhose breaks instantaneously, before the electronic gas detector inside the freezer room \ncan automatically shut off the system and alert the operators before the break occurs. \nUnder this conservative scenario, 241 pounds of liquid ammonia spills onto the floor of \nthe freezer room and begins to evaporate.  The thermodynamic properties of ammonia \ndictate that 18 percent (i.e., 43 pounds) of the spilled liquid immediately \u0013flashes\u0014 to \nvapor.  The remainder of the spilled liquid immediately cools to ammonia\u0012s boiling point \ntemperature (-28 degrees F), forms a puddle of liquid ammonia, and slowly evaporates.   \n\nThe gas detector inside the freezer room automatically shuts off the freezer pumps and \ncloses the room\u0012s louvers to prevent the release from spreading to other parts of the \nbuilding.  The room\u0012s ventilation fan then discharges the evaporating ammonia to the \nrooftop emergency vent.  It is assumed that Darigold\u0012s HazMat team arrives at the \nscene 10 mi"

The Seattle plant produces ice cream, milk, milk \nproducts, and juice for distribution throughout the Puget Sound region.  \n\nPlant operations include bulk milk receiving and storage, milk processing, ice cream \nmanufacture, packaging, warehousing, and shipping.  \n\nThe plant uses a mechanical ammonia refrigeration system to chill the product during \nprocessing and cool the cold storage warehouse that is used to store the product before \nshipment.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia at various locations \nthroughout the plant.  At any given time, 27,000 pounds of ammonia is typically stored \nand used at the facility.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\nDuring the past 5 years, Darigold\u0012s Rainier Avenue Plant has not experienced any \nammonia releases that resulted in any injuries, offsite evacuations, or property damage.\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nDarigold\u0012s Rainier Avenue Plant is subject to OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management \n(PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with the ammonia \nrefrigeration system.  In response to safety reviews performed as part of EPA\u0012s ARPP, \nDarigold\u0012s safety management system is being upgraded to include the following PSM \nelements to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n\nx Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the ammonia system to \nassess their proper design and installation.\n \nx Review of standard operating procedures for the ammonia system.
