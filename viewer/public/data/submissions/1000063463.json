(\"Plains\") is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations. Plains' management goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Tampa Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by Plains. At the facility, we receive propane via vessels/ships. The received propane is stored in a large refrigerated atmospheric tank. From this tank, propane can be loaded directly into tanker trucks for distribution or loaded onto barge or ship. Propane and ethyl mercaptan are the only flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Tampa Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. There are no toxic substances present at the site. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Plains. These high standards include:\r\n\u00bf\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating a"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency shutdown devices at locations throughout the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.\r\n\u00bf\tMinimizing the possibility of overfilling by having high and high high level alarms on all propane storage tanks.\r\n\u00bf\tProviding a facility-wide fire water system at the facility, which is designed to cool the tanks in the event of a fire.\r\n\u00bf\tA hydrocarbon gas detection system consisting of numerous gas detectors located throughout the facility. The hydrocarbon gas detection system will sound an alarm at low gas concentrations and will trigger emergency shutdown system at high gas concentrations (in parts of the facility).\r\n\u00bf\tA fire detection system consisting of several UV/IR fire-eyes, which will trigger emergency shutdown system when activated.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nWithin the last five years, there have been no chemical release accidents that resulted in onsite injuries, death, or property damage or offsite impacts.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Tampa Termina"
