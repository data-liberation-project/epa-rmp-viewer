      "SummaryText": "Abbott Laboratories operates a pharmaceutical manufacturing complex in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico.  The Abbott facility is divided into four manufacturing plants in addition to support operations, including the waste water treatment plant (WWTP), utilities and the cogeneration facility.   In the course of producing these pharmaceuticals, Abbott uses one of the compounds which appear on the list of Risk Management Planning chemicals and which is stored in greater-than-threshold quantities.  Specifically, at the wastewater treatment plant chlorine is injected into the waste water to disinfect treated water; used a the absorbing media in the air pollution control equipment (i.e., scrubbers); and for the WWTP tertiary water system.  The chlorine system at the WWTP includes a total of five 1 ton cylinders and an injection system.\n\n    Abbott has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in process safety and accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes.  Abbott's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals.   In addition, Abbott has established strong programs in its operation which have led and will continue to lead to reductions in the use of hazardous chemicals.  For example, Abbott has instituted a basic operating procedure (BOP) to ensure that on-site quantities of another chemical (i.e., monomethylamine) that appears on the RMP list of regulated substances, remains below the threshold quantity.  The storage of chemicals in less-than-threshold quantities results in a safer process and ensures that public and offsite consequences will be minimized.  Another example is the Management of Change program implemented by Abbott.  Under this BOP established by Abbott,  all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures must be "

Numerous other programs have also been established and are documented in Abbott's prevention program.\n\n    Abbott currently operates a number of safety systems at the WWTP to mitigate any release of chlorine.  Specifically, the chlorine storage area is equipped with an interlock system that will activate an extractor and alarms in the event of high chlorine concentrations in the storage area, and the chlorine transfer line is equipped with vacuum regulators that will shut down the chlorine supply if the vacuum line is broken.  Abbott is currently evaluating a proposed change to the ventilation system in the chlorine storage area.  This proposed improvement consists of replacing the existing exhaust duct and grill with a new FRP slot type grill six inches from the floor level.  Abbott is currently evaluating a proposed improvement to the ventilation system in the chlorine storage area.  This proposed improvement consists of replacing the existing exhaust duct and grill with a new fiber reinforced plastic slot type grill six inches above the floor level.  In addition, Abbott has recently completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) on the chlorine system and will be implementing a number of changes to the chlorine system that were identified during the PHA.  \n\n    In accordance with the Risk Management Plan regulations promulgated at 40 CFR Part 68, the chlorine process at the WWTP must be treated as a Program 3 process.  Therefore, a hazard analysis, a prevention program, and a emergency response program have been developed to address the  use of chlorine at the WWTP.  Each of these RMP elements are addressed below:\n\n    Hazard Analysis - The worst-case release scenario has been defined as a fully loaded chlorine cylinder being dropped during loading and rupturing.  Therefore, a single one-ton chlorine storage vessel has been selected for the worst-case release scenario.  Estimation of the distance to the toxic endpoint was performed u"

Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud of chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  However, no environmental receptors would be impacted.  \n\n    The alternative release scenario that has been selected is the same as the worst-case release scenario (i.e., rupture of 1-ton chlorine cylinder), but occurring under meteorological conditions that are more favorable to dispersion.   Estimation of the distance to the toxic endpoint is performed using the USEPA guidance computer program RMPComp (Version 1.06).  Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud of chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  However, no environmental receptors would be impacted.  \n\n    No accidental releases of chlorine from the WWTP have occurred in the last five years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or known off-site death, injuries, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n    Prevention Program - Because the WWTP is a Program 3 covered process, Abbott is required to comply with the Program 3 Prevention Program requirements in Subpart D of the Part 68 regulations.  As documented below, Abbott has fully complied with each requirement.\n\n    Process Safety Information - Abbott has written process safety information on the hazards of chlorine, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.\n\n    Process Hazard Analysis - Abbott has written procedures that document a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the WWTP are identified and controlled.  In addition,  following these procedures, Abbott has recently conducted a process hazard analysis of the chorine system at the WWTP.\n\n    Operating Procedures  - Abbott has developed written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely operating the chlorination system at the wastewater treatment plant.

Abbott has also developed and implemented safe work practices for lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening of process equipment; and entrance into the facility.\n\n    Training - Abbott has provided initial training for all current employees and is committed to providing training to each new employee who will be directly involved in the operation of the WWTP chlorine injection process. Abbott has also documented that each employee involved in the operation of the WWTP chlorine injection process has received and understands the subject training. \n\n    Mechanical Integrity Program - Abbott has established and implemented written procedures for maintaining the mechanical integrity of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps, and has trained each employee involved in the maintaining the on-going integrity of the equipment in an overview of the process and its hazards.  \n\n    Management of Change - Abbott has established written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  \n\n    Pre-Startup Safety Review - Abbott is committed to performing a pre-start-up safety review for new sources and modified sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.    Reinforcing this commitment are the procedures that Abbott has in place to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for start-up prior to placing any new or modified equipment into service.\n\n    Compliance Audits - Abbott has developed procedures to conduct a compliance audit and to resolve any deficiencies identified in the compliance audit.

Abbott has procedures in place that document Abbott's approach to investigating each incident and documenting and resolving all incident report findings. \n\n    Employee Participation - Abbott has written procedures that addresses how Abbott will consult with all employees and their representatives regarding the conduct and development of process hazards analysis and other elements of process safety management.\n\n    Hot Work Permits - Abbott has written procedures in place that address the requirement to issue permits for hot work conducted on or near a covered process.  \n \n    Contractor Procedures - Abbott has procedures in place that document the procedures that Abbott will follow in hiring contractors to work in or adjacent to the chlorination system at the WWTP.
