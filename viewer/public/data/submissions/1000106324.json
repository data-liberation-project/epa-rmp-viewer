The facility utilizes 24.5% aqueous ammonia solution for manufacturing various nitrogenous fertilizers. \r\n\r\n24.5% aqueous ammonia solution is stored within two (2) 15,000 gallon double wall steel tanks. As required, 24.5% aqueous ammonia is pumped through fused polyethylene pipes into Mixer 5 and Mixer 6 where it is blended with other products to generate the desired fertilizer blend.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process at Mar Vista Resources consists of tanks, mixers, pumps, and valves which are interconnected by piping.\r\n \r\nThe process is not subject to California or Federal OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation because the solution concentrations is less than the concentrations listed in the PSM regulation:\r\n\r\nThe 24.5% aqueous ammonia solution process exceeds the USEPA Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity (20,000 lbs for ammonia solutions >20%). In the USEPA RMP Regulation, Table 1 to \u00a768.130 lists two different thresholds for ammonia: (1) Ammonia (anhydrous) over 10,000 lbs. and (2) Ammonia (concentration 20% or greater) over 20,000 lbs. Due to this distinction, when determining applicability for the USEPA RMP, the aqueous ammonia solution is calculated based on the total weight of the aqueous ammonia solution, rather than extracting the weight of the ammonia from the aqueous ammonia solution.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the mass of ammonia within the solution exceeds the threshold quantity for the CalARP regulation (500 lbs).\r\n\r\nRAGAGEP Statement\r\nIt is unknown which codes and standards were followed in the design and construction of the 24.5% aqueous ammonia solution process at Mar Vista Resources.
