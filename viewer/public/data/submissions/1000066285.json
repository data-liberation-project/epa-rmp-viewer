The F4 and F6 units produce pure ethylene oxide (EO). However, the F-8 unit dissolves the EO in water prior to sending the aqueous EO to the G units for processing.  The G units react ethylene oxide and water to produce ethylene glycol. G-1 unit receives the cycle water bleed streams produced in the F units and recovers antifreeze-grade glycol. The flammable mixture noted below includes inventories of non-RMP flammable chemicals and RMP flammable chemicals. All the risk management program elements apply. The units contain trenches and process area detectors.\n\nThe F8 unit is not online at the time of this submittal, it is currently in the commissioning phase with an anticipated online date of April 2016.\n\n",

              "Description": "The F-5, PO/MTBE process area consists of seven sections which are the Feed Preparation, the Peroxidation Reaction, the Epoxidation Reaction, the TBA Purification, the PO Purification, Formate Destruction and the MTBE sections. The Feed Preparation Section consists of purification towers to purify and concentrate isobutane prior to charging the Peroxidation Section for an oxidation reaction.   The Epoxidation Section manufactures propylene oxide.  The Tertiary Butyl Alcohol (TBS) section reclaims and purifies tertiary butyl alcohol for reuse; the Propylene Oxide Section does the same for propylene oxide.  The Formate Destruction section converts the formates generated in the F5 Process prior to sending the feed material to the MTBE section.  The MTBE section manufactures and purifies MTBE. The risk management program elements apply to the F5 unit. The flammable mixture noted below includes inventories of non-RMP flammable chemicals and RMP flammable chemicals. This process unit has associated diked storage tanks.",

Chlorine is located at ten (10) separate locations.\n\nThe Utility Process Area also utilizes cyclohexylamine at 50% concentration as a water treatment chemical for the boiler feed water system. This material is located in 3 different bulk tanks on site. \n\nCurrently this new material is in one location and under the Threshold Quantity, we anticipated changing the bulk tank volumes and utilizing this material throughout the site in 2016 at which point, the onsite amount, would exceed the threshold quantity.\n\n",

The Site utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Site assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Huntsman does have a Hurricane Procedure and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane and inclement weather.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nHuntsman PNO maintains written operating procedures that are developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nHuntsman PNO provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.

The PNO Site has had one (1) reportable RMP incident in the last five years.  The incident involved a release of ethylene oxide that resulted in a Huntsman employee injury. There was no onsite property damage. There were no off-site impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  Huntsman has a written emergency response program that contains procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a regulated substance.  These procedures include steps for informing the public, proper first aid and medical treatment, the proper use of emergency equipment and emergency response training for emergency response employees who perform emergency response duties and to local emergency responders who may be called to assist in emergency response.   The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  Huntsman is actively involved with informing local stakeholders about hazardous substances stored and processed on site.  Huntsman participates with the Jefferson County LEPC, Sabine Neches Chiefs"

There are several planned improvements at the PNO Site to reduce the on and offsite impacts of hazardous processes.  Selected ongoing projects include improvements to install and in some cases upgrade the Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) as well as upgrade the process control and instrumentation equipment in many of the units.  There is continual commitment to implement changes, when identified, that will improve the safety of employees and neighbors of the PNO Site as well as projects that enhance safety, environmental protection and protect neighbors from exposure to accidental releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.  Reason for 2017 Re-submittal is due to adding a new waste water treatment chemical to the site that has an RMP listed chemical as a component.  The storage volume of the treatment material and the % of the RPM component will put the facility over the threshold quantity for this new chemical and thus the need for a re-submittal."
