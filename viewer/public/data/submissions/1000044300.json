The primary purpose of this facility is to process these meats into food products for distribution to retailers.  A product distribution center located next to the plant is included with this RMP.  The maintenance and refrigeration processes at the distribution center are managed by the plant. A contracted firm manages the distribution center and non-plant employees that are used to move product. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\nIndependent ammonia refrigeration processes exist at the plant and distribution center.  Ammonia is contained in a closed loop systems; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since the purchase of the facility in 1995. The facility was designed and constructed and maintained in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.  The facility was expanded and updated (1996) which included replacing the high pressure ammonia receiver with a new tank and associated piping system.  Furthermore, additions to the process have occur"

This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. Company machinery room policy, respiratory policy, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nThe Manager of Plant Engineering is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.

The purpose of compiling written process safety information is to enable the employees involved in operating the ammonia refrigeration system to identify and understand the system and features of all its components and the hazards posed by the system.  \n\n? Process Hazard Analysis: \n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) re-validation was conducted in 2015 for the plant and  distribution center.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed What-if factors such as:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\n? Operating Procedures: \n\nWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\n? Training Program: \n\nAll ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a formal training program. This program consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and comprehensive employee initial and refresher training to insure equipment integrity. \n\n\n\nThe overall purpose of training personnel is to enable them to safely and efficiently operate and maintain the ammonia refrigeration system and increase employee awareness of potential hazards.\n\n&#8195;\n\n\n\n?

The purpose of a mechanical integrity program is to maintain ammonia refrigeration equipment so that a catastrophic release of ammonia is avoided.\n\n? Hot Work Permit Procedures: \n\nThe plant has implemented a Hot Work permit program including training.  \n\n? Management of Change Procedures: \n\nFor projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\n?
