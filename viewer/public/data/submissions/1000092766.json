Incoming gas enters through a pig receiver and flows to the respective rick or lean slug catchers. The lean slug catcher allows for separation and holding of incoming produced water. Produced water from the lean slug catcher is sent to the slop tank for storage. Next, the gas flows to the lean system dehydration equipment and finally an existing pig launcher. The rich slug catcher provided separation and volume holding for incoming natural gas liquids. Liquids from the rich slug catcher and rich filter coalescer is sent to an onsite NGL tank for storage and truck loadout. Overhead flash gas from the NGL storage tank is routed to a flash gas compressor and sent back into the process gas piping upstream. The facility has been designed in a manner that will minimize the potential for accidental releases from regulated substances.\n\n",

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is XCL Midstream's policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations. The Wells Hill Interconnect facility has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is XCL Midstream's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Also, XCL Midstream has coordinated response activities with the Marshall County EMA and local Fire and Rescue Departments.\n\n\n\nB. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Wells Hill Interconnect facility is a central receiving point for the XcL Midstream \"rich\" and \"lean\" gathering pipeline systems located in rural Marshall County, West Virginia, near Proctor, West Virginia. The products handled are flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nC. The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\na. Worst Case Scenario:\n\nSince the Wells Hill Interconnect facility does not have any toxic regulated substances above the threshold quantity, the worst-case scenario was only carried out for the uncontrolled release of the largest inventory of flammable mixtures, which was more than 10,000 pounds of a mixture of flammable substances that meet criteria for the NFPA-4 rating. To carry out this analysis, it was assumed that none of the protective barriers in the facility worked.\n\nEP"

For the Wells Hill Interconnect facility, it was assumed that the single pressure vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (NGL Storage Tank V-261) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. RMP*Comp, an EPA-sponsored software tool, was used to calculate the distances to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint. As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on a release of propane, a component of the mixture in the tank. Meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined in 40 CFR\n\n?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mi/h). The scenario involved a catastrophic release of the total quantity of the flammable substance assumed to form a vapor cloud, which detonates. Ten percent (10%) of the material in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion, 13,111 lbs.\n\n\n\nb. Alternative Case scenarios:\n\nAn alternative case scenario considered a release from the NGL Storage Tank V-261 resulting in a vapor cloud fire. Methane was selected as the predominant regulated component of the mixture, as it resulted in a greater distance to the lower flammable limit (LFL) endpoint. RMP*Comp, was used to predict a distance of 0.3 miles to the LFL endpoint, with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77?F). The scenario involved a release of 5,010 lbs/min which continues until the NGL Storage Tank is empty.\n\n\n\nD. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA.

      "SummaryText": "History\n\nThe Wells Hill Interconnect facility has not had any accidental release as provided in 40 CFR ?68.42 that reached beyond the property line or resulted in deaths on site, injuries or significant property damage on site, or any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage since it started operations.\n\n\n\nF. Emergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Wells Hill Interconnect facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38, 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR 68). The EAP defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance, natural disasters, and terrorist threats. The plan includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release. The EAP addresses all aspects of emergency response including notifying facility personnel, emergency response personnel, Marshall County, West Virginia EMA/EMS, as well as Volunteer Fire Departments. All employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures. The most recent review of the ERP was done on December 14, 2020. On May 12, 2009, Senate Bill 279, entitled Emergency Response Regulations, more commonly known as the Fifteen Minute Rule was signed into law. The bill amends the Code of West Virginia, Chapter 131, adding new provisions that will require RMP subject industrial facilities (among others) to provide certain information to state and local emergency responders within 15 minutes of an accident or emergency. Local emergency responders must be provided information related to public health, safety and welfare regarding hazardous waste or material releases.\n\n\n\nG.
