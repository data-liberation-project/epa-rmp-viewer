This sommittment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental relase prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated sustances.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled.  Our facility's primary activities encompass Semi-conductor grade hydrochloric acid and zinc diakyldithiophosphates.  We have three regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Hydrochloric Acid, and Furan.  Chlorine is used for making hydrochloric acic.  Hydrochloric acid is used for strictly to ship as a finished product to customers.  Furan is used for pyrrole and n-mehtyl pyrrole.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 540,000 pounds, hydrochloric acid maximum inventory is 800,000 pounds, and furan has a maximum inventory of 40,000 pounds. \n \n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Senarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Comply.  The following provides details of the chosen scenarios.  \nThe worst case release scenario submitted for program  3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of chlorine storage and handling system.  In this scenario, 180,000 pounds of chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity is 100% of a rail car.  At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic"

An estimated 160,000 people mayl be affected by this release.    \nThe worst case scenario for furan involves a release of 40,000 pounds from the storage tank of furan.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1000 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as a dike that is 238 square feet and 3.3 feet high is taken into account to calculate this scenario.  This dike has the effect of controlling the spread of the liquid.  At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 14 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0012 mg/L.  An estimated 81,000 people may be affected by this type of release.  \nThe worst case scenario for hydrochloric acid involves a release of 300,000 pounds from the storage tank of hydrochloric acid.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 694 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as a dike that is 1200 square feet and 2.5 feet high is taken into account to calculate this scenario.  This dike has the effect of controlling the spread of the liquid.  At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 4.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L.  An estimated 33,000 people may be attected by this type of release.  \nThe alternate release scenario for chlorine involves a release from chrlorine storage and handling system.  The scenario involves the release of 8,000 pounds of chlorine.  The chlorine is assumed to evaporate during one minute from a burst pipe during transfer.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown systems.  At class D atomospheric stability and wind speed of 3 m/s,  the maximum distance of 3.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.
