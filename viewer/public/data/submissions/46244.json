SANCHEZ,  WATER  OPERATIONS  MANAGER\n956-383-1618\n05/2006\n\n\nIntroduction:  The North Alamo Water Supply Corporation (NAWSC) is a legally chartered corporation operating under the laws of the State of Texas for the purpose of furnishing potable water and wastewater utility service for rural residents of eastern Hidalgo County, Willacy County and northwestern Cameron County as described in Certificates of Convenience and Necessity Nos. 10553 and 20645 (CCN). The Corporation\u00bfs CCN boundary encompasses 973 square miles and either surrounds or is adjacent to 16 cities and / or communities that operate public water systems. The system presently serves over 31,000 meter connections (representing an estimated population of 124,000), which include households, numerous businesses, 20 schools and 6 other Public water Systems from 6 surface water treatment plants and 1 reverse osmosis treatment plant. The surface water treatment plants treat surface water conveyed by 6 irrigation districts. The original source of the raw water is the Rio Grande River.\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, \u00bfChemical Accident Prevention Provisions\u00bf, requires the development of Risk Management Plans / Programs (RMP) for regulated facilities that store / handle certain substances above a listed threshold quantity. Such facilities must register with the US EPA, list their regulated substances, estimate the off-site consequences of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios, document its applicable prevention measures and coordinate its emergency responses with appropriate local / state authorities.\n\nNAWSC Plant # 1 is a regulated facility under 40 CFR Part 68, because of the presence of chlorine gas (Chemical Abstract Services [CAS] No. 7782-50-5) over a regulated threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds. It is also subject to"

The OSHA PSM requirements are reflected in the Accident Prevention Program Level 3 of the US EPA RMP.\n\nFacility Information:  The primary activity at the site is the potable treatment of raw water for sale to retail consumers and other water systems. Its overall treatment capacity is 2.0 million gallons per (MGD). The main treatment processes consist of: aeration, clarification and filtration. As part of those processes, chlorine is added as a solution in water between the aeration and clarification steps and as a gas prior to filtration. Chlorine is stored on-site in: 5 \u00bf 150 pound pressurized steel cylinders and 2 \u00bf 1 ton pressurized steel cylinders. The total amount in storage is 4,750 pounds\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:  This accidental release scenario would involve the release of the total contents as a gas of the largest storage tank (1 \u00bf ton cylinder). It would occur over a period of 10 minutes and result in the release of approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersal to 0.0087 parts per million or ppm) is estimated to be 0.9 miles. This scenario was analyzed using the US EPA \u00bf approved computer program RMP*COMP (v. 1.07).\n\nAlternate-Case Release Scenario:  This accidental release scenario would involve a more likely incident than the Worst-Case Scenario and result from a valve leak. It would result in the loss of over 9 minutes of approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas, but due to less extreme weather conditions, the distance to the endpoint is estimated to be 0.2 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with applicable codes and standards and is developing a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) as require"

That Program seeks to ensure the safe operation of regulated facilities for all aspects of construction and operation.\n\nFive Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage, nor to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act [EPCRA]).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. A PSM Program is being developed and implemented that may result in future changes to provide for a safer and more efficient work site."
