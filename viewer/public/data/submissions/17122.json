Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  We at CR Briggs  are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental\n  safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release\n  prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\n  maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\n  our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\n  substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency\n  response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n  \n  \n     2.     The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n  Our facility's primary activities encompass open pit gold mining.  We have three regu-\n  \n  lated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia, Propane\n  and Hydrochloric acid.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several\n  uses.  Ammonia is used in the Specialized Catalyst Reduction (SCR.) of oxides of\n  nitrogen.  Propane is used for heating and the firing of the dore=furnace for gold\n  recovery.  Hydrochloric acid  is used for an acid wash of carbon in the recovery of\n  gold.\n  \n  The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 59255 lb. while Propane and\n  Hydrochloric acid  are present at our facility in quantities of 27779 lb. and 15658 lb.\n  respectively.\n  \n     3.     The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\n     Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation mea-\n     \n     sures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n  To evaluate the worst cas"

The scenario involves the release\n  of 59255 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation\n  controls such as dikes, sumps and berms are also taken into account to calculate the\n  scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum\n  distance of 8.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n  \n  One alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in\n  Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n  \n  The alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from the SCR Bed\n  located at the crusher in the storage tank and transfer piping to SCR Catalyst System\n  for oxides of  nitrogen reduction.  The scenario involves the release of 59255 lb. of\n  Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes\n  and berms are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed\n  to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include water curtain(s).  Under\n  neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L\n  of Ammonia is 2.8 miles.\n  \n  The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances\n  as a class involves a catastrophic release from the propane stor"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the\n     Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release\n  prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was\n  designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  Our\n  facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  We also have\n  an air operating permit ID under Title V of the Clean Air Act.

These procedures address various\n  modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations,\n  emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a\n  turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to\n  operators involved in the processes.\n  \n  Training\n  CR Briggs  has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\n  who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\n  these processes.  Refresher training is provided yearly and more frequently as needed.\n  \n  Mechanical Integrity\n  CR Briggs  carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\n  ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes\n  among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems,\n  emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried\n  out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. \n  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

Five-year Accident History\n  CR Briggs has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5\n  years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental\n  release during this period.\n  \n     \n     6.     Emergency Response Plan\n  CR Briggs  carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases\n  of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including\n  adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency\n  response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected\n  areas.\n  \n  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly\n  inspected and serviced.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n  Continual training in Hazmat and Hazardous Waste are some of the major steps we\n  want to take to improve safety at our facility.
