Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRobinson Dairy recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property and the environment.  The RMP program will guide us in keeping the ammonia refrigeration system well maintained.  The safety and health of all personnel and the protection of the environment are very important to us.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.  \nThe Company has a Plant Safety Program.  The primary objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance.\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in preventing the accidental release of ammonia and minimizing the impact of any release, the facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program.  Emergency Response programs have been reviewed and we will continue to use our Emergency Action Plan.  The objectives of the PSM/RMP programs are to prevent accidental releases.  Good Operating Procedures and Mechanical Integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system is an important part.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nRobinson Dairy operates a milk processing facility where milk products are processed, packaged, sold and distributed from this facility.  Refrigeration is required to cool the milk during processing and to maintain the cold storage rooms at a temperature for optimum shelf life of the product.  One freezer room kept at approximately 20 degrees below zero for storing ice cream.  Ammonia refrigeration systems are considered to be the most efficient and environmentally friendly for industrial facilities.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7662-41-7) contained in the system is approximately 12,500 pounds.  The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop sy"

      "SummaryText": "stem whereby liquid ammonia from the high pressure receiver located outside the building is piped in special piping to refrigeration equipment used for cooling or freezing.  During cooling or freezing, the pressure of the ammonia is reduced so that the ammonia can take away heat from the milk products being cooled or stored.  The ammonia returns to the engine room in larger special piping in vapor form at low pressure to the high side compressors or the booster compressor where the vapors are compressed and piped to the condensers located on the roof.  Forced air and recirculated water cool and condense the vapors.\nAmmonia is a non-corrosive chemical to steel; therefore, does not deteriorate the inside of vessels, lines or valves.  It also carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  All vessels containing ammonia are ASME pressure rated significantly above the maximum operating pressure.\n\nC.  Summary of Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario at the facility involves the release of 12,515 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period which would result in a pump-down situation when all the ammonia would be pumped back to the High Pressure Receiver and backed up into the Condensers.  This is nearly the entire amount of the ammonia in the refrigeration system.  Under the scenario, the pressure vessel is assumed to rupture and release the entire quantity over a 10 minute period of time coupled with the wind speed and quality to be the worst possible.  Under this very unlikely Worst-Case scenario, the ammonia vapors could travel in a 1.5 miles radius before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nTwo alternative or more likely release scenario's at the facility were evaluated.  The first alternate scenario would be a release of ammonia vapors through a safety relief valve on a surge drum of one of the milk silos.  This release could release 26 pounds of ammonia per minute and we estimate the release could occ"

The second alternate scenario would be a release of liquid ammonia from a pitted liquid pipe consisting of a hole 1/8th inch diameter.  This scenario would release 86 pounds of ammonia per minute at 130 psig.  We would expect to discover this type of leak within 10 minutes.  Under either of the alternative scenarios, the ammonia vapors would travel only 0.1 miles before no longer posing a hazard to the public.\n\nD.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\na.  Employee Participation:  Maintenance employees participated in the Process Hazard Analyses and other parts of the Program.\nb.   Process Safety Information:  Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) have been developed where all parts of the system are drawn and identified on AutoCAD drawings.  Information has been obtained including Manufacturer's Data Sheets and Certified drawings for the vessels.  Process Safety Information also includes information on the toxicity of the anhydrous ammonia.\nc.  Process Hazard Analysis:  Studies were conducted using a What-if/Checklist technique to study the system and identify potential hazards that could result in a catasthropic event.  The study basically includes studying all parts of the refrigeration system and asking ourselves questions about each part e.g., What does it do? How does it work? How can it fail?  What could cause it to fail?  and how can we prevent it from failing?  A schedule is made including the severity and liklihood of each hazards identified with a timetable to address the hazard.\nd.  Operating Procedures:  Written procedures have been developed which describe the steps to be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\ne.  Training:  A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on the system and the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\nf.

Pre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review will be completed for all new ammonia projects involving a change to the system to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, operating procedures developed, P&IDs developed, PHA completed, and construction has been completed according to the design specifications.\nh.  Mechanical Integrity:  Annual inspections of the ammonia refrigeration system and Independent inspections every five years.\ni.  Hot Work:  Procedures to be followed to ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning in any area other than area(s) designated as hot work.\nj.  Management of Change:  The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed prior to the change.\nk.  Incident Investigation:  The procedures are designed to ensure that all incidents involving the ammonia refrigeration system are quickly and thoroughly investigated.  Incident investigations are to be begun within 48 hours of any incident.\nl.  Compliance Audits:  Audits will be conducted every three years to ascertain if there are any shortcomings are promptly addressed.\n\nE.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo ammonia-related incidents were identified for the facility in the previous five years.\n\nF.  Description of the Emergency Action Plan\n\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at the facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Denver Fire Department through plant visits our Hazardous Materials Inventory Statement."
