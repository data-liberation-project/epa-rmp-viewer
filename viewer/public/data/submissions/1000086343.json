The Terminal is using the Guaynabo Puma dock facilities to receive and ship product. Puma is required to comply with United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 because the facility stores propane and butane on-site in quantities exceeding the rule threshold quantity for these substances.  The following executive summary is provided in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPuma is committed to operating and maintaining its butane and propane operations (generically referred to as liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) in a safe and responsible manner.  Puma has developed and implemented accidental release prevention and emergency response provisions at the facility, including those required under the USEPA RMP rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The facility is also subject to other emergency plan regulations such as those under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, state Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (ECPRA), and United States Coast Guard (USCG) rules.\n\n\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nPuma operates a petroleum product terminal located in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, which handles butane and propane, which are regulated flammable substances under RMP regulations.  Puma's butane and propane terminal loading activities consist of:\n\nButane transfer from barges to pressurized bullet tanks or"

The total storage capacity of the bullets is 20,000 BBLS.\n\nThe LPG Facility has the capacity of trucks being loaded from the bullet tanks or sphere at a rate of 200 to 2,271.74 liters per minute.\n\nThe butane bullets facilities consist of 15 bullet tanks, and one Sphere, located at south area of the plant. Also, the 10 bullet tanks located at north area of the plant facilities can be used for butane storage. The total storage capacity of the bullets is 36,899 BBLS. \n\nEach bullet is connected to the dock's 10-inch pipeline for filling purpose and connected to butane pumps' 10-inch suction header. The sphere is connected also to the dock's 10-inch pipeline for filling purpose and connected to butane bullets filling pipeline for filling the butane bullets purpose. \n\nButane is transferred from the bullets to the truck loading terminal and, eventually, to tank trucks for distribution to customers.\n\nButane and propane transfer rate from barges to bullet tanks or sphere is 1,000 gal/min.\n\nPropane transfer rate from bullet to ship is 2,100 gal/min.\n\n\n\nPhase 2A:\n\nThe storage capacity for Phase 2A consisted of eight (8) bullets tanks located at the Southwest of the plant. The total storage capacity of phase 2A tanks is 16,000 bbls. The pipelines connected the Phase 2A storage tanks to the facilities such as dock and truck loading terminal. \n\n\n\n"

The total storage capacity of phases 2C and 2D tanks is 36,000 bbls. The added pipelines will connect the new storage tanks to the existing facilities such as dock and truck loading terminal. \n\n \n\nPhase 2B Area: \n\nThe storage capacity for Phase 2B consisted of seven (7) bullets tanks located at the North and Northwest of the plant. The total storage capacity of phase 2B tanks is 12,000 bbls. The pipelines connected the Phase 2B storage tanks to facilities such as dock and truck loading terminal.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility's general accident prevention program consists of compliance with USEPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM regulations. Key elements include the following:\n\nProcess Safety Information - Information regarding butane and propane hazards, process technology, and process equipment is complied, updated, and made available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - Analyses are conducted every five years with the objective of identifying, evaluating, and controlling the process hazards, and findings and recommendations are promptly addressed.\n\nOperating Procedures - Procedures are developed and maintained up to date to provide instructions for safe operations of process equipment during various phases of operation.\n\nTraining - Initial and recurring training is provided to all employees involved in operating a regulated process.\n\nMechanical Integrity - Procedures are developed and implemented to maintain the on-going integrity of vessels, process piping, transfer hoses, and other process equipment. These include procedures for maintenance, training of maintenance employees, and inspection and testing.\n\nManagement of Change - Written procedures are used to manage changes to process-related chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures, and other chang"
