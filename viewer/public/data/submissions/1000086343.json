The Terminal is using the Guaynabo Puma dock facilities to receive and ship product. Puma is required to comply with United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 because the facility stores propane and butane on-site in quantities exceeding the rule threshold quantity for these substances.  The following executive summary is provided in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nPuma is committed to operating and maintaining its butane and propane operations (generically referred to as liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) in a safe and responsible manner.  Puma has developed and implemented accidental release prevention and emergency response provisions at the facility, including those required under the USEPA RMP rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The facility is also subject to other emergency plan regulations such as those under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, state Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (ECPRA), and United States Coast Guard (USCG) rules.\r\n\r\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances\r\nPuma operates a petroleum product terminal located in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, which handles butane and propane, which are regulated flammable substances under RMP regulations.  Puma's butane and propane terminal loading activities consist of:\r\nButane transfer from barges to pressurized bullet tanks or"

The facility will inform to federal and state emergency response agencies about accidental releases, review and update the emergency response plan as appropriate and ensure that employees are informed of the changes to the emergency response plan. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety\r\nPUMA continually strives to improve process safety. The facility's butane and propane processes are built and designed in accordance with recognized safety industry standards and/or government requirements. PUMA expects that on-going programs such as process hazard analyses, compliance audits, and incident investigations will result in continual improvements to process safety."
