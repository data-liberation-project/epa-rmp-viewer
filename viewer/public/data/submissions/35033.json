Box 278, Dodge, NE 68633               \n            \n\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of\nany accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the event an\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), \nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on\nthe specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people\nand the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"Establishments primarily engaged in\noperating country or terminal grain elevators\", however we are also engaged in providing\n\"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of anhydrous ammonia for\ndelivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and\nreloading anhydrous ammonia is # 493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  We include all crop protection and petroleum products in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the\nanhydrous ammonia facilities will be included in this report.    \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during\nthe early spring months.   Anhydrous ammonia may also be applied in the fall during some years.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The Boone county LEPC and the local response agencies have been informed of the minimum qualities that may be on the site at any given time. \n  \n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and\nreloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site,"

Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest\nanhydrous ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released is based on 85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards.   The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is miles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.07).  Possible public and environmental receptors within the area has been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) for their consideration.   \n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of anhydrous ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We\nbelieve the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are\nprotected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and \"pull away\" valves so our alternative release\nscenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation\nequipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is (Urban) 0.06  miles\n(317 feet) rounded to 0.1 mile per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American\nNational Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
