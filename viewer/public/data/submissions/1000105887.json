The facility is located in Carthage, MO which stores and distributes petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.  In addition to petroleum storage, Magellan stores butane onsite for blending into gasoline as well as receives propane via pipeline connection that is subsequently stored in an excavated cavern.  The propane is loaded onto transport trucks for distribution.  Both butane and propane require compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations since the onsite storage is greater than 10,000 lbs for each substance.\n\nThe regulated substances at this facility are both butane and propane. The equipment which handles butane include four pressure vessels and associated piping and may contain a maximum of 608,638 lbs without considering engineering and administrative controls. The equipment which handles propane include an excavated cavern, drying process, pressure vessel, and associated piping and may contain a maximum of 25,223,535 lbs. with engineering controls taken into account on the cavern.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe Carthage Facility has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the company's policy to notify the Jasper County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\nThe regulated butane storage/blending and propane storage processes in the facility are compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training"

The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility or if they were recommended from the latest PHA and installed prior to the RMP submittal.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThe Carthage Facility has not had an accidental release from either the butane or the propane process during the last 5 years.   \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe facility is considered to be a non-responding facility.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  Within the past five years the butane storage and blending process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule.  \n\nIn the event of future fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane or propane process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.  The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane process. Changes are underway for the propane process including reducing the propane inventory through idling the propane cavern.  The RMP will be updated once the decommissioning is complete.  As additional opportunities for improvement associated with these processes arise at the Carthage Terminal, they will b"
