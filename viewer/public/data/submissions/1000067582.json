All 14 elements of the OSHA PSM program, the\n\nEPA requirement for developing an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the RMP submittal\n\nare included within the facility's prevention program.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Boardman, Oregon cold storage facility stores various potato products such as French Fries of\n\nvarious shapes and seasonings and formed potato products.  The covered process at the facility is a closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  There is one independent refrigeration system at the facility, with more than the Threshold Quantity (TQ) of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe OSHA PSM component elements are organized as follows: 1) Employees participate in the\n\nelements of this safety and release prevention program whenever possible; 2) Ammonia awareness\n\nand PSM training is provided to all employees, operators and maintenance personnel receive\n\nadditional training; 3) Process Safety Information (PSI) is maintained on the covered processes; 4)\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHA) of the covered processes were conducted and will be periodically\n\nreviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; 5) The Mechanical Integrity program ensures the covered\n\nprocesses will continue to operate as designed; 6) Operating and Maintenance procedures provide\n\noperators and maintenance staff the information necessary to safely operate and maintain the\n\ncovered processes; 7) Contractors working on or near the system are selected through a rigorous\n\nreview of their safety performance and relevant experience, and are briefed on the hazards and\n\nsafety requirements of the job before being allowed to perform work at the facility; 8) Hot Work\n\nPermits are required whenever welding, cutting, grinding or other a"

The EAP\n\nhas been reviewed with the Boardman Fire Department and the Morrow County Local Emergency\n\nPlanning Committee (LEPC). The purpose of the plan is to establish policies and procedures for\n\nprotecting the health and safety of employees, contractors, and visitors, and to comply with all\n\napplicable federal and state regulations.
