The covered process at the facility is a closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  There is one independent refrigeration system at the facility, with more than the Threshold Quantity (TQ) of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe OSHA PSM component elements are organized as follows: 1) Employees participate in the\r\nelements of this safety and release prevention program whenever possible; 2) Ammonia awareness\r\nand PSM training is provided to all employees, operators and maintenance personnel receive\r\nadditional training; 3) Process Safety Information (PSI) is maintained on the covered processes; 4)\r\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHA) of the covered processes were conducted and will be periodically\r\nreviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; 5) The Mechanical Integrity program ensures the covered\r\nprocesses will continue to operate as designed; 6) Operating and Maintenance procedures provide\r\noperators and maintenance staff the information necessary to safely operate and maintain the\r\ncovered processes; 7) Contractors working on or near the system are selected through a rigorous\r\nreview of their safety performance and relevant experience, and are briefed on the hazards and\r\nsafety requirements of the job before being allowed to perform work at the facility; 8) Hot Work\r\nPermits are required whenever welding, cutting, grinding or other a"
