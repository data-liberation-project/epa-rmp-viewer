      "SummaryText": "The Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. Morris Facility is a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) products pipeline breakout storage facility and an LPG truck terminal.  Most of the facility is regulated under the US Department of Transportation (DOT), which also has emergency planning requirements, and is, therefore, exempt from the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  However, the LPG underground storage cavern and the ethyl mercaptan storage tanks are required to have a Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\nThe facility's storage cavern receives mixed LPGs (primarily comprised of ethane with smaller amounts of propane and butane) by pipeline and stores it on an as-needed (by customer) basis.  The storage cavern has a 4,200,000 gallon capacity.  The truck loading terminal portion of the facility has ethyl mercaptan storage in quantities above regulated levels.  The ethyl mercaptan is an odorant that is added to the LPGs during the loading process.\n\nThe storage cavern and truck terminal area have process controls in place to prevent or minimize an emergency release, including automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment.  In addition, the facility has UV/IR fire detection \"eyes\" process area detectors.\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for this facility is a release of LPG from the cavern due to aboveground piping failure that results in a vapor cloud explosion.  The quantity of LPG released in the WCS is estimated to be 420,000 gallons (1,200,000 pounds).  Under EPA requirements, the WCS assumes weather conditions that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible, and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are functioning.  Based on these assumptions, the WCS vapor cloud explosion could potentially affect nearby public receptors.  The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the potential for the worst case scenario to occur.\n\nThe facility complies"

Facility personnel undergo operations competency training and testing, and emergency response training and drills. The response training and drills program includes notification of the State Emergency Planning Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and local fire department. These three agencies also receive SARA Tier II Chemical Inventory reports annually.  In addition, the facility is inspected and audited on a compliance schedule.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted at least every five years as part of the OSHA PSM requirements. \n\nThe facility has not had any reportable chemical release accidents from the non-DOT parts of the facility in the past five years."
