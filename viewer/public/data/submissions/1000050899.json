The Pleasant Valley Compressor Station was constructed to remove sufficient hydrocarbon liquids to reduce the heat content of the gas to within pipeline specifications.  The gas plant is designed to remove up to 10,000 gallons per day from a 40 MMSCFD gas stream.   Liquid hydrocarbons are removed from the gas and are stored in one 18,000 gallon NGL storage tanks.  The liquid hydrocarbons are then transported via high pressure tanker truck to a fractionation facility for further processing.  The tanks are unloaded daily.\n\n\n\nThe Pleasant Valley Compressor Station is located over 4 miles south of the city of Myton, Utah.  The gas plant is located NW1/4, SW 1/4, Section 10 T4S, R2W in Duchesne County Utah. There are no public receptors in the immediate area.  The gas plant is normally unmanned; however the facility is inspected daily by Newfield personnel and tanker truck personnel.  The emergency shut off for the gas plant is located in several exit points of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.   \n\nThis facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to isolate, shutdown gas plant operations from the emergency shutoff, and stay away until the situation is safe. Liquid hydrocarbons will also be removed if possible without endangering personnel.  Once the site is determined to be safe, equipment will be repaired.  The Roosevelt Fire Department or the Duchesne Fire Department will not respond to any emergency at the gas plant unless requested to do so by a Newfield supervisor.  If Fire Department support is requested, Newfield personnel will supervise and coordinate all activit"

People will be kept away from the gas plant until the site is determined to be safe by Newfield personnel. \n\n(24 Hour)Emergency numbers to call, in order are:  Trevor Arnold at (435)823-4114, and Garrison Hartman at (435) 401-0995.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Pleasant Valley Compressor Station removes liquid hydrocarbons from a gas stream.  The NGL is collected and stored in one 18,000 gallon propane tank.  Storage capacity is maintained through routine tanker truck shipments so that the storage tank remains at less than 88% of the total capacity of the tank.  The plant is designed to remove up to 10,000 gallons per day.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario.  \n\nNewfield utilized the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis as a reference to conduct the scenario analysis.  Specifically, Newfield used the TNT-equivalent method detailed in Appendix C of this document.  There was one public receptor within the determined radius of impact, as such, Newfield is registering as Program Level 2 facility.\n\n\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario.\n\nNewfield utilized the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis as a reference to conduct the alternate-case release scenario analysis.  Specifically, Newfield used a leak in the storage tank for a specified duration.  There were no public receptors within the determined radius of impact.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  \n\nThis facility complies with EPAs accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The NGL system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  The site has been graded to prevent potential leaks from the storage tanks from accumulating under the tanks creating a vapor cloud explosion that consumes both tanks.  If leaks do occur, the liquid hydrocarbons would flow away from th"

People will be kept away from potential fire and explosions.  Liquid hydrocarbons will only be removed if it can be removed without endangering personnel.  When the explosion/fires are over and all of the fuel has been consumed.  Newfield personnel will return to the site to access damage, repair equipment, and cleanup the site.  The Myton Volunteer Fire Department will not respond to any emergency at the gas plant unless requested to do so by a Newfield supervisor.  If the Myton Volunteer Fire Department is requested to respond, Newfield will supervise and coordinate all activities. \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.  \n\nNo changes to improve safety are planned at this time.\n\n"
