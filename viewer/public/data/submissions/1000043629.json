The current RMPlan was resisted on June 18, 2009. This report provides the supporting documentation for the 5 year RMPlan renewal submittal.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Basin Gas Plant (IBGP), extracts natural&#129;]gas liquids from natural gas, manufactures sweet residue gas for sales, and manufactures sweet fuel gas for plant and field consumption. The plant contains several regulated flammable substances including methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. These substances are listed in Tables 3&#129;]4 of the 40 CFR 68.130. This installation does not have any regulated toxic substances with an amount greater than the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68.130.\r\n\r\nSince this plant is dedicated to manufacture several products related to natural gas, it has several storage tanks that are used for the abovementioned products. The greatest tank in this facility, the one that constitutes the worst case scenario for the release of flammable substances that could cause a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), hasa capacity of 320,000 pounds of a hydrocarbon - flammable mixture of gases. This tank is identified as Product Surge Vessel or PV&#129;]14.32&#129;]1902. The following gases, and their concentrations {lbs.}, are present in this mixture:\r\nEthane {160,000 lbs}, Propane {64,000 lbs}, Butane {64,000 lbs.}, and Pentane {32,000 lbs}.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply wi"

Ammonium hydroxide is regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 68), more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMP plans must be prepared for processes that store in excess of the thresholds set forth by 40 CFR 68.130. The threshold for the gases that\r\ncompose the hydrocarbon - flammable mixture of gases is the following: Ethane {10,000 lbs}, Propane {10,000 lbs}, Butane {10,000 lbs}, and Pentane {10,000 lbs}. Based on the above threshold quantities, all these flammables substances are required to comply with the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule and must prepare an RMP.\r\n\r\nThis facility classifies as a Program Level 1 since in the case of a worst case release scenario the other property located within the 0.6 miles radius distances from the Product Surge Vessel is a warehouse facility that also belongs to OXY Permian. It is important to clarify that this property is currently in compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR ?\u00bf1910.19). 7 Based on the definitions presented under section 1.2, these conditions are not compatible with Program Level 3 or Program Level 2.\r\n\r\nII.\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Indian Basin Gas Plant (IBGP), located in Eddy County, New Mexico, extracts natural-gas liquids from natural gas, manufactures sweet residue gas for sales, and manufactures sweet fuel gas for plant and field consumption.

This drawings shows at four horizontal tanks towards the south eastern portion of the property but currently one of these tanks was actually removed from the site while the remaining three are seldom used at minimum capacities.\r\n\r\nIII.\tOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the IBGP is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank.  This scenario involves a release of  320,000 lbs of a hydrocarbon mixture consisting of 160,000 pounds of ethane, 64,000 pounds of propane, 64,000 pounds of butane, and 32,000 pounds of pentane.  This inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.55 miles.  Although there are numerous controls at the IBGP to prevent such releases and to mitigate their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\nAfter the distance to the toxic endpoint has been determined, the offsite impacts on population, public receptors,and environmental receptors should be analyzed as required by the RMP rule. The population within a circle centered at the point of release and a radius equal to the distance to the toxic endpoint should be estimated to two significant digits. In addition, all types of public receptors (schools, residences, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas or arenas, major commercial or industrial areas) and environmental receptors (national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges; federal wilderness areas) within this distance should be identified. MARPLOT (Mapping Applications for Response, Planning, and Local Operational Tasks, Version 4.3.2) was used to estimate the potentially affected population within the distance to"

In addition, no schools, hospitals, recreational areas or offices are within the above-mentioned radius.\r\n\r\nIV.\tGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program in place at the IBGP is summarized in the following.  Because this facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n\tA.\tEmployee Participation\r\n\r\n\tOxy ensures its employees participate in all development, review and implementation aspects of PSM and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include compiling and updating technical documents, chemical information and operating procedures; participating in and providing suggestions on the emergency response drills; and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, an incident investigation team, or an audit team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant.\r\n\r\n\tB.\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\n\tOxy personnel maintain a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of t"

Specific personnel within the gas plant and at the Midland Region office are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A PSM information reference form is utilized to document the location of this information.\r\n\r\n\tChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  Documents maintained on file include process flow diagrams, a description of the process, the maximum intended inventory, safety-related limits for process parameters (e.g., temperatures, pressures, flows, compositions), and an evaluation of the consequences of deviation from defined safe operating limits.  Trained Oxy operating personnel ensure that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\n\tTechnical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment are also maintained.  This information includes materials of construction, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical classification, relief system design and design basis, ventilation system design, design codes and standards, and safety systems (e.g., interlocks, detection and suppression systems).  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities. \r\n\r\n\tAll changes to the process chemicals, technology or equipment are subject to the Management of Change program (Item J below) to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised."
