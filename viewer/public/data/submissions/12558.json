Potentiallt hazardous materials are inherent to the water utility industry and all employees are well trained in the safe handling of these materials and proper response to spills and leaks both major and minor.  Engineering controls, training, written procedures and coordination with local emergency response entities are all combined to achieve our goal of maintaining the safest possible work environment.  Procedures are routinely updated to meet changing needs brought about by new construction, process modification, new regulatory requirements, personnel input or any other factors that may result in a more efficient means of safe chemical management and emergency response.\n\n        The City of Paris Wastewater Treatment Plant is located 1/4 mile east of U.S. Highway 271 six miles north of Paris in Lamar County, Texas.  Chlorine liquified under pressure in one ton cylinders is injected as a gas in the disinfection of treated wastewater effluent.  Sulfur Dioxide liquified under pressure in one ton cylinders is injected as a gas in the dechlorination of treated wastewater effluent after the chlorine disinfection process to prevent harm to aquatic life sensitive to the chlorinated effluent.  Both gases are stored in a maximum quantity of 12 cylinders each (24,000 lbs. for each chemical) and this maximum amount is on hand frequently throughout the year.  These amounts are over the threshold quantity for both chemicals and require development of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for management of these gases under 40 CF"

      "SummaryText": "R Part 68.\n\n        The worst case scenario uses a full release of the largest single vessel on site as required under 40 CFR Part 68 risk modeling guidelines.  Chlorine was used for the worst case scenario using the EPA RMP Comp modeling program and gave a distance to endpoint of 0.9 miles for a release of all 2,000 lbs. of chlorine from a single cylinder.  Sulfur dioxide gave the same distance to endpoint so the worst case scenario would apply equally to either chemical.  The distance to endpoint is a planning model used to identify all public receptors such as residences, businesses, recreational areas or any other public places located within this 0.9 mile radius that could be at risk from such a release.  The modeling program uses a conservative approach in identifying public receptors that may be at risk and an actual release would probably not travel a full 0.9 miles before dispersing to non toxic levels.  Both gases are heavier than air and would tend to remain in the low lying areas near the treatment facility.  All residences identified within the 0.9 mile endpoint distance are at a higher elevation than the chlorination/dechlorination facility.  Other factors limiting migration of chlorine or sulfur dioxide include partial enclosure of the cylinders by the storage facility walls and dense forests in the low lying areas.  Evacuation of all individuals 0.9 miles downwind should provide a good safety factor to protect the public in the event of an actual release.  In addition, evacuation in all directions of the release would protect the public in the event of a change in wind direction.  Even though a worst case release would not likely reach the 0.9 mile endpoint, it would surely have offsite consequences such as destruction of vegetation and other environmental impacts to the area.  Since the facility is only 1/4 mile from a U.S. highway, closure of the highway would be necessary even in the event of a release less than 2,000 lbs.\n\n        A worst case re"

Preparation and response to a worst case release allows facilities to provide a maximum level of safety to protect the public from such an occurrance.  An alternative release scenario was required for each gas and models were developed using a quantity of 50 lbs. of chlorine or 50 lbs. of sulfur dioxide released from a ruptured chemical feed pipe for each scenario.  This would most likely happen during a change of cylinders by personnel in taking empty cylinders off line and placing full cylinders on line.  A release of 50 lbs. could reasonably be expected before personnel were able to manually shut off the gas feed from a cylinder in the event of a line rupture and this would involve a time period of 10 minutes.  In an actual line rupture, a 10 minute period for manual shutoff would require an additional problem such as a stuck shut off valve.  An actual line rupture with all equipment fully functional would more likely be shut off in a matter of seconds by trained personnel and would result in only a puff release of a very small quantity of gas resulting in no harm to personnel or equipment.  The alternate release scenarios of a 50 lb. release of gas predicted a distance to endpoint of less than 0.1 miles for both gases.  Previously mentioned limiting factors in the worst case release would be in place and no offsite consequences would be expected from a 50 lb. release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  Even though the highway is outside the distance to endpoint in these scenarios,  temporary closure of the highway may be a prudent measure due to the close proximity.  Onsite damage to vegetation and possible structural damage due to corrosion to equipment could be expected in the immediate vicinity of such a release.\n\n             One reportable quantity release has occurred at the wastewater treatment plant within the past 5 years on 8-18"

The vendor was notified and one of their personnel came to our facility with a B kit to seal the end of the cylinder and prevent any release of a significant quantity of chlorine.  The individual sent by the vendor was trained in using the B kit and wore a self contained breathing apparatus but not a full body protective suit.  The valve broke and spewed gas on the individual resulting in an injury and the release of approximately 50 lbs. of chlorine gas.  Emergency response personnel were called and the Fire Dept. sealed the cylinder with a B kit wearing full body protective clothing and self contained breathing apparatus.  Police closed the highway for a short period of time as a precautionary measure.  Appropriate changes were made to our emergency plan to include activities performed by vendors as well as our own personnel.  Additionally, Fire Dept. personnel are to be on site and prepared for an accident if this same situation again arises.\n\n        Training is the major component of our facility's release prevention program.  Very few mechanical devices are involved in the storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in disinfection and dechlorination of treated wastewater effluent.  These few devices and piping structures are routinely inspected and checked for proper operation and process area alarms are tested to insure proper operation in the event of an actual gas release.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide vendors provide the various safety features of the cylinders and associated valves and fusible plugs in accordance with industry standards.

The plan involves notification to emergency management responders, evacuation to a pre-designated staging area and provide any first aid need for injured or incapacitated personnel until emergency medical response personnel arrive.  All relevant information such as type and quantity of leak, wind conditions, type of container and exact location is given to the emergency responders when they arrive.  The designated staging area is along the access road to the facility and emergency responders must pass this point to reach the site.  This prevents the possiblity of the emergency response team not receiving the crucial information provided by the evacuated personnel.  The City of Paris Fire Dept. is the local emergency response entity for all hazardous leaks and spills.  The Fire Dept. has protective chemical suits with airtight faceshield and helmets and air supply for entering hazardous atmospheres such as chlorine or sulfur dioxide gases.  They also have B kits for sealing chlorine, sulfur dioxide and similar cylinders and conduct drills to familiarize their personnel in the proper use of this equipment in the event of an emergency.

This would be highly beneficial in providing a shorter response time for individuals working in areas and buildings away from the main building and a siren is currently under strong consideration.  The City of Paris welcomes any other suggestions or comments from other that may help make our current plan even better in protecting the safety of our citizens, personnel, property and the environment.  Thank you."
