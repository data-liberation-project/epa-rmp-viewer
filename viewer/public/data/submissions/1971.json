      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n    In this water treatment facility, we handle chlorine which is considered hazardous by EPA. The properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n     The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local Disaster and Emergency Services personnel and the local fire & law enforcement authorities.\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n    - The primary purpose of this facility is to treat drinking water and to distribute to both residential and wholesale customers. Chlorine is received by truck (transports) and stored in the containers which they are shipped in. This facility has equipment for loading and unloading chlorine cylinders from these trucks. Access to the chlorine storage area is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n    - The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this site is 8,000 pounds.\n3. The worst-case release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit distances for each reported scenario:\n    - Worst-case scenario - Failure of one of my cylinders would release 20 pounds of chlorine into our storage room, before the leak could be repaired. It is assumed that any type of leak in the cylinder could be repaired in"

      "SummaryText": " ten minutes or less.\n    - The distance to the endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 0.2 miles.\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable state codes and regulations.\n5. Five-year accident history.\n    - We have had no accidents at this site.\n6. The emergency response program.\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the Commonwealth of Kentucky Division of Emergency Management's Tab Q-7. The facility plan has been incorporated into the county-wide plan for Trimble county by the LEPC. A representative of the county DES visited the facility in March 1999.\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n    - This facility was put into operation in March 1998, so no known improvements will be made within the next two to three years.\n    - Facility personnel will be receiving much more training this year due to more stringent regulations.\n    - LEPC will be using the facility to train local fire & law enforcement, DES and facility staff by staging \"mock\" disasters."
