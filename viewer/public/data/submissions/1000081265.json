              "Description": "This facility has a Process Safety Management Program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations. A safety management system is in place to ensure on-going compliance. This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly safety committee meeting, where a management control check sheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule. The Site Leader has overall responsibility for this program.\n\n\n\nLead Production Technicians are responsible for maintaining and improving the safety of their shifts. Their duties include keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training Production Technicians so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their Shift. All employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation.\n\n\n\nThe Site maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program. Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference. By applying the information it contains, their actions will prevent accidental releases. All associates on-Site have online access to the Operating Guide and all safety related files.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted at regular intervals per the safety manual, to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.  Recommendations resulting from the PHAs are entered into an action item database to track the items to completion.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents. For equipment, procedure, and processes changes, a MOC initiates a safety review. This review may include a PHA. Changes to product formulations initiate a review by a chemist, process engineer, EHS specialist and the Site Leader.  Training is performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact. Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews (PSSRs) are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change has been made.\n\n\n\nA preventative maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment. A computer database (SAP) is used to manage the preventive maintenance schedule. Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed. The schedule is based on mechanical integrity standards and inspection results to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\n\n\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases. One important section describes safety measures for welding or other \"hot\" work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire. The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance. These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\n\n\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices. Contractors must complete a Hexion Inc. Contractor Safety Screening through Avetta that asks for safety information in regards to injury, illness, insurance and Workers Comp. rates.  It also requests information regarding safety training activities of the contractor to ensure that  the training is appropriate for the tasks to be performed at Hexion Inc.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety. \n\n\n\nIncidents that cause or could cause a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence. These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.  The incident investigation system is a computer based system for documenting the incident reviews.\n\n\n\nHexion Inc. performs a comprehensive EHS audit every three years at the Site. The most recent EHS audit conducted at the Facility was in September 2018. Action items as a result of the internal audit were completed and tracked through the company's online system (Gensuite).\n\n \n\n",
