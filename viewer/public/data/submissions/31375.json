This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of this facility. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control / mitigate the release. In the event a non-incidental release occurs, gas plant personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Lake Charles gas plant, located near Lake Charles, Louisiana, recovers petroleum products(e.g., natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) from field gas. NGL is a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, including the regulated flammables ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes, is shipped from the facility by pipeline. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances at the facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Lake Charles gas plant.  The processes at the gas plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's(EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, therefore this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmployees at the Lake Charles gas plant are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant. In addition, the gas plant has initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Lake Charles gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis / configuration information. The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation program to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's). For specific process areas the plant has documented safety related limits for specific process related parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition). The gas plant ensures that the process is\nmaintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nTechnical documents are maintained at the plant that provide information about the design and construction of the process and equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis "

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe \"What If\" analysis technique is primarily used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Lake Charles gas plant maintains written procedures "

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. These procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  The procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lake Charles gas plant has implemented a  comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors "

In addition, the Lake Charles gas plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Lake Charles gas plant, conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklist(s) to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Lake Charles gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief  valves, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or the plant management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Lake Charles gas plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Lake Charles gas plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker protection and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance,  (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and  (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in pla"
