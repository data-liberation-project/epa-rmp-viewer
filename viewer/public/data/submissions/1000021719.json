This rule established the criteria of the Risk Management Plans (RMPs) required under the ARPP.  40 CFR Part 68 is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances. \nThe Risk Management Program rule addresses over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 of which are flammable gases, and the accidental release of these substances. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\nThe South Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The amount of chlorine/sulfur dioxide stored exceeds the threshold limits specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The South WWTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed a RMP that contains the following required information:\n* A management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\n* A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternative release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B);\n* A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations. (40?CFR Part 68 Subpart?C); and\n* An emergency response plan (40 CF"

      "SummaryText": "R Part 68 Subpart E).\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that have been implemented at the South WWTP.\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe South WWTP facility in has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the McAllen Fire Department in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the McAllen Fire Department, who will in turn contact CRRC.  CRRC will provide the City of McAllen with HAZMAT response.  The plant staff will receive training to enable an onsite staff response prior to the arrival of the City of McAllen HAZMAT RESPONDERS.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe South WWTP uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the wastewater treatment process.  The South WWTP regularly maintains eight (8) one-ton containers of chlorine.  This amount translates into a quantity that exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500?pounds set by the USEPA.  The South WWTP uses sulfur dioxide to dechlorinate wastewater before discharge.  The South WWTP regularly maintains eight (8) one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide.  This amount translates into a quantity that exceeds the threshold limit of 5,000 pounds set by the USEPA.\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe South WWTP is located at 4100-A Idela, in McAllen Texas.  The wastewater is treated at the plant and subsequently discharged, after being disinfected using chlorine and dechlorinated using sulfur dioxide.  \nThe existing chlorine feed facility at the South WWTP consists of four (4) one-ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers, two vacuum regulators mounted to an automatic switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves, pressure check relief valves, three flow proportionate feed chlorin"

      "SummaryText": "ators/sulfunators, miscellaneous gas piping and ejectors.  A release of chlorine/sulfur dioxide gas could potentially occur in the chlorine/sulfur dioxide storage area and the chlorine & sulfur dioxide process areas listed above. \nChlorine/sulfur dioxide is delivered to the South WWTP by truck and containers are stored outside, to the east of the Chemical Building.  Chlorine/sulfur dioxide is removed as pressurized gas from the individual containers, however; the majority of the feed system is operated through an induced vacuum, which makes the system extremely safe and minimizes potential pressurized leaks along the feed lines.  \n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe storage and process areas for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide have associated hazards that can potentially affect onsite employees and the offsite population and environment.  The USEPA requires that a single worst-case scenario for the facility and one alternative release scenario for each regulated chemical be reported.  \n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario is the one that creates the greatest dispersion of a regulated substance in any direction to an offsite endpoint.  For the South WWTP, chlorine poses the greatest threat.  The largest potential release of chlorine would occur through a valve failure on one of the one ton cylinders located at the plant.  This valve failure could potentially release all 2,000 pounds of the chlorine as a gas.  Under Section 68.25(c) (1), the release time for a chemical such as chlorine is 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls were not applicable to the worst-case release at this plant.\n\nThe EPA-approved modeling program Aloha was used to characterize the effects of the worst case scenario at the South WWTP facility.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3?ppm was determined to be 1.64 miles. Commercial, industrial and residential areas would be affected in the worst-case release scenario. The estimated affected residential population"

      "SummaryText": " is 10,000 people.\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nOne alternative scenario for chlorine was modeled for the South WWTP. The release was established as a leak that would potentially develop in the packing at the chlorine container valve.  A release of chlorine through the 1/5-inch diameter hole in the valve packing presumably would occur for about 10 minutes, before being observed or detected, or repaired.  The release rate of chlorine caused by leakage through this opening is calculated to be 73.7 pounds per minute.  DEGADIS+ was also used to characterize the effects of the alternative case scenario at the South WWTP.  The distance to the USEPA defined toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was determined to be 1.32 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 6800 people.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe South WWTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine and sulfur dioxide equipment utilizing trained personnel in these areas.  South WWTP management enforces consistent operation through disciplinary action for operational deviations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the South WWTP was reviewed for the period from April 2006 through April 2011.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine and or sulfur dioxide had occurred.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  Back-up personnel have also been indicated in the event that members of the teams are unavailable. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine and or sulfur dioxide emergency, (2) information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency response training underway. \n\nThe McAllen Fire Department has been designated to provide emergency responders and equipment to CRRC, who"

      "SummaryText": " has been contracted to provide HAZMAT response.  CRRC will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plant.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nBased on the hazard review and prevention evaluation completed for chlorine and sulfur dioxide, a list of action items was developed and is being considered by South WWTP management to determine if implementation is to be accomplished.  The most notable planned changes include the following:\n* Ensure that the delivery driver follows a set procedure when delivering chlorine.  The Staff will develop a procedure to govern the activities of the driver or vendor while on plant grounds.  It is anticipated that the vendor would have to comply with this procedure when the South WWTP bids the next time for chemical purchase.  The existing vendor will likely accept these requirements voluntarily to ensure customer satisfaction. \n\n* Provide backup power for the plant systems in case of a power outage.\n\n* In the future when the plant facilities are expanded or upgraded, consideration will be given to design and construction of containment buildings to encompass the chlorine cylinders and the sulfur dioxide cylinders designed in conjunction with the capability to chemically neutralize any accidental releases.  This option might be compared with the conversion to a nongaseous chlorine or sulfur dioxide compound. \n\nREVISED EXECUTIVE SUMMERY ? March 15, 2002\n\n* The South Wastewater Treatment Plant contracted Moody Bros. Inc. to install (4) remote Chemical gas leak detectors in both the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide storage areas and the Chlorinator/Sulfunator buildings.  Installation was done on May 9, 2000.  P.O.
