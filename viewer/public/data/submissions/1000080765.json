In 1998, the site expanded its operations to construct the 30% Oleum process, which allows the site to manufacture semi-conductor grade sulfuric acid. We pro-actively manage site operational safety, while minimizing environmental, health, and security risks.  This site is independently certified as an RC 14001:2008 and ISO 14001:2008 facility, and has been since 2010.  We owe our operational success to sound business practices which strive to put operational safety, health, security and environmental impact considerations as a key aspect of all business decisions.  This commitment is found in the Chemtrade Responsible Care Policy and in the Chemtrade Environmental Health and Safety Policy, and is the key to our business success.  \r\n\r\n\r\nChemtrade Responsible Care Policy\r\n\r\nCHEMTRADE is committed to Responsible Care as the key to our business success. Responsible Care is our commitment to do and be seen as doing the right thing. The Responsible Care principles form the basis of our business philosophy towards societal, economic, and environmental sustainability. Chemtrade applies these principles to strive for continual improvement of our performance in the areas of Environmental Management, Safety and Health Protection, Safe Transportation, Process Safety Management, and Security of our processes, products, services and activities. Chemtrade applies the following principles in its implementation of the Responsible Care ethic: \r\n\r\n1. Promoting awareness of Responsible Care and inspiring our employees and others to adhere to these principles to instill a Responsible Care culture throughout our organization. \r\n\r\n2.

Such a scenario is highly unlikely to occur; however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis methods, the distance to concentration levels of <0.01 mg/L would be 3.0 miles.

The alternative case scenario which the site considered would be the development of a leak within the oleum piping system, which would be 4 sq. inches in cross section. This event would cause an offsite consequence at a distance of 0.7 miles. These distances were calculated by the EPA RMP*Comp Program.  The Tulsa site has numerous mitigation measures in place to prevent such a release and minimize the consequences of a release, in the unlikely event of such an occurrence. \r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Tulsa facility has been operating under the principles of Process Safety Management for the RMP Covered Process since the process was constructed in 1998. In addition, the Tulsa facility has incorporated the principles of Process Safety Management into its operation of other, non-covered processes, since 2005. Although this facility is not regulated under the OSHA PSM Standard, our commitment to Do the Right Thing means that we apply appropriate process safety and risk management principles to all manufacturing processes, and use various resources to evaluate and follow the chemical manufacturing industries' best practices. \r\n\r\nThe Oleum Manufacturing process is continuously monitored, 24-7, by operators who have been trained and certified in accordance with the RMP rule.  The site has installed redundant engineering controls, including interlocks and fail-safe technology where feasible to reduce risk.  The site records levels, flows, and pressures within the process. Administrative controls such as audible and visual alarms are used to identify recorded values which fall outside of acceptable operational control parameters, so that problems with the operation of the system can be quickly identified and mitigated.  Site operators take visual readings throughout the production area at 1 hour intervals in order to monitor conditions within the plant and record operational data. Operational contro"
