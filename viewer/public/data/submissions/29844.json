They also have a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication Program, Confined Space Program (if ever needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases for this facility.\n\nThe emergency response (action) program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc., the Houston LEPC (Joe Leonard, Jr.), and the Houston Fire Department.  If a release were to occur at this location, employees would be notified of the release.  Plant Manager (Victor Martinez) will get personnel organized for an emergency action and possible evacuation.  If the operator of the system in question tried to mitigate the release using manual valves, the emergency electrical shutoff switch will be utilized to turn off all electricity to the pumps and components of the plant to prevent any further operation of pumping equipment.  If the release cannot be stopped, notfication to the Houston Fire Department via 911 call will be made.  The Houston Fire Department will respond to a release at this location, and are trained in HazMat operations.  This 911 call will also notify the Houston LEPC so that notification, and if needed, evacuation of the affected area can begin.\n\nThis facility has flammable and a toxic worst case scenario.  The worst case scenarion for a toxic release would be the failure of the tractor trailer vessel storing methyl chloride.  This release, if the trailer were full) would have a release of 36,000 pounds of methyl chloride into the atmosphere.  Active mitigation was considered for this release, including excess flow valves, and manual shutoffs.  Passive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario.  The distance to endpoint of 0.82 mg/l for the worst case scenario is 2.0 miles.  The area surrounding the facility is considered rural.  This release scenarion could impact approximately 73,000 persons in a 6 square mile radius.  This informatio"

The maximum amount of ethylene that can be stored on-site is 80,000 pounds.  The maximun amount of methane which can be stored in a trailer on site is 25,000 pounds.\n\nEmployees conduct proper start-up procedures for these processes.  The methyl chloride system must start with the proper setting and securing of the methyl chloride trailer utilizing wheel chocks, warning signs, and grounding equipment.  Once this accomplished, they can hook-up all items necessary to off-load the methyl chloride, and repackage it directly into low pressure cylinders.  Visual cylinder checks including but not limited to tare weight, ownership stamp, valve threadings, etc. are inspected prior to filling cylinders.  These written procedures are followed each time cylinders are filled.  Employees also have start-up procedures which they follow for starting the ethylene system.  Visual inspections are similar to that of the mehtyl chloride system, except for the cylinders are high pressure cylinders.  These cylinders go through a hammer test, which means the cylinders are tapped slightly with a hammer.  If there is a high ringing sound the cylinders should be in good shape.  If the sound is dull or muffled, the cylinders could have internal corrosion, or may have liquid in them.  These cylinders are not filled until they are properly inspected, and/or have the contents evacuated.  Employees conducted limited maintenance on these systems.  Maintenance, if deemed necessary, is contratcted out to qualified companies who have trained personnel to utilize in the proper maintnenace of these systems.  The mechanical integrity of the system is maintained in the manner, for these contractors have copies of, or access to the O&M manuals  for all systems.

      "SummaryText": "In this industrial gas distribution facility, (Airgas Specialty Gases), we handle several different types of gases.  Most of these gases are repackaged from storage vessels into tube trailers, and/or smaller cylinders.  There are four products at this location which fall under the risk management plan requirements.  These products are methyl chloride, methane, ethylene, and ethyl chloride.  The toxic and flammable characteristics of these products makes it necessary to observe certain precautions when handling these products.  These products are three different process, yet the safe prevention practices are similar in nature.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rulesand regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and repackage ethylene, methane, methyl chloride, ethyl chloride, combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided to all personnel responsible for the use of these systems.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to store, repackage, and distribute industrial gases to the customer.  Methyl chloride and Ethyl chloride are received by tractor trailer truck.  The stroage vessels are located on the trailer itself, and the methyl chloride and ethyl chloride are repackaged directly off the trailer into low pressure cylinders.  Ethylene is recieved by truck as well, yet it is stored in a vessel on site.  The ethylene is repackaged from the storage vessel into tube trailers, and small cylinders.  Methane is received by a tractor trailer truck as well.  The storage vessel is located on the trailer, and the methane is repackaged directly off the trailer into low pressure cylinders.

The transfer hoses at this location are high pressure stainless steel.  Over time, the hoses begin to get crimps, which could lead to a small hole in the transfer hose.  If this were to happen with the methyl chloride, an estimated release rate would be approximately 1 pound per minute for 10 minutes.  This 10 pound release would have a toxic distance to endpoint for 0.82 mg/l of less than 0.06 miles.  Within this small area, there would be approximately 35 persons affected.  There are no residences in this are, so the numbers would be the surrounding office/manufacturing facilities.\n\nThree worst case flammable release for this facility would be an ethylene storage vessel failure, or the failure of the tractor trailer vessel storing methane and the failure of the tractor trailer vessel storing ethyl chloride.  This could release the entire contents of the ethylene vessel, resulting in a release of 80,000 pounds of ethylene, or if the trailer were full would have a release of 25,000 pounds of methane, or if the tractor trailer wer efull would release 30,000 pounds of ethyl chloride into the atmosphere.  Active mitigation for this system is similar as for the methyl chloride system.  Emergency and manual shutoffs were considered.  However, these release could have a flammable distance to endpoint of 1 psi pverpressure of 0.35 miles.  This worst case flammable scenario could impact approximately 4700 persons within the 0.38 square mile area surrounding the facility.  Again, these numbers are based on RMP Comp, and Landview III software.\n\nThree alternate flammable release scenario for this facility again would be a transfere hose release.  As indicated earlier, the hoses are high pressure stainless steel, and are very hard to damage.  The estimated amount which could be released in 10 minutes would be 5 poun"
