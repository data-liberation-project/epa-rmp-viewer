This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe Ferndale Storage Terminal is located west of Ferndale, Washington along the Straight of Georgia waters.  The Terminal serves as a storage facility for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (propane and butane) receiving and sending these products via railcar, truck, pipeline and ship. The Terminal is able to store enough of both propane and butane to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Terminal. Because processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance procedures. Employees also participate in safet"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in a written employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element. \n\nIn addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the facility, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and facility management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address: chemical properties and associated hazards; limits for key process parameters and specific inventories; safety interlocks; suppression systems; vent and relief studies; and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the equipment specifications and operating procedures. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Terminal has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes that are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards and controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n\nThe Terminal uses a variety and combination of applicable methodologies to conduct PHAs.  These PHAs address: facility siting; human factors; qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel; and one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process: What-if; Checklist; Hazard and Operability (HAZOP); Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA); Fault Tree Analysis; or an appropriate equivalent methodology. PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Terminal promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n \nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Terminal have hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Terminal has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes: \n\nRelease Detection\n\nHydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.

The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to processes or other Terminal facilities.  The emergency action plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Terminal has been coordinated with the Whatcom County Fire District No. 7.  This coordination includes periodic emergency response drills and meetings with the Fire Departments personnel.  The Terminal is manned 24 hours a day and has around-the-clock communications capability with the Fire Department. This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident."

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator, including skills demonstration used to verify that the operator"

Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and systems.  Operational and maintenance personnel also receive training on the procedures for conducting hot work permitting; management of change; and other appropriate safe work practices.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Terminal conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedur"

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  When new facilities are commissioned, a PHA is included in the PSSR.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Terminal has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, and correcting identified deficiencies.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner and serve as basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if situation presents an immediate safety concern), \n \nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Terminal has long-standing safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances befor"
