If an accidental release should \noccur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any \nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, storage and distribution of acetylene.   Acetylene is \nmanufactured by the addition of Calcium Carbide into water in a reactor vessel . A chemical reaction takes \nplace and the acetylene is the compressed into cylinders containing an inert filler material and acetone. The \nacetylene dissolves into the acetone in the cylinder. Each cylinder is checked for weight of acetylene to \ninsure that they have the proper amount of product. Cylinders are removed from the fill lines and placed \ninto storage for shipment.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release and The alternative release, or more probable, scenario were based on EPA Guidelines using RMP*Comp (ver. 1.07) to determine endpoints. Populations were determined using Landview V based on 2000 US Census Data.  Results can be review by contacting the facility.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems are in place throughout the process system. These  would reduce \nthe likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, and Emergency \nShut-off Valves , Flame Arrestors , vents, relief valves, grounding equipment, rupture disks, purge \nsystems, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of\n acetylene.
