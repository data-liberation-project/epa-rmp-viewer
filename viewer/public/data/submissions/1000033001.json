The site has one process (with two process lines) subject to chemical accident prevention regulation under section 112(r) of the  Clean  Air  Act and  40 Code  of Federal  Regulations  (CFR) Part  68; Ammonia Refrigeration Plants (UCl and UC2).\n\n\n\nEPCO's goal is to protect people and property  while achieving full compliance with applicable safety and fire protection-related regulations.\n\nThe safety systems at the facility consist of:\n\n\n\n?    Level alarms;\n\n\n\n?    Fire extinguishers; and,\n\n\n\n?    Emergency shut off switches.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule defines three Program levels based on processes' relative potential for public impacts and the level of effort needed to prevent accidents. For each Program level, the rule defines requirements that reflect the level of risk and effort associated with the processes at that level.   It has been determined that EPCO is applicable to Program 3 requirements. Program 3 processes not eligible for Program 1 and are either subject to OSHA's PSM standard under federal or state OSHA programs or classified in one of ten specified North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes are placed in Program 3, which imposes OSHA's PSM standard as the prevention program as well as additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements.  For each Program 3 process, it is necessary to implement the following elements:  process safety information,  process  hazard  analysis,  standard   operating procedures, training,  mechanical  integrity,  compliance  audits,  incident  investigations, management of change,  pre-startup reviews, contractors,  employee  participation, and hot work permits.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES STORED\n\n\n\nThe EPCO facility has the capacity to store up to 13,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a "

To determine the worst case scenario, the largest storage vessel (10,000 lbs.) on UC2 was used to calculate the Distance to the Toxic Endpoints  in accordance  with USEPA guidance  document \"Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program  Guidance  for  Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\".  It was assumed that:\n\n?    Quantity is completely released from the vessel over a period of 10 minutes;\n\n\n\n?    No administrative controls or passive mitigation;\n\n\n\n?    Wind speed is 1.5 meters per second; and,\n\n\n\n?    Stability class is \"F\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Distance to the Toxic Endpoint was determined to be 1.8 miles (2.9 kilometers). Calculation information is documented in Section 3.0 of the RMP plan.\n\n\n\nIn  accordance  with  Program   Level 3 RMP  requirements, an  alternative worst  case release scenario was reviewed, assuming an airborne  release of ammonia  from a 112 inch diameter  hole in the 10,000 lb UC2 storage vessel. The Distance to the Toxic Endpoint of this   release   was   calculated   in accordance   with   the   USEPA guidance   document \"Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\".  It was assumed that:\n\n?    Liquid vaporizes immediately;\n\n\n\n?    Release rate of the liquid is the same as the release rate to air; and,\n\n\n\n?    No administrative controls or passive mitigation.\n\n \n\nThe Distance to the Toxic Endpoint for this alternative release scenario was determined to be = 0.4 miles (0.6 kilometers). Calculation information is documented in Section 3.0 of the RMP plan.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL- SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention  Provision requires  EPCO to develop  and implement this Risk Management Program and to coordinate  a response plan with local emergency  responders for  all covered  processes  that  handle  or  store  listed  toxic or flammable  substances above the threshold  quantities.

The EPCO Union City facility is also covered by Emergency Planning and Community Right-To- Know Act Section 302. This requires EPCO to notify state and local authorities of their hazardous and extremely hazardous substances that are stored over a certain quantity.\n\nThis is to assist state and local authorities to develop chemical emergency preparedness and response capabilities through better coordination and communication with the facility.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPCO Union City facility has had no accidental releases of the regulated substance in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nEPCO  has  coordinated  with  Brian Stump,  Assistant  Fire  Chief  at  the  Union  City, Indiana  Fire Department. Mr. Stump is familiar with the site and the fire department is aware of the anhydrous ammonia storage capacity at the facility.  EPCO has adopted the Cardinal Ethanol (host property to the EPCO facility) Emergency Response Plan for use at the EPCO facility. All EPCO employees are trained on the Emergency Action Plan annually.  In case of an emergency, employees are to dial 911 and coordinate with Cardinal Ethanol.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThere are currently no planned changes that would affect safety at the EPCO facility.\n\n"
