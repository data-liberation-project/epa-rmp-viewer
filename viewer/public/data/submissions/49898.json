The facility is located at 130 Crossgate Road, Port Wentworth, GA, 31407. The resin facility consists of a plant that was originally constructed in 1974.  Overall, the facility employs 40 full-time employees.\n\nGP is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n\u00b7A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n\u00b7A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n\u00b7An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInform"

      "SummaryText": "ation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at plant.  In fact, the plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\nGP limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, GP considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGP prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGP limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GP trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GP works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nGP is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substa"

These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GP provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GP established a management system headed by the Production Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\nRegulated Substances\nThe plant only handles Formaldehyde solution in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program Level 3 processes at the plant.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:  The OCA was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 68, Subpart B.  The OCA is summarized in Section 2-5 of the RMP Registration.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSince 1992, the plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements:\n\nProgram 3\u00bfEssentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nProgram 2\u00bfRequires simplified versions of 7 of the 12 elements of the Program 3 prevention program (not applicable for"

These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  GP provides the necessary process safety information to our Production and Maintenance personnel.  This information is also available to emergency personnel such as the LEPC, Savannah Fire Department, Port Wentworth Volunteer Fire Department as needed.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes.  The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\n\n\u00b7Toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\n\u00b7Physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\n\u00b7Reactivity and corrosivity data\n\u00b7Thermal and chemical stability data \n\u00b7Hazards of mixing substances in the process \n\nMSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the quality control room (raw material MSDS\u00bfs) and in the Traffic Supervisor\u00bfs office (product MSDS\u00bfs) so that the operators have ready reference to this information.  In addition, a list of MSDSs is provided to the LEPC and the fire department for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.\n\n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are used to (l) train employees, (2) perform process hazards analyses, and (3) help maintain the equipment.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Plant performs and updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) at least every five years unless there are significant changes in the process safety information of the covered processes.  These PHAs help to identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the \u00bfwhat-if checklist\u00bf technique to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.

The plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP and PSM rules and in the process. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP and PSM rules and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  The plant trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Plant developed a written employee participation program for all covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of the plant\u00bfs workers are addressed.  The plant encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the plant. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.\n\nHot Work Permits\nThe Plant manages the  hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the plant.  The  Division Safety Department reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant\u00bfs safe work practices, and the plant\u00bfs emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.  The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant.  The following paragraphs describe some of these features.\n\nFormaldehyde solution-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  The formaldehyde stored in the plant\u00bfs storage vessels is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors. The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde storage tank(s).  The storage tank(s) design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant.   The storage tank(s) is surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the tank should its entire contents be spilled. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe plant has completed a"
