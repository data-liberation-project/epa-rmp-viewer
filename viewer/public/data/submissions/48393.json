We also give our refrigeration partners HAZWOPER training on an annual basis.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, the Company performs periodical audits and hazard reviews to enhance continued safe performance.  Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked regularly for timely completion as required.\n\nThe Gold Kist Live Oak Processing facility has an emergency response program.  This program includes an emergency response notification plan, Emergency response drills and drill evaluations conducted annually; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time."

      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Gold Kist Live Oak Processing Facility, a wholly owned division of the Pilgrim's Pride Corporation.  The reason for submitting this RMP is to comply with the requirement of updating when a project affects the Hazard Assessment and to add Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation as the Parent Company.  This facility has two refrigeration systems using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Because the two systems are tied together with a common line, they are considered one system for the purpose of this Risk Management Plan.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in the total system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia on site changed in October, 2006 due to project work since the original RMP plan was submitted in 1999, thus one of the reasons for this resubmission.\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the Live Oak Fire Department and the District 3 LEPC and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two"
