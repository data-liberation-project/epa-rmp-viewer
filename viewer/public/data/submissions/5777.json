      "SummaryText": "\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nFranklin International is an adhesives and sealant manufacturer with its headquarters, research laboratories, \nand primary manufacturing facilities located in Columbus, Ohio.  There are four separate divisions at the \nBruck street site comprising approximately 180,000 square feet of building on fourteen and one half acres.\n\nVinyl Acetate monomer is a major ingredient in the production of the polymer suspension used in many of \nour products.  Vinyl Acetate monomer is listed on Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) toxic \nsubstance list because of its ability, at certain concentrations, to form toxic vapors in air.  Franklin has \ntaken several measures to prevent public exposure to these vapors.  The raw material is shipped in liquid \nform and is immediately transferred to underground storage tanks per Department of Transportation \n(D.O.T.) regulations.  The transfer equipment uses a closed loop system with vapor recovery devices, \nwhich minimize the discharge of hazardous vapors to the air.  This system has been upgraded in the last \nfive years as a result of hazard analyses done on our unloading processes.   In addition, Franklin personnel \nare required to be in the immediate area supervising the unloading of each shipment and are trained in \nproper unloading procedures and emergency procedures.  Vinyl Acetate is transported through closed \npiping systems to the various process vessels in the facility.  Mechanical systems on the transfer pumps \nlimit the amount of material that would be released in the event of a piping failure.\n\nThe EPA has defined two scenarios that must be evaluated for each covered process.  The worst-case \nscenario must be an event that affects the largest area around the facility.   Wind speeds and weather \nconditions prescribed by the EPA must be used in the scenario.  The worst-case scenario does not allow any \nconsideration of the likelihood of the event.  This means that the worst-case scenario may affect a large \nar"

      "SummaryText": "ea but the likelihood of this type of incident occurring could be so low that the facility and those around it \nare extremely safe. The alternative scenario is defined as an event that may occur based on good \nengineering judgement or past history.  The alternative scenario must affect an area outside the facility \nboundaries to be used in this analysis. \n\nThe worst-case scenario for our covered process is the complete failure of a full railcar of Vinyl Acetate at \nour facility.  Since the railcar is placed on a rail siding, no passive mitigation (physical systems that will \nkeep the release from spreading) is included in the analysis.  All of our calculations are based on the EPA \nOffsite Consequence Analysis guidance and lookup tables.  This method gives a conservative result and \nmost likely overstates the area that would be affected by a release.  Our worst case analysis shows an \noffsite impact with both public and environmental receptors (schools, churches, state parks, rivers) being \naffected.  However, it is worth noting that the worst case scenario presented here is extremely unlikely to \noccur.  The railcars used to transport Vinyl Acetate are designed and built to strict DOT codes, which apply \nconservative safety factors to all critical construction details.  The possibility of a total railcar failure is \nhighly unlikely.\n\nThe alternative scenario selected for our process is a failure of a fitting on one of our process vessels \ncontaining Vinyl Acetate.  Although this type of incident has never occurred at our facility, it is the most \ncredible scenario that may affect off-site populations.  The building surrounding the process vessel was \nconsidered as passive mitigation (a physical structure that will keep the release from spreading).  Although \nthis scenario did affect areas outside Franklin property, the impact is minimal.  No environmental receptors \n(state parks, rivers, etc) were affected; however residents within a one-city block radius may be \n"

Upholding the safety and health of our team members, \ncustomers, and neighbors in the community is among our eight corporate values.  Our facility complies \nwith the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Process Safety Management standard and our \nemployees undergo extensive training to prepare them for the hazards of the chemicals they work with.  \nFranklin utilizes detailed operating procedures and checklists to ensure the safe operation of all process \nequipment on site.  Where feasible, process controls and interlocks are used to prevent accidental releases.  \nWe feel the fact that we have had no accidental releases of Vinyl Acetate, as defined by EPAs Risk \nManagement Program, is a direct result of the safety programs we have in place.\n\n\n\nFranklin International has employees trained for response to hazardous material releases and, as a backup, \nhas contracted with an outside firm who is capable of responding to large chemical releases.  In addition, \nwe have coordinated with local emergency response units and share information about our facility layout \nand hazardous chemicals on site with them on a regular basis.  We periodically conduct evacuation drills \nand mock emergencies to maintain a high level of awareness among our employees.  Currently, our \noperators are being phased through a certification and training program that reinforces safe operating \npractices and emergency procedures.\n\nIn summary, Franklin International is dedicated to providing a safe environment not only for our employees \nbut also for our neighbors in the community.  Capital funds are appropriated every year to strengthen our \nsafety and environmental programs and implement continuous improvement projects and process hazard \nanalysis recommendations.
