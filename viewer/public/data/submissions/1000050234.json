      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nThe Robin Hill Dew Point Control Facility is implementing the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The facility is also implementing the elements of Williams Midstream's System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.\r\n\r\nThe Robin Hill Dew Point Control Facility's Emergency Response Plan is site-specific. It includes required actions by facility employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nThe facility consists of inlet mechanical filters and separators, an inlet gas compressor, a refrigerant compressor, a skid-mounted refrigeration natural gas processing unit, two NGL (natural gas liquids) pressure vessel storage tanks, a condensate stabilizer, a natural gas condensate pressure storage tank, and a fired heater. Facility inlet piping is 6 and outlet piping is 4.\r\n\r\nThe facility receives raw natural gas from several nearby gas wells. The function of the facility is to remove liquids from the wellhead gas prior to injection of the gas into an interstate gas pipeline system. Liquids are first removed by mechanical separation. The raw gas is then compressed. Water is then removed from the gas via glycol dehydration, and finally NGLs are removed from the gas by way of a propane refrigeration process. The processed natural gas is then injected into the interstate gas pipeline. The NGLs are stored onsite in two\r\npressure vessel storage tanks for removal by truck as needed. Natural gas condensate is stored in a low pressure storage tank for removal by truck as needed.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nThe Robin Hill Dew Point Control Facility is i"

Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas facility processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for Robin Hill Dew Point Control Facility will be coordinated with the Midway Fire Department. The Robin Hill Dew Point Control Facility has 24-hour communications capability with the Midway Fire Department through the local 911 system. The Facility is in the process of coordinating periodic emergency drills that involve the Midway Fire Department.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nThe Robin Hill Facility is in the process of evaluating and implementing the recommendations from the most recent Process Hazard Analysis. These recommendations include engineering reviews of piping specifications and process control logic, the installation of additional process controls and modifications to operating procedures. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with this process."

Key elements of these programs include:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the facility to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Robin Hill Dew Point Control Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround.\r\n\r\nContractors: The Robin Hill Dew Point Control Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process\r\nequipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: Robin Hill Dew Point Control Facility has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergen"

The program includes Classroom, OJT, and computer-based training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable RMP / PSM / SIP procedures and regulations.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History:\r\nNo release of a regulated substance has occurred in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nThe Robin Hill Dew Point Control Facility maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances.
