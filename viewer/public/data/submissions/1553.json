Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe management, and employees of the City of Manteca, Wastewater Quality Control Facilities, 2450 West Yosemite Avenue facility (herein referred to as the Facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of chlorine, and sulfur dioxide.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the treatment of municipal sewage and the subsequent discharge for irrigation or to public waterways, of treated water.\n\nChlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas are received, stored, and distributed within the plant for treatment of processed waters prior to discharge to the San Joaquin River.  The chlorine serves to disinfect the water and the sulfur dioxide neutralizes excess chlorine present after a prescribed residence time.  Neither gas is used when treated water is utilized for irrigation. \n\nChlorine is received by truck, packaged in one-ton cylinders. The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at this facility is 20,000 pounds, 10 cylinders (Figure 3).\n\nSulfur dioxide is received by truck, packaged in one-ton cylinders. The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide stored at this facility is 14,000 pounds, 7 cylinders (Figure 3).\n\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\na.  Chlorine Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternative release scenario is failure of a storage cylinder when filled to the greatest amount that would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.0087 mg/l) is 4.6 miles.   The second alternative relea"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.0087 mg/l) is 0.3 mile. \n\nb.  Sulfur Dioxide Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of a storage cylinder when filled to the greatest amount that would release 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.0078 mg/l) is 5.4 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a storage cylinder modeled with a rupture of the flexible hose coupling.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.0078 mg/l) is 0.2 mile.\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nChlorine: The Facility has implemented the provisions of the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders; and U.S. OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.38, Employee emergency response plan and fire prevention plans; and U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.   \n\nSulfur Dioxide: The Facility has implemented the provisions of the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders; and U.S. OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.38, Employee emergency response plan and fire prevention plans; and U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.   \n\n5. Five-year Accident History\n\na.There have been no accidental releases or near misses of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years that:\n\nHave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nHave resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the follo"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific planned changes to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at the facility are listed in the Facility PHAs."
