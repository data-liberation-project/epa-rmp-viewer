      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nExxon modified its safety programs in 1992 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the \"environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.\"  They went on to say, \"We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\n\nThe Hawkins Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it until local emergency response organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in other sections of this RMPlan.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \nThis plant, located 1.5 miles north of Hawkins, Texas, consists of one Program Level 3 process, which utilizes several operations (e.g., compression, dehydration, absorption, distillation, refrigeration, separation, cryogenic) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  This plant could contain up to 3,300,000 pounds of regulated flammabl"

All transportation of regulated flammables into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines.  The adjacent oil treating station for the field operations handles water, condensate, and lube oil (i.e., no regulated flammables) and is not considered part of the stationary source's covered process.  This plant is located in a rural setting surrounded by pasture and woodlands.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS) - \nThe flammable WCS, as defined in the regulation, is a release of a mixture of natural gas liquids resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is significantly less than the maximum capacity and this equipment is protected by pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release.  No mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The WCS could have some off-site impacts, and the impact area includes several public receptors and no environmental receptors. \n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) - \nThe flammable ARS is a release of propane from overfilling a storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  Even though this event is unlikely (i.e., process is protected by periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel), the inventory of flammable materials was assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this ARS.  The ARS could have some off-site impacts, but the impact area does not include any public or environmental receptors"

Because processes at this plant regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to (and in compliance with) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation -\nThis plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at this plant and addresses each program element.  In addition, this plant has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) -\nThis plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Plant Superintendent at this plant is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in material safety data sheets.

This plant ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\nThis plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) -\nThis plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThis plant primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  This technique is recognized by OSHA as an acceptable hazard evaluation technique for PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of plant operating/maintenance personnel and facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering personnel, operations personnel, and management.  Operating personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on a relative risk.

Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures -\nThis plant maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations (e.g., startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, cold startup) and provide guidance on how to respond to upper/lower limit exceedances for specific equipment or process parameters.  Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and certified as current/accurate.  Procedures are maintained current/accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining -\nTo complement the written operating procedures, this plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating process equipment.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators (i.e., subject matter experts) to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., hands-on skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.

Plant personnel receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific duties.  \n\nThe emergency action program is reviewed annually and updated when necessary.  Plan changes required because of modifications to the facilities or emergency equipment are administered through the Management of Change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for this plant is coordinated with the Hawkins Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Hawkins Volunteer Fire Department, Wood County Sheriff's Department, and local ambulance services.  This plant has around-the-clock communications capability with these emergency response organizations, and these organizations are responsible (if necessary) for notifying the public, coordinating the community response (e.g., blocking off roads, evacuation, etc.), and providing on-site response (e.g., fire fighting, medical treatment, etc.).  This plant conducts periodic emergency action drills and provides periodic refreshers to the local emergency response organizations on the hazards associated with the plant operations.\n\nRecent Changes to Improve Safety\nOur Operations Integrity Management Systems form the cornerstone for continuous improvement in our safety-related systems.  These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through many small improvement steps.  These improvement steps are tightly integrated with our training programs.  This plant resolves all findings from PHAs, incident investigations, and safety audits.  The following are some of the changes that are currently being implemented (or were recently completed) to improve the safety of this operation:\n1. Upgrading equipment failure analysis process.\n2. Reduced maximum potential inventory of hazardous chemicals (chlorine and ammonia).\n3. Established carseal open/carseal close tagging and log book.\n4. Implemented pressure relief valve sizing and design"
