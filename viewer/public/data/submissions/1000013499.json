This commitment is demonstrated by our dedication of staff and resources to our accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training and self audits.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\nThe TASS Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine for disinfection in the treatment of water before distribution.  The Facility is coordinated with Monroe County Emergency Management, which will provide trained emergency response personnel to respond to a catastrophic release of chlorine.\nChlorine is the only regulated substance at the plant.  The 2,000-lb container is the largest storage vessel on=site and all containers are located in an enclosed building.  The TASS Water Treatment Plant did not have reportable accidental releases in the previous five-year period.\nThe chlorination must meet Program 3 prevention requirements.  The elements in the program include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractors.  Addressing the requirements of each element provides the foundation for the facilityA?s accidental release program.  The program is integrated into the operation of the chlorination system by the facilityA?sA? management and operations and maintenance staff.\nThe facility has an emergency response plan in place to enable staff to effectively respond to a chlorine release, minimize injuries, lessen the impact to the surrounding community, and provide guidance to emergency response personnel.  The facilityA?s staff is trained to respond to minor chlorine leaks and to follow established procedures on visitor and staff accou"
