      "SummaryText": "The Naval Station Norfolk, VA is a naval base located in Norfolk, Va.  The base is home to the Defense Distribution Norfolk, Virginia (DDNV).  The DDNV provides standard packing operations, specialized storage operations, cold storage warehousing as well as hazardous material packing and shipping.  The majority of their workload comes from supplying the Navy?s Atlantic and Mediterranean fleets, Atlantic bases, and numerous shore establishments.  The DDNV also serves as a supply point for a portion of the Navy that supports North Atlantic Treaty Organization and provides humanitarian efforts in the United States, the Caribbean, and other countries.\n\nThe DDNV cold storage facility is located in building CEP-156 on the southwest portion of the Sewell?s Point Area of the Naval Base Norfolk.  This facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant in quantities which exceed the minimum threshold levels of the chemical accident prevention provisions of the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe prevention program for the ammonia process consists of engineering and administrative controls.  Within building CEP-156, there are ammonia sensors to detect releases.  There is also a watchstander at the facility, who is trained for the possibility of a release.  The ammonia sensors are connected to an alarm system that notifies the Naval Station Norfolk Fire Department of an ammonia release.  All ammonia refrigeration employees are trained by the current contractor, Webb Technologies, to insure that all employees are knowledgeable of the process and how to respond in the event of an emergency.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on 4 May 2006 and included additional what-if scenarios, but revealed no additional safety issues that need to be addressed.  Minor corrections were also made to information previously provided in the original PHA.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process has had no accidents within the last five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program designates the Naval Station Norfolk Fire Depa"

      "SummaryText": "rtment as the first to responders to an emergency.  If an ammonia sensor goes off, the Fire Department will automatically be notified.  The Fire Department would respond with Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and air sampling devices to determine if there is a leak.  If the problem is minor, Webb Technologies will be given the responsibility of repairing the leak.  If the Hazmat Team must be assembled, the Fire Department will radio the Hazmat Team to respond.  If the problem is too large for the Naval Station Norfolk Fire Department, the City of Norfolk can be asked to assist in the event of an emergency.\n\nChanges since the previous RMP submission include the installation of a new ammonia detection system.  This new system is wired to the Naval Station Norfolk Fire Department, reducing the need for building personnel to call in the event of an emergency.  Another change is the addition of new emergency generator at building CEP-156.  This generator will automatically run if there is a power outage at building CEP-156, which will allow the ventilation system and alarms to continue running, making the building safer for CEP-156 personnel."
