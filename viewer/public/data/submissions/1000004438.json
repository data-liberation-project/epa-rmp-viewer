The Chemical Company) has approximately 240 employees on site and operates around the clock, seven days a week. The site has three finished product plants, which produce chemicals that are used in all phases of water treatment; from municipal wastewater treatment to paper making. Additionally, the site has a monomers plant, which produces raw materials used by the finished product plants. The site covers 225 acres on the west side of Wilroy road and A? mile north of Wilroy industrial park\n\nRMP CHEMICALS ON SITE:\nThere are three chemicals at the Ciba, Suffolk site that are listed under the RMP rule: Acrylonitrile, Sulfur Dioxide and Ammonia solution. Ammonia and Sulfur Dioxide are stored at levels below the RMP thresholds. Acrylonitrile is used in the manufacture of acrylamide, which is the main raw material used at this site.\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION: \nIn January 1997 the site began operating a plant that produces acrylamide, a chemical that was previously imported or purchased.  A process called catalytic hydration of acrylonitrile is used to produce acrylamide.  The end result is a solution of acrylamide in water.  This continuous process (which runs around the clock, seven days a week) is operated by well-trained process technicians using a state-of-the-art computer control system.  The plant is shut down twice each year for preventive maintenance and equipment inspection/testing. \n\nAcrylonitrile is delivered to the site exclusively in top-offloading railcars.  It is unloaded into one of three storage tanks in rotation. Each railcar delivers about 75 tons of acrylonitrile into a storage tank. The in-process inventory of acrylonitrile is, in comparison to the storage inventory, very low due to its rapid conversion to acrylamide.\n\nPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS:\nTwo potential release scenarios were analyzed using the RMP guidelines: a worst case a"

      "SummaryText": "nd an alternative case scenario for acrylonitrile release. Acrylonitrile is treated as a toxic chemical under RMP. In each scenario, a release was defined; then using a vapor cloud dispersion model, the distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated. The EPA defined the toxic end point for acrylonitrile as 76 milligrams per cubic meter (beyond this point, a one hour exposure is not considered capable of causing irreversible damage to human health). \n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\nThe worst case release is considered to be the release of the contents of a storage tank of acrylonitrile. The storage tanks are contained within a concrete dike, therefore the released acrylonitrile will be contained within the diked area while evaporating to the atmosphere. The vapor would then disperse in the atmosphere dependent on prevailing atmospheric condition. Using the EPA RMP guidance for Off-site Consequence Analysis, the distance to toxic endpoint is 1.1 miles. \n\nIt should be noted that the worst case scenario is a highly unlikely event based on the design, construction, operation and testing associated with acrylonitrile storage.\n\nAccidental release preventive measures include:-\n1.Storage tanks walls are subject to ultrasonic testing.\n\n2.Storage tanks are equipped with independent high level shut off mechanism to prevent overfilling.\n\n3.There are acrylonitrile sensors in the storage tank area, which would detect acrylonitrile leak.\n\n4.The acrylonitrile storage areas are monitored by remote camera from the control room.\n\n5.The storage tanks are equipped with remotely activated shut off valve if a leak is detected in any associated pipework.\n\n6.Acrylonitrile pipework are welded to minimize leaks.\n\n7.The diked area can be covered in foam, which suppresses vapor formation. The foam system operates automatically in case of fire, but can also be remotely operated from the process control room in case of a leak.\n\n8.Spill response equipment are available to quickly pump spilled acrylonitrile in"

Containment at the rail station is composed of a sump under the rail car that drains to a second sump, which is pumped directly to the on-site effluent plant. Using ALOHA modeling software, the distance to toxic endpoint is 0.31 miles.  \n\nAccidental release preventive measures include:-\n1.Acrylonitrile railcar adheres strictly to DOT regulations for no bottom outlet for acrylonitrile railcar.\n\n2.Railcars are offloaded from the top only, which minimizes the potential for catastrophic spill.\n\n3.In the unlikely event of an entire rail car spill, the volume would be contained in the storm water containment system to the north of the rail line and into a ditch and catchment basin to the south. The rail system drains into settling treatment system.\n\n4.Transfer hoses are inspected and pressure tested before each offload.\n\n5.A derailer is placed on the railroad track, which prevents any other railcar, mistakenly placed on the track, from reaching the offloading car.\n\n6.During the entire offloading process, the offloading station and acrylonitrile storage tank areas are monitored by remote tilt/zoom camera from the control room.\n\n7.Should a leak occur, a remotely operated shutdown switch is in place, which would close all transfer and nitrogen valves on the offloading lines, shut down the transfer pump and close the storage tanks fill lines. \n\n8.A remotely operated sprinkler system can be employed in the offloading area in case of a spill, which would reduce the amount of vapor released.\n   \nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY"

      "SummaryText": ":\nNo accidents or incidents that meet the RMP definition have been experienced on this site. The Acrylamide Plant has operated with no lost time accidents since beginning operation.\n\nSAFETY PHILOSOPHY:\nThe Ciba Suffolk site has a strong safety culture, led by the site management team. The guiding principles are the six codes of management practice found in the Chemical ManufacturerA?s AssociationA?s Responsible Care initiative. Three of the codes that are particularly relevant to this discussion are: Process Safety (PS); Employee Health and Safety (H&S); Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER).\n \nThe Suffolk siteA?s process safety efforts are managed via the siteA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Committee, which is comprised of employees from each production area as well as environmental, health and safety personnel. The committee, which meets monthly, monitors PSM issues, hosts training activities and performs PSM audits. Regarding employee H&S, the Suffolk site has been a Virginia Occupational Safety & Health Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR facility since October 2001. The elements of the VPP program includes: management commitment and planning, employee participation, self auditing, contractor safety, job safety analysis and process reviews. We also have a site Safety Committee, which provides a forum for communicating environmental health and safety concerns. All employees are invited to participate in the monthly meetings by this committee.  \n\nOur CAER program is evidenced by our participation in the Ciba Community Advisory Panel (CAP), the Suffolk Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and other community outreach efforts. The CAP is comprised of Ciba employees, residents of our neighborhood, civic leaders and emergency services representatives. The CAP, which meets quarterly, provides a forum for our neighbors to express their interest and concerns with the site.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE:\nSuffolk site emergency response efforts are led and d"

Our ERT is currently comprised of approximately 50 Ciba emergency responders and 7 support personnel. Of the 50 personnel, there are 8 people certified as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).  Normally there is a minimum of 6 fully trained responders on-site at all times. The site also has an active fire brigade composed of 27 structurally certified fire fighters.\n\nOn-site drills are held four times each year and we participate in an annual drill held by the Suffolk LEPC, which includes local emergency services and other local industry. We have an automated on-site emergency notification system for coordinating emergency response efforts.  Off-site emergency response is initiated via the siteA?s Emergency Response Plan, and is coordinated by the Suffolk Fire Department with other emergency resources as needed. \n"
