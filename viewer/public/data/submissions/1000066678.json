The facility has discussed this policy with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: Compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the terminal is periodically evaluated for improvements. An ongoing dialogue with the Minnehaha County Emergency Management Department will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops."

The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 160,000 pounds.  \r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Corson Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  The terminal is subject to the Prevention Program/Program 3 requirements. \r\n\r\nPotential Release Scenarios: The facility evaluated both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  KF's evaluation took into account process knowledge, hazard review, mitigation measures and safe-guards (i.e. dike, emergency shut-down"
