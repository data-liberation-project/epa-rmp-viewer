Brandenburg facility (a fully owned subsidiary of Lonza), we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as  protect the environment.  As a company, we are committed to excellence in health, safety, and the environment.  Arch Chemicals operates under the philosophy that all accidents are preventable?all of the time.  Our Vision Zero initiative is all about striving to achieve zero recordable injuries, zero environmental incidents, zero manufacturing process incidents, and zero distribution incidents.  The same dedication to excellence marks our Product Stewardship initiative, under which we address health, safety, and the environment throughout each product's life cycle.\n\n\n\nThe following sections provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities in practice at the Brandenburg facility.  Also attached are the data elements from our risk management program that are required by EPA's RMP rule.\n\n\n\n2.0    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n    The Arch Chemicals Brandenburg facility is a 220-acre site located east of Brandenburg, Kentucky.  The facility is divided into 10 distinct units:  Ethylene Oxide, Propylene Glycol/Glycol Ethers;, Light Hydro Carbons (LHC), Polychemicals, Polymer Polyol, Microelectronics, Pilot Plant, Utilities, Waste Water Treatment,and Warehouse/Shipping.  Primary products of the facility include propylene glycols, polyether polyols, glycol ethers and microelectronic chemicals.  The ethylene oxide and light hydrocarbon facilities have remained shutdown since 2000.  \n\n\n\nIn our processes, we use the following toxic chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to"

The required assumption is that the entire contents of the tank are released in 10 minutes.    Using the EPA OCA tables, rural topography and stipulated meteorology (wind speed of 1.5 m/sec and F stability class), and passive mitigation measures, the ethylene oxide could travel a significant distance before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  A release of this magnitude could potentially impact area residences and Meade County, Hardin County, and Harrison County schools.  Environmental receptors within this 12 mile radius include Otter Creek State Park, the Fort Knox military base, South Harrison State Park, and Mosquito Creek Nature Conservatory.  Although unrealistic, this scenario meets the requirements of a release of the largest quantity from a vessel that has the potential for the farthest off-site impact.  Although passive mitigation in the form of dikes were considered for this release scenario, the facility also has sprinkler and deluge systems that would be utilized in a release of this type but were not considered in the consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nToxics:  Alternate Release Scenario\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the EPA RMP rule, a more credible alternate release scenario was considered for each toxic chemical.  This scenario is often called the planning scenario because we use the information to develop our detailed emergency response plan.  While a number of scenarios are considered for each of the chemicals covered by the RMP, only one for each toxic chemical is presented.  All scenarios were evaluated using the EPA OCA tables and the stipulated alternate weather conditions of 3.0 m/sec windspeed and D stability class.\n\n\n\nFormaldehyde:  The more credible alternate release scenario for formaldehyde conside"

Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.  \n\n\n\nEthylenediamine:  An evaluation of credible releases of ethylenediamine (EDA) from the facility produced no scenarios that could potentially result in an off-site impact.  The most credible alternate release scenario for EDA considers a transfer hose rupture.  Because of shutoff valves at the tank truck and the reactor, only 12 pounds of EDA (the contents of the hose) would be spilled.  The resulting plume  would remain onsite.\n\n\n\nEthylene Oxide:  The more credible alternate release scenario for ethylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the polychemical area.  Approximately 370 pounds is released to the air in five 30-second lifts.  The resulting plume could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include area residences and the Ohio River.\n\n\n\nPropylene Oxide:  The more credible alternate release scenario for propylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the polychemical area.  Approximately 2,270 pounds is released to the air at a height of almost 50 feet in five 30-second lifts.  The resulting plume could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include area residences and the Ohio River.\n\n\n\nAcrylonitrile:  The more credible alternate release scenario for acrylonitrile is the rupture of an unloading hose from a tank truck.

Approximately 833 pounds of liquid acrylonitrile would be spilled, resulting in a plume that could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmmonia:  The more credible alternate release scenario for ammonia considers the failure of an ammonia process line due to external erosion.  Liquid ammonia is spilled to the gravel surface and 116 pounds is released to the air.  The release lasts for approximately 20 minutes and travels a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.\n\n\n\nHydrochloric Acid (37%):  An evaluation of credible releases of 37% HCl from the facility produced no scenarios that could potentially result in an off-site impact.  The most credible alternate release scenario for 37% HCl considers the puncture of a 55-gallon drum.  Approximately 550 pounds of HCl would spill to the ground.  The resulting plume would stay within the plant site.\n\n      \n\nHydrazine(64% solution): The more credible release scenario for hydrazine solution considers a drum failure. An estimated 600 pounds of solution would be released resulting in a plume traveling a short distance before dispersing enough to not pose a significant hazard to the public.                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n\n4.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nA systematic, proactive approach is taken to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.
