The plant is approximatly 225000sq ft. designed for the processing of green peas, corn and carrots. Processing of fresh vegetables begins in June and may run until November. During the non-processing season ammonia is pumped back and stored in receivers in the engine room. The cold storage portion of the engine room operates 24/7 year round. The plant  keeps 30,000lbs. Of Anhydrous Ammonia on site for the refrigeration systems.                                                                                                                                                           The system is operated by four Operating Engineers  who are members of the Operating Engineers Union. The engineers receive training on the job as well as off site. The engineers response equipment consists of radios,SCBA's,cannister masks, level C suits and  monitors.
