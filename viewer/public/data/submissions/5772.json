We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of NH3.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Pilger Fire Department and Stanton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, store and distributed for direct application through sales to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia storage tank is 65,662 pounds.\n\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of our storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consegquences.  We have check valves and relief valves, along with manual shutoffs to help reduce failure.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1901.111,  \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Pilger and Stanton Fire Departments and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire departments and they have inspected our system.  We also have a written emergency action plan from RCI.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic eva"
