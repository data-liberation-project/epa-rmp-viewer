This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of TETRA's processes.  TETRA's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0  DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nTETRA is located in an agricultural area that borders West Memphis, Arkansas.  TETRA produces zinc bromide, calcium bromide, and sodium bromide blends in water solutions that are used as high-density workover and completion fluids in the oil and gas industry.\n\n\n\nTETRA was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold of EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.  Based on process knowledge, TETRA personnel identified no listed flammable substances and one toxic regulated substance kept on site above threshold quantities.  The chemical, its largest quantity on site, and associated threshold quantity is presented in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The PSI is useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is readily available to all employees.\n\n\n\nTETRA keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).\n\n\n\nTETRA also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n3.2  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nTETRA has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nTETRA primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis tec"

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project, plant manager or knowledgeable plant personnel, a person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis, and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\n\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria:\n\n1)    age of process,\n\n2)    extent of process hazards,\n\n3)    number of affected employees, and\n\n4)    operating history of the process.\n\n\n\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

The review is to ensure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\n\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and, most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in completing the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\n\n\n3.4  Training\n\n\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, TETRA has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and subject chemicals into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\n\n\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and are adequate.  \n\n\n\n3.8  Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, TETRA periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members with at least one person knowledgeable in audit techniques.  The audit team develops findings in a report that is forwarded to plant management for resolution.

      "SummaryText": " once per shift to determine if any bromine leaks are present.  \n\n\n\n4.4  Release Containment/Control\n\n\n\nPressure relief valves are on applicable tanks.  Concrete dikes are present around the bromine storage tanks and bromine unloading area to contain liquid spills.  \n\n\n\n4.5  Release Mitigation\n\n\n\nThe following list outlines TETRA's approach to release mitigation:\n\n?    Standard operating procedures identify control, isolation, and termination of leaks.  \n\n?    Personnel are trained in emergency procedures.  \n\n?    Personal protective equipment (e.g., escape respirator and self-contained breathing apparatus) is provided.\n\n\n\n5.0  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nNo accidental release of a regulated substance has occurred in the five year history.\n\n\n\n6.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nTETRA maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures account for the possibility of a toxic substance being accidentally released, as well as the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  The West Memphis Fire Department is the first responder should there be facility emergencies.\n\n\n\n7.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThere are no specific changes planned at this time."
