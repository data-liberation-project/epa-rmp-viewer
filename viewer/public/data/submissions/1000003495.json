      "SummaryText": "Background:\n\nDomtar Paper Company (formally Weyerhaeuser Company) owns and operates a pulp and paper mill located in Johnsonburg, PA (Elk County).  The mill manufactures approximately 1,000 tons/day of fine specialty paper and 750 tons/day of softwood and bleached hardwood pulp.  The mill has a 110 year old papermaking tradition and was purchased in 1990 by Willamette Industries, Inc. who was purchased by Weyerhaeuser Company in 2002 who was subsequently purchased by Domtar Paper Company in March of 2007.   The mill is subject to OSHA CFR 1910.119 requirements A? Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and is considered a A?Program ThreeA? facility under RMP.  A thorough review and evaluation of the millA?s manufacturing process to determine threshold quantities of regulated substances was conducted related to these regulations.  As a result of this review Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) was determined to be applicable.  A PSM Plan was developed and implemented as required by the January 1, 1994 deadline by the Core Team members and its oversight committee.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted during the period of November 12A?13, 2008 on the covered process (Chlorine Dioxide) as required to revalidate every five years.  All of the action items identified during the PHA have been completed as of 3/18/09.  The next audit will be scheduled for the year 2011.  A PSM compliance audit, as required every 3 years was conducted in June of 2008.  The next audit will be scheduled for 2011. \n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies for the Stationary Source:\n\nChlorine Dioxide is generated at the Fiberline as the primary bleaching agent of hardwood pulp used in the paper manufacturing process.  The generation of Chlorine Dioxide at the Johnsonburg Mill is a highly controlled process using an Eka Noble SVP-HP system.  This system is technologically advanced as well as one of the safest available.  Accidental released prevention p"

      "SummaryText": "rocedures utilize the mechanical integrity section of the process safety management program.  Mechnical integrity requirements for the Chlorine Dioxide process include documented maintenance, inspection, testing and repair procedures intended to maintain a high level of operating efficiency and safety.  Additionally, regularly scheduled shutdowns of the Fiberline, bleach plant and Chlorine Dioxide plant are used to implement detailed equipment inspections and preventative maintenance to further minimize accidental releases.    The entire Chlorine Dioxide generation system is under a vacuum to reduce the possibility of Chlorine Dioxide decomposition and includes a fully automated emergency shutdown sequence.  Emergency response standard operating procedures have specifically been developed for the covered process to implement a safe shutdown.  Emergency off-site response notification procedures are posted in the Fiberline Control Room for the local fire department and Haz-Mat Team assistance in the event of Contingency (PPC) Plan.  The PPC Plan is intended to be an integrated facility plan designed to provide instruction during emergencies and is updated as needed to maintain accuracy.  The latest update being October of 2008.    The millA?s emergency response procedures contained in the PPC Plan, including the off-site response plan, have been periodically tested by county wide cooperative drills involving the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  The written emergency off-site response plan has been approved and incorporated by the LEPC as required by Section 303 of EPCRA.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nThe stationary source is the chlorine dioxide generation process where sodium chlorate and sulfuric acid solution combine in a hydrogen peroxide-based reducing agent to produce chlorine dioxide, the regulated substance handled und PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n3.

Implementation and enforcement of the PSM program elements is intended to ensure legal compliance with both PSM and RMP requirements and the safety of mill personnel and the community.  Chemical specific prevention steps include conducting regular comprehensive process hazard analyses to revalidate the process as part of the PSM program and completion of action items identified during the exercise.\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History:\n\nNo accidents were experienced in the five year history involving chlorine dioxide that meet the criteria listed in 40 CFR 68.42(a).\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program:\n\nAs stated in Item 1, the primary emergency response program for the Johnsonburg Mill is contained in the PPC Plan.  The plan incorporates all emergency scenarios and provides guidance for response to incidents in the RMP/PSM covered process of Chlorine Dioxide.  Additionally, off-site emergency response notification procedures are posted in the Fiberline Control Room in the event of a Chlorine Dioxide release.  The PPC Plan is included in mandatory mill personnel training and as stated above, is tested in cooperation with the Elk County LEPC.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nAll action items from the PHA conducted in November of 2008 were completed by March of 2009.  The few remaining action items associated with the PSM compliance audit in June of 2008 will be completed during the next scheduled annual mill outage.  "
