The Facility Policy\r\n\r\n The owners, management, and employees of Clifford Coop Elevator are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n 2. Facility Information\r\n\r\n\r\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\r\n\r\n The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 272,000 lbs in two 30,000 gallon storage tanks and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n 3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\n This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case release scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\r\n\r\n 4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\n The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. In addition, North Dakota Department of Ag rules are followed.\r\n\r\n 5. The Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\n There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offs"
