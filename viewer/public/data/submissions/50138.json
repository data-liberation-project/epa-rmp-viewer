Accidental Release Prevention\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Nashville Refrigerated Services provides a safe work environment for employees. Employee safety is a serious committment and our employees are required to cooperate and participate in our safety programs.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management standards (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Prevention Plan regulations (40 CFR Part 68). \n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNashville Refrigerated Services a cold storage warehouse for the perishable foods.  This facility uses an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities. Since the ammonia system falls under the OSHA PSM standard, the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA Risk Management regulations\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system provides warehouse space at various refrigerated temperatures for storage of perishable foods.  The refrigeration system provides temperatures of -47F, +20F, & +35F. The higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant piping. \n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\nD.
