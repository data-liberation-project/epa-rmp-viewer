Specifically, Rubicon LLC is located on Highway 75 about 1 mile south of the intersection of Highway 75 and Highway 73.  Rubicon employs over 650 people including contract workers and produces chemicals that produce two main products: 1. Polyurethanes and 2. Rubber Chemical Additives.  These products have a wide variety of commercial uses including automotive, building materials, appliances, footwear, and sporting goods.\n\n\n\nIn the production of these products Rubicon handles seven regulated chemicals above the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold.  These chemicals are ammonia, chlorine, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, phosgene, propylene oxide and toluene diisocyanate.\n\n\n\nThe 24 hour emergency contact listed in section 1.8 of the RMP plan is the Reductions Shift Foreman which is an onsite shift position that is manned at all times.   Larry Evans, Bennie Schilling, Gerald Williams, John Hernandez, and Jimmy Stockwell also have this position in addition to Rick Payment. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nRubicon philosophy is that it is management?s and all other employees? responsibility to operate safe, clean and efficient facilities in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.  This is achieved by striving for continuous improvement through the implementation of programs such as Responsible Care and the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).  Rubicon is an OSHA VPP Star site.  Other elements of this philosophy include ensuring that all employees have received adequate training on their Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) responsibilities and that all employees are held accountable for their EHS performance.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nRubicon is subject to several EPA and OSHA regulations including OSHA Process Safety Ma"

      "SummaryText": "nagement Regulations and EPA Risk Management Program Regulations.  Rubicon has management systems that provide for the assessment of risks associated with the manufacturing and handling of chemicals and the continuous improvement of associated processes.  Rubicon?s philosophy is prevention first, through the use of good engineering design and nationally accepted standards, conducting process hazard analysis, safety procedures, unit operating policies and procedures, continuous process control and monitoring, and inspection and testing.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nDuring the past five years, Rubicon has not had a release from a covered process which resulted in a death, an injury, or significant property damage onsite, or a known offsite death, injury, evacuation, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nRubicon?s emergency response program is based on the philosophy of prevention, preparation and response.  Some practices at Rubicon for preventing situations that could possibly lead to an emergency incident are the use of good engineering design and nationally accepted standards, conducting process hazard analysis, safety procedures, the management of change system, unit operating policies and procedures, continuous process control and monitoring, inspection and testing of equipment and preventative maintenance of equipment.  The second and third elements of Rubicon?s emergency response program are preparation and response.  Preparing for emergency situations at Rubicon includes the training of the internal emergency response units which includes exercises and drills.  The internal emergency response units are the Fire Brigade, HAZMAT personnel with equipped van, medical first responders with equipped ambulance and a first aid station with nurse, and teams specializing in vertical and confined space rescues.  Formal written fire and release preplans have been developed to assist  training and drill scenari"

Rubicon has the following internal communication systems: ?888? emergency notification speaker system, two way radios, public announcement system in the units, fire alarms, gas alarms, telephones, pagers, cellular telephones and faxes.  External communication systems include the telephone tie lines with neighboring chemical plants, ?888? telephone activation system for communication with two adjacent facilities, Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) radio, the telephone system with backup switch and power, cellular telephones, and the use of 911.  When Rubicon dials 911, the community sirens that are located at a 2.5 mile radius around the area chemical facilities, the Community Alert Network (CAN) telephone message system that covers the same radius, local television and radio broadcasts can be activated.  These external communication systems inform and coordinate efforts with neighboring chemical plant, the Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the Louisiana State Police and/or the general public.\n\n\n\nRubicon works closely with outside authorities and other neighboring companies to coordinate emergency response.  These authorities are Louisiana State Police, Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, Geismar Fire Department, Prairieville Fire Department, Red Cross, St. Elizabeth Hospital (Gonzales), Our Lady of the Lake Regional Hospital (Baton Rouge), Baton Rouge General Medical Center (Baton Rouge), Summit Hospital (Baton Rouge) and the Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA).  The Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness has the ability to authorize the National Guard Civil Support Team to respond to an onsite emergency.  GAMA also has reciprocal agreements for equipment exchange with the St. James Mutual Aid and Baton Rouge Area"

      "SummaryText": " Mutual Aid Systems.  Rubicon performs annual training with most of these organizations or provides information necessary for coordinated emergency response.\n\n\n\nRubicon has also developed formal emergency action plans such as the SPC/SPCC Plan, RCRA Contingency Plan, and the One Plan for emergency situations.  Rubicon also has emergency internal procedures such as Emergency Action, Emergency Brigade, ?888? Emergency Notification Telephone System, Radiation Sources, Evacuation, Bomb Threat, and Hurricane.  Preplanned emergency responses are practiced and are used during actual release scenario drills.  Other response practices include utilizing wind socks to determine wind direction, a ?Safer? System for air dispersion modeling of a toxic gas release, sampling onsite and offsite by HAZMAT response personnel, the phosgene detection monitoring system in occupied buildings, water deluge systems for toxic air releases, equipment and operating unit shutdown systems and waste handling procedures.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRubicon?s current philosophy on major safety improvements is to evaluate the use of pipelines in place of tank trucks or rail cars for transportation of chemicals. Switching to pipelines allows Rubicon to reduce storage of these chemicals and it promotes less handling of these chemicals due to less loading and unloading.  Pipelines also benefit the public because there is less transportation of these chemicals through their neighborhoods thus lowering the possibility of accidents. \n\n\n\nRubicon conducts business safely and effectively which is demonstrated by our outstanding safety record.  Rubicon has, for the last 39 years effectively managed our systems to minimize risk to our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Rubicon is committed to maintaining this high standard of performance and plans to enjoy many more safe, productive years in this area.  Rubicon is a good company and an excellent neighbor.
