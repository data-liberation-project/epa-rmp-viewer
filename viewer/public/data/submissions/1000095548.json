Accordingly, our goal is to experience zero injuries, accidents and incidents.  In order to meet this goal, we will commit any necessary resource and we empower each employee to use those resources.  One such resource is our extensive suite of safety procedures.  The core of these procedures is a combination of relevant regulations, industry standards, good engineering practices and best management practices.\n\n\n\nGeneral Information\n\n\n\nVanderbilt Chemicals, LLC, - Murray Division (Vanderbilt) is a specialty manufacturer of organic and organo-metallic lubricant additives, rubber accelerators, antioxidants, and paint additives.  Many of our primary products belong to the dithiocarbamate family.  Some of the products are powders; others are mineral oil based concentrates or aqueous mixtures or slurries.  Co-products include aqueous solutions of sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) and sodium sulfate (NaSO4).\n\n\n\nThe primary liquid reactants include amines (primary, secondary and tertiary), carbon disulfide, methylene chloride, mineral oil, hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, alcohol complexes of dithiophosphoric acid, isopropyl and other alcohols.  We store these materials in aboveground storage tanks (AST's), tank trucks, tank cars, totes and drums.  The majority of the AST's are located in Tank Farms in the eastern portion of the site.  We receive dry solid reactants in bulk \"super sacks\", fiber drums and paper sacks and store them primarily in the A72 Warehouse.  These materials include, but are not limited to, metal oxides (e.g., of antimony, molybdenum and zinc), oxidizers (e.g., hydrogen peroxide), and various minor processing aids and additives.  Some of these materials are toxic; some are flammable; and some exhibit both toxic and flammable characteristics.\n\n\n\nRisk Management Program (Footnote 1)\n\n\n\nThe ri"

      "SummaryText": "sk management rule1 (RMP) applies to certain stationary sources that have more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance present in their process.  The list of regulated substance includes 77 toxic and 63 flammable substances.  Vanderbilt's Murray, KY facility is one of these sources.  The RMP rule describes three categories of sources and establishes different requirements for each category.  The rule considers whether the source:\n\n1. has had an accidental release of a regulated substance with off-site consequences within the last five years,\n\n2. could have an accidental release of a regulated substance that could cause off-site consequences,\n\n3. falls into a specific type of industry and\n\n4. is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management rule(Footnote 2) (PSM).\n\n\n\nVanderbilt handles one regulated (toxic) substance in greater than threshold amount and otherwise meets conditions 2, 3 and 4, therefore it is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Vanderbilt's Murray facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance that resulted in off-site consequences within the last five years.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires each affected stationary source to report its 5-year accident history and to determine the off-site consequences of a worst case release for each regulated substance that it handles above the threshold amount.  For releases of regulated toxic substances, the rule defines \"worst case\" as a release whose toxic endpoint reaches the greatest distance from the point of the release under standard weather conditions that do little to dissipate the vapor cloud.  The RMP rule defines a unique toxic end point for each regulated substance.  Worst case occurs when the substance is spilled and the resulting pool has the largest possible surface area.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the worst-case scenario, the rule requires each affected facility to include at least one alternate scenario for each regulated substance"

The following table lists the only RMP regulated substance that applies to Vanderbilt:\n\n\n\nCovered RMP Substances\n\nCarbon disulfide (CS2)\n\nCASRN - 75-15-0\n\nThreshold Amount (lbs) - 20,000\n\nMaximum Amount Onsite(lbs) - 500,000\n\nStorage:  Railcars, Isotainer, Storage Tank, Day Tank \n\n\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nBetween September 2016 and August 2021, there were no accidents involving RMP substances that had off-site consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather Conditions\n\n\n\nAfter the properties of a substance, the amount released and the surface area of the spill are considered, the prevailing weather conditions are the next order of importance in calculating the consequences of a release.  The RMP rule establishes standard \"worst case\" weather conditions and requires each source to consider these conditions when modeling its worst-case releases.  In addition to being \"worst case\", these standard conditions assure that all sources evaluate their scenarios under the same conditions.  Facilities may use weather conditions that are appropriate for their location in their alternate scenarios.  We chose to use the average conditions as based on the closest National Weather Service station (i.e., Paducah, KY) for all alternate scenarios. (Footnote 3)  The \"worst case\" and the average conditions follow:\n\n\n\nParameter    Worst Case    Average (Alternate) Case\n\nWind Speed    1.5 m/s    3.11 m/s\n\nHumidity    50%    70%\n\nWind Direction    180o    180o\n\nStability Class    F (very stable - night)    D (neutral - day or night)\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Disulfide (CS2) Scenarios\n\n\n\nCS2 is toxic and flammable and has a high vapor pressure.  The RMP rule sets a concentration of 160 mg/m3 (50ppm) in air to establish the toxic end point for CS2.  We receive this material in 10,000-gallon tank cars and 4500-gallon isotainers and transfer it to one, 25,000 gallon above ground storage tank. (AST).  (Please note this AST was put into service in October 2016.)  From here, we pump to a 2,050 gallon above ground day tank and then pump at low rates to vessel"

Specialty pumps are also used to transfer from the storage tank to day tank, and day tank into process vessels.  These specialty pumps are designed to minimize leaks of CS2.  Both AST's have double wall construction, located under a structural roof, with a foam deluge sprinkler system due to CS2's toxic and flammable properties.  Both AST's are positioned on a sloping concrete floor which flows to a containment pit containing water.  Water helps ensure that any accidental release of CS2 from a tank will settle below the water thus suppressing vapors.  The AST's also utilize a vapor balancing system between receiving vessels, bulk storage tank, and day storage tank.  This minimizes air emissions as required by our operating permit issued by the Division for Air Quality of the Kentucky Environmental Protection Cabinet.  In addition to this safeguard, Vanderbilt takes other precautions when handling and storing CS2:\n\n\n\n1. rail cars and isotainers must not have bottom valves;\n\n2. all unloading is \"over-the-top\" via dip tube;\n\n3. all unloading connections are bolted (no quick-coupled hose connections);\n\n4. special unloading and handling instructions and training.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case accident under the RMP rule is a spill of the entire contents of a tank car into the area around the railcar at \"worst case\" weather conditions.  Such an accident would spill 10,000 gallons (105,000 pounds) of CS2 into an unlined stormwater ditch.  The resulting evaporating pool would have a surface area of about 4,245 square feet (i.e., 394.4 m2).  In this scenario, the toxic end point occurs 0.78 miles from the center of the release (see below).\n\n\n\nCarbon Disulfide Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nWe used ALOHA to model the following CS2 release scenarios.

In addition, we have a formal safety advisory committee made up of employees from all departments and we involve operations and maintenance employees in all process hazard analyses, incident investigations, emergency response program reviews, and so on.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response \n\n\n\nOur in-house emergency response team is trained to the structural fire brigade (Footnote 4) and to HAZWOPER's hazardous materials technician level (Footnote 5).  The RMP rule requires annual Notification Exercises to test Vanderbilt's emergency contact information for local authorities and regulatory agencies in the event of an emergency.  These exercised must start before December 2024.  The RMP Rule requires Tabletop Exercises on a 3 year basis that deal specifically with a carbon disulfide release.  Lastly, the RMP rule requires Field Exercises on a 5 year basis as negotiated with Calloway County Fire and Rescue.  See the EHS&S Department's \"Environmental Annual Goal Log\" for specific dates. \n\n   \n\n\n\nLoading/Unloading Procedures\n\n\n\nTrained and experienced personnel carry out material transfer activities according to detailed written work procedures.  These procedures are developed and maintained (1) by experienced operation's management, (2) with oversight by the EHS&S Manager and (3) take into account the guidance in 49 CFR 177 Subpart B.\n\n\n\nThe goals of these procedures are (1) personnel safety, (2) protection of public health and the environment and (3) conservation of valuable resources by the elimination of spills and releases from transfer operations.  These procedures are incorporated into this plan by reference only.\n\n\n\nMost bulk liquids are unloaded from tank cars and tank trucks to aboveground stor"

In most of these cases, the hoses are equipped with quick couplings, but only bolted hose connections are used for normal transfers of extremely hazardous chemicals (e.g., carbon disulfide and hydrazine).  Exceptions to the bolted hose rule require approval and oversight by the EHS&S Manager in conjunction with a senior Operation's Supervisor.\n\n\n\nWhenever possible, low pressure Nitrogen (N2) is used to transfer low viscosity materials, especially those that present extreme fire hazards.  Pumps are used in other cases or when the transportation vessel does not support pressured transfers.  Bulk liquid products are loaded in much the same manner.\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\n\nThe EHS&S Manager is responsible for establishing the plant's security.  He ensures that a Security Guard screens all visitors that are allowed to enter the plant.  Among other things, the Security Guard ensures that each person entering the facility through his station is equipped with the required personal protective equipment and that he has received the required annual briefing regarding:\n\n1. hazards present at the facility,\n\n2. policies, procedures and work rules,\n\n3. emergency procedures.\n\n\n\nThe EHS&S Manager also reviews the safety and health programs of each contractor and ensures that they periodically demonstrate adequate insurance coverage.\n\n\n\nThe facility is regulated by the Department of Homeland Security's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) due to chemical of interests above threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nIncident Reporting\n\n\n\nThe incident report system is the core of the facility's safety, health and environmental protection.  This system ensures that all incidents, regardless of severity, are reviewed at the highest levels of the organization.  All incidents (e.g., accidents, injuries, chemical exposures, fires, explosions, releases, spills, leaks, malfunctions, d"

Afterward he will initiate an evacuation of the site and will notify the emergency management team.  Otherwise, in the event of a release of any amount of any chemical anywhere, anytime (including an odor complaint), the Foreman will immediately notify the Duty Supervisor of the incident and then he will attend to the release with the resources available.  The Duty Supervisor must then immediately notify the EHS&S Manager followed by others staff members as needed.  The EHS&S Manager must evaluate the incident and, if required, make all necessary agency notifications.  This procedure is documented in the facility's Integrated Contingency Plan and tested on an annual basis as required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nEach incident report must be distributed to the staff by the next normal business day.  Each report is discussed during the semi-weekly staff meeting.  At this time, a suitable corrective action is determined and responsibility for implementing that corrective action is assigned.  After the corrective action is complete, each report must be closed in writing.  The EHS&S Manager is authorized to close all incident reports (ie, injury, illness, fire, explosion, release, etc).  All incident reports are posted so that each employee has a chance to learn from the incident.\n\n\n\nIntegrated Contingency Plan (ICP) (Footnote 6)\n\n\n\nThe facility has prepared a contingency plan to help guide the reporting of and response to spills and releases.  Such plans are driven by both prevention and response goals and have long been required by specific environmental statutes and regulation:\n\n1. KAR 5:037 - "
