      "SummaryText": "sk management rule1 (RMP) applies to certain stationary sources that have more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance present in their process.  The list of regulated substance includes 77 toxic and 63 flammable substances.  Vanderbilt's Murray, KY facility is one of these sources.  The RMP rule describes three categories of sources and establishes different requirements for each category.  The rule considers whether the source:\r\n1. has had an accidental release of a regulated substance with off-site consequences within the last five years,\r\n2. could have an accidental release of a regulated substance that could cause off-site consequences,\r\n3. falls into a specific type of industry and\r\n4. is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management rule(Footnote 2) (PSM).\r\n\r\nVanderbilt handles one regulated (toxic) substance in greater than threshold amount and otherwise meets conditions 2, 3 and 4, therefore it is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Vanderbilt's Murray facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance that resulted in off-site consequences within the last five years.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires each affected stationary source to report its 5-year accident history and to determine the off-site consequences of a worst case release for each regulated substance that it handles above the threshold amount.  For releases of regulated toxic substances, the rule defines worst case as a release whose toxic endpoint reaches the greatest distance from the point of the release under standard weather conditions that do little to dissipate the vapor cloud.  The RMP rule defines a unique toxic end point for each regulated substance.  Worst case occurs when the substance is spilled and the resulting pool has the largest possible surface area.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the worst-case scenario, the rule requires each affected facility to include at least one alternate scenario for each regulated substance"

Accordingly, our goal is to experience zero injuries, accidents and incidents.  In order to meet this goal, we will commit any necessary resource and we empower each employee to use those resources.  One such resource is our extensive suite of safety procedures.  The core of these procedures is a combination of relevant regulations, industry standards, good engineering practices and best management practices.\r\n\r\nGeneral Information\r\n\r\nVanderbilt Chemicals, LLC, - Murray Division (Vanderbilt) is a specialty manufacturer of organic and organo-metallic lubricant additives, rubber accelerators, antioxidants, and paint additives.  Many of our primary products belong to the dithiocarbamate family.  Some of the products are powders; others are mineral oil based concentrates or aqueous mixtures or slurries.  Co-products include aqueous solutions of sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) and sodium sulfate (NaSO4).\r\n\r\nThe primary liquid reactants include amines (primary, secondary and tertiary), carbon disulfide, methylene chloride, mineral oil, hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, alcohol complexes of dithiophosphoric acid, isopropyl and other alcohols.  We store these materials in aboveground storage tanks (AST's), tank trucks, tank cars, totes and drums.  The majority of the AST's are located in Tank Farms in the eastern portion of the site.  We receive dry solid reactants in bulk super sacks, fiber drums and paper sacks and store them primarily in the A72 Warehouse.  These materials include, but are not limited to, metal oxides (e.g., of antimony, molybdenum and zinc), oxidizers (e.g., hydrogen peroxide), and various minor processing aids and additives.  Some of these materials are toxic; some are flammable; and some exhibit both toxic and flammable characteristics.\r\n\r\nRisk Management Program (Footnote 1)\r\n\r\nThe ri"

In most of these cases, the hoses are equipped with quick couplings, but only bolted hose connections are used for normal transfers of extremely hazardous chemicals (e.g., carbon disulfide and hydrazine).  Exceptions to the bolted hose rule require approval and oversight by the EHS&S Manager in conjunction with a senior Operation's Supervisor.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, low pressure Nitrogen (N2) is used to transfer low viscosity materials, especially those that present extreme fire hazards.  Pumps are used in other cases or when the transportation vessel does not support pressured transfers.  Bulk liquid products are loaded in much the same manner.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n\r\nThe EHS&S Manager is responsible for establishing the plant's security.  He ensures that a Security Guard screens all visitors that are allowed to enter the plant.  Among other things, the Security Guard ensures that each person entering the facility through his station is equipped with the required personal protective equipment and that he has received the required annual briefing regarding:\r\n1. hazards present at the facility,\r\n2. policies, procedures and work rules,\r\n3. emergency procedures.\r\n\r\nThe EHS&S Manager also reviews the safety and health programs of each contractor and ensures that they periodically demonstrate adequate insurance coverage.\r\n\r\nThe facility is regulated by the Department of Homeland Security's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) due to chemical of interests above threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nIncident Reporting\r\n\r\nThe incident report system is the core of the facility's safety, health and environmental protection.

He is further responsible for ensuring that all equipment and its installation meet regulatory and industry standards (e.g., API, NFPA, NEMA, etc.).  Only equipment that meets all applicable requirements and is compatible with the materials to be stored or processed shall be chosen.  All storage and process equipment shall be installed inside secondary containment that is adequate to contain all spills (see below).  \r\n\r\nSecondary Containment Requirements\r\n\r\nSecondary containment means a man-made structure whose purpose is to contain spills and releases from storage tanks and process areas.  Examples of secondary containment are:\r\n1. curbs, floor trenches in process areas,\r\n2. sumps, if they are reserved exclusively for spill containment,\r\n3. dikes or berms around storage tanks,\r\n4. gates on drainage ditches near remote unloading/loading areas.\r\n\r\nAll secondary containment constructed after the effective date of this RMP plan shall:\r\n1. be made of concrete,\r\n2. designed to hold the volume of the largest vessel (or manifolded vessels) plus enough freeboard to allow for a 24-hour 25-year precipitation event (e.g., 6.5 inches),\r\n3. be configured to prevent a release in the event of a catastrophic tank failure (i.e., to prevent spillage), and\r\n4. shall contain a manual valve to drain collected stormwater\r\n\r\nIf two or more tanks can be plumbed together, the total volume of all tanks so connected must be considered instead of the single largest tank.\r\n\r\nEarthen berms currently serve as secondary containment for groups of one, two or three storage tanks in the Area 31 Tank Farm and for two (of three) fuel oil tanks at the Boiler House.  These berms will hold spilled materials long enough (e.g., at least 24 hours) to prevent runoff and to allow for r"

These engineered structures are intended to trap spills, aid in the recovery of spills and to prevent spilled materials from migrating into the environment long enough (e.g., at least 24 hours) to allow recovery.\r\n\r\nContainment structures of both types trap storm water.  This water must be inspected and sampled by an Operator, tested by the on-site Laboratory and approved by a member of management before it may be discharged.  Stormwater release procedures are addressed in the written work instructions of the Utility Operator.\r\n\r\nFinally, spill control and clean-up supplies (e.g., sorbent clay, pads and booms) are maintained on site to control the types of spills discussed in the Hazard Assessment section.

This procedure is documented in the facility's Integrated Contingency Plan and tested on an annual basis as required by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nEach incident report must be distributed to the staff by the next normal business day.  Each report is discussed during the semi-weekly staff meeting.  At this time, a suitable corrective action is determined and responsibility for implementing that corrective action is assigned.  After the corrective action is complete, each report must be closed in writing.  The EHS&S Manager is authorized to close all incident reports (ie, injury, illness, fire, explosion, release, etc).  All incident reports are posted so that each employee has a chance to learn from the incident.\r\n\r\nIntegrated Contingency Plan (ICP) (Footnote 6)\r\n\r\nThe facility has prepared a contingency plan to help guide the reporting of and response to spills and releases.  Such plans are driven by both prevention and response goals and have long been required by specific environmental statutes and regulation:\r\n1. KAR 5:037 -"

The RMP rule establishes standard worst case weather conditions and requires each source to consider these conditions when modeling its worst-case releases.  In addition to being worst case, these standard conditions assure that all sources evaluate their scenarios under the same conditions.  Facilities may use weather conditions that are appropriate for their location in their alternate scenarios.  We chose to use the average conditions as based on the closest National Weather Service station (i.e., Paducah, KY) for all alternate scenarios. (Footnote 3)  The worst case and the average conditions follow:\r\n\r\nParameter\tWorst Case\tAverage (Alternate) Case\r\nWind Speed\t1.5 m/s\t3.11 m/s\r\nHumidity\t50%\t70%\r\nWind Direction\t180o\t180o\r\nStability Class\tF (very stable - night)\tD (neutral - day or night)\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbon Disulfide (CS2) Scenarios\r\n\r\nCS2 is toxic and flammable and has a high vapor pressure.  The RMP rule sets a concentration of 160 mg/m3 (50ppm) in air to establish the toxic end point for CS2.  We receive this material in 10,000-gallon tank cars and 4500-gallon isotainers and transfer it to one, 25,000 gallon above ground storage tank. (AST).  (Please note this AST was put into service in October 2016.)  From here, we pump to a 2,050 gallon above ground day tank and then pump at low rates to vessel"

Specialty pumps are also used to transfer from the storage tank to day tank, and day tank into process vessels.  These specialty pumps are designed to minimize leaks of CS2.  Both AST's have double wall construction, located under a structural roof, with a foam deluge sprinkler system due to CS2's toxic and flammable properties.  Both AST's are positioned on a sloping concrete floor which flows to a containment pit containing water.  Water helps ensure that any accidental release of CS2 from a tank will settle below the water thus suppressing vapors.  The AST's also utilize a vapor balancing system between receiving vessels, bulk storage tank, and day storage tank.  This minimizes air emissions as required by our operating permit issued by the Division for Air Quality of the Kentucky Environmental Protection Cabinet.  In addition to this safeguard, Vanderbilt takes other precautions when handling and storing CS2:\r\n\r\n1. rail cars and isotainers must not have bottom valves;\r\n2. all unloading is over-the-top via dip tube;\r\n3. all unloading connections are bolted (no quick-coupled hose connections);\r\n4. special unloading and handling instructions and training.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case accident under the RMP rule is a spill of the entire contents of a tank car into the area around the railcar at worst case weather conditions.  Such an accident would spill 10,000 gallons (105,000 pounds) of CS2 into an unlined stormwater ditch.  The resulting evaporating pool would have a surface area of about 4,245 square feet (i.e., 394.4 m2).  In this scenario, the toxic end point occurs 0.78 miles from the center of the release (see below).\r\n\r\nCarbon Disulfide Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nWe used ALOHA to model the following CS2 release scenarios.  ALOHA is suitable for modeling releases that result in dense gas dispersions.  For reference, the OSHA short term exposure limit (S"
