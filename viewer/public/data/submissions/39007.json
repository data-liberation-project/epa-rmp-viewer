The surrounding area is developed as industrial/commercial and residential.\n   \nWhitehouse Sales has assessed the potential affects of an accidental release of a hazardous substance. The assessment includes performing an offsite consequence analysis. This analysis includes a worst case scenario and one alternative scenario.\n\nThe Whitehouse Sales facility has established a prevention program to prevent the accidental release of the regulated substance. This program includes safety precautions, maintenance, inspections, and employee training.\n\n An  emergency action program has also been established that requires specific actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. These actions include procedures for notifying public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases and employee response training measures.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Whitehouse Sales Facility handles one regulated substance in it's distribution operation. The substance is chlorine which is used for water disinfection. The chlorine is stored in 150# cylinders in racks at its 6959 Eastside Road warehouse.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental release or emergency incident at the Whitehouse Sales site in the last five years.  \n\nAccident Release Prevention Program \n\nInspections are performed daily on incoming, stored and outgoing cylinders.  Inventories are maintained at a minimum and stock is rotated on a \"first in- first out\" basis. The warehouse is equipped with a water spray/fire suppression system that will trigger in the event of a fire, the event that could result in a chlorine release under the alternative/most likely release scenario.

      "SummaryText": "ceived, stored and shipped in racks designed to securely hold up to 12 to 16 cylinders at a time.  Transport and storage of the cylinders in the secured racks minimizes the opportunity of breaking off a valve, the worst case scenario.\n\nEmergency Action Program\n\nWhitehouse Sales has developed Emergency Action Plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 to insure that all regulated hazardous chemical substances are stored and transported in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. The facility has trained its personnel to respond to an emergency chlorine gas release and take the necessary steps to evaluate the facility and notify response agencies and the surrounding community. The facility has coordinated with the Shasta County Environmental Management Department as part of its annual Hazardous Materials Plan (HMP) review and submittal.\n\nPlanned Changes\n\nAs a result of the risk assessment, Whitehouse Sales will  install an automatic leak detection system and revise/update its operating procedures to increase the frequency and level of detail in its receiving, storage and shipping inspection procedures.  The focus will be on ensuring that damaged/dated cylinders are not received at the facility and/or picked up for shipment back to the facility from the customer?s site.\n\n"
