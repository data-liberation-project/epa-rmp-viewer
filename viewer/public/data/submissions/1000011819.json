      "SummaryText": "This document is the Executive Summary of the Star of the West Milling Co.-Risk Management Program-for the Kent Flour Mill.  The flour mill has chlorine gas on site in the form of one ton containers.  We work together with our chlorine supplier (Carvan Ingredients) and local fire department to establish effective procedures for an immediate response and action in the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas.  We have written procedures for the handling of chlorine and conduct annual employee training on the hazards associated with chlorine and the safe handling of chlorine.  Our chlorine monitoring system monitors any potential leakage in the chlorine storage areas and the agitators.  We are committed to the safety of our employees and our community.  The flour mill provides top quality flour to a number of food companies in the midwest.  We use chlorine gas to bleach certain brands of flour and adjust their pH.  We typically store six chlorine one ton containers on site of which we have three connected and available for use at any one time.  The containers are stored in a separate isolated brick and wood building, which is adjacent to the flour mill.  Preventative measures include training of our employees in safe handling of chlorine, training of our employees in the use of SCBA, (Self Contained Breathing Apparatus), coordinated training with our local fire department, chlorine monitoring equipment in the chlorine room and at the agitator areas and training, monitoring and maintenance in coordination with our supplier, Caravan Ingredients.  Our piping is designed for use with chlorine gas and is inspected regularly.  We have not had a reportable accident in the past five years.  We continually strive to improve the safety of our employees and community with safe handling and useage of chlorine at our mill."
