Frederick Street facility is a warehousing facility and the location of the main office.  \n\nThis facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. The following hazardous chemicals subject to PSM are stored on site:  Anhydrous Ammonia, Formaldehyde, and Hydrogen Chloride (stored as aqueous Hydrochloric Acid).   \n\nChemicals subject to EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements includes Ammonia (conc 20% or greater).  \n\nHydrofluoric Acid 70% was reported in 2009; however, inventory of this material had been eliminated below the threshold quantity in 2014 and has now been eliminated from this facility. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia was reported in 1999; however, inventory of this material had been reduced below the threshold quantity and has remained below the threshold quantity. \n\nThe facility's prevention program includes implementation of procedures to address employee safety and to reduce risk of accidents involving hazardous chemicals.  A neutralization system and a de-chlorination system are installed to capture, contain and neutralize spills and rinse water.  A transfer area that has secondary containment that can be directed into the neutralization tank is also in place. This program has been successful in that there have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.  \n\nThe facility also has a written emergency response plan that includes specific actions to be taken in the event of a spill or leak.  Employees receive regular annual training in both the prevention program and the emergency response plan.  The facility seeks to improve safety by regular review of its safety policies and performance.\n\nIt is anticipated that this facility (ID# 1000 0012 3421) will be de-registered in the next 3 months.  Stock of the Ammonia Solution 30% will be moved to registered Facility ID # 1000 0012 1"
