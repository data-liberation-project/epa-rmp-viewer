      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting treated wastewater.  City of Burbank Public Works Department (CBPWD) Burbank Water Reclamation Plant (BWRP) also stores and uses chlorine as part of the wastewater treatment process.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. BWRP takes its obligations in safely storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing the environment safe disinfected water.  BWRP has an excellent safety record in storing and handling chlorine.  BWRP?s chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  This RMP is the five-year update of the August 1999 RMP.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\n \n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the BWRP Chlorination System is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBWRP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA?s Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, sy"

Instead, the facility has coordinated with the local response agency to respond to any chlorine release that may occur at the BWRP.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nBWRP chlorination facility is located at 740 North Lake Street in Burbank, California.  The water reclamation plant is located on a land area of approximately 6.5 acres, bounded on the east and north sides by Burbank-Western Flood Control Channel along with Southern Pacific railway and Golden State Freeway, on the west side by industrial area east of Victory Blvd., and on the south by an additional industrial area north of Magnolia Boulevard.  BWRP was built in 1966 to treat wastewater; it was originally designed to process 6 million gallons of wastewater a day (6 mgd).  BWRP capacity was increased to 9 mgd in 1976.  \n\nAnhydrous chlorine was used at the facility from 1966 to the first week of June 1999 to disinfect the BWRP treated effluents.  The chlorination system consisted of eight ton-containers, weighing systems, chlorinators, a residual chlorine analyzer, and associated piping.  As part of the expansion of the water reclamation plant, the City of Burbank proposed in 1993 to upgrade the chlorination facility.  The upgraded chlorination facility is also designed to store up to a maximum of eight chlorine one ton-containers.  The chlorination facility has been equipped with two evaporators, four chlorinators, injectors, chlorine detectors, and associated piping.  In the upgraded chlorination system, liquid chlorine is drawn off the connected ton-containers to the on-line evaporator and chlorinator.  The chlorinator automatically controls the flow of the chlorine gas into the injectors located at four different application points where the gas is dissolved into process water to make a chlorine solution.

      "SummaryText": " This chlorine solution is then introduced at the points of application.  The chlorinated effluent is detained in the contact tanks for the required disinfection time.\n\nA chlorine scrubber system has also been provided to neutralize any accidental chlorine release that may occur at the facility.  The caustic scrubber system is able to neutralize the release of 4,800 pounds (more than two ton-containers load) of chlorine.  Upon detection of chlorine gas by chlorine detectors, the scrubber system is activated; chlorine leaking into the chlorine storage or chlorinator room is into a packed tower scrubber, and neutralized with recirculating caustic solution.  The scrubber system is of once-through design, the maximum design discharge chlorine concentration from the scrubber stack is 5 parts per million by volume. \n\nAs mentioned above, the old chlorination station (using anhydrous chlorine ton-container system) operated till the first week of June 1999.  The anhydrous chlorine ton container system was replaced by a temporary sodium hypochlorite system on June 7, 1999.  Thus, there was no regulated substance present at the BWRP chlorination facility on June 21, 1999.  The construction of the upgraded chlorination facility, including the chlorine scrubber system was completed and anhydrous chlorine in quantities above the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds was brought to the BWRP chlorination facility on August 10, 1999.  The chlorination operation runs continuously, 24 hours per day.  Thus, BWRP has only one RMP covered process. \n\nChlorine leak detectors are installed inside the chlorine building (in the chlorine storage and in the chlorinator room), as well as in the scrubber duct.  A chlorine sensor is also installed at the scrubber exhaust stack.  The chlorine leak detection system continuously analyzes air samples from the chlorine storage and chlorination room.  The detector system alarms locally as well as at the BWRP control room.\n\nThe plant is manned 12 hours "

BWRP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n* A management system.\n* Detailed process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\n* A preventive maintenance program.\n* Performance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n* Use of industry recommended process and safety equipment.\n* Use of effective operating procedures.\n* Training of the operators and maintenance staff.\n* Implementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, presence of chlorine detectors and alarms, and a chlorine scrubber.\n\nProcess and Chemical Safety Information\n\nChemical data have been assembled to include health hazard, and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of chlorine.  This information includes chlorine background information and MSDS sheets.\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1993, a detailed process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted for the chlorination system equipment and procedures.  A number of equipment and procedural changes were recommended as part of the PHA conducted in 1993.  These recommendations have been implemented.  In July 1999, the PHA for the chlorination system was further reviewed.  In July 2004 the PHA was again reviewed and will be updated again within a five-year "
