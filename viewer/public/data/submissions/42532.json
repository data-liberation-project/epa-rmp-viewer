      "SummaryText": "     The Fort Benning Water Treatment Plant is owned and operated by the Columbus Water Works and provides potable water service to Fort Benning, a federal installation owned by the Department of the Army.  Fort Benning is home to the U. S. Infantry School.  Fort Benning is located in western Georgia, along the Chattahoochee River, near Columbus, Georgia.  The installation is situated on approximately 180,000 acres, which includes parts of Muscogee and Chattahoochee counties in Georgia and Russell County in Alabama.  There are four main cantonment areas at the installation:  Main Post, Harmony Church, Kelley Hill, and Sand Hill.\n     The facility uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant for its drinking water supply.  The capacity of the chlorine gas containers is 2,000 pounds.  The facility stores a maximum of 12,000 pounds of chlorine on site at any given time.\n     The Fort Benning Water Treatment Plant has not had any accidents involving chlorine gas in any off-site or on-site impacts in the past five years.  Information about the off-site consequence analysis is included in the program elements.\n     In the event of a chlorine release, plant employees do not act as first responders.  There is a written policy (with training) to inform the Columbus Water Works HazMat team in the event of a small release, and to inform the Fort Benning Fire Department through the use of 911 in the event of a major release of chlorine.  The Fort Benning Fire Department is equipped to handle a release or other chlorine emergency to the magnitude in which chlorine is stored.  Fort Benning complies with all fire codes and all applicable state and federal laws.\n     The Fort Benning Water Treatment Plant has reduced the amount of chlorine stored at its facility from 50,000 pounds to 12,000 pounds.  The chlorination system operates with a vacuum regulator.  Thus, any breaks in the lines will cause the system to shut down and prevent chlorine gas from escaping.  All chlorine cylinders are in"
