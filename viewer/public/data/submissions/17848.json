The accidental release prevention program is based on extensive training and maintenace as well as a state of the art refrgeration design which has been developed by a team of refrigeration professionals and installed in full compliance with all applicable codes.  Further the local fire department has been very invloved during the construction process to insure that all of their needs are and have been met.\n\nAs a new facilty there have not been any releases in the last five years.\n\nThe worst case scenario was considered to be a rupture of the high pressure receiver.  The end point radius is 0.5 miles.  The possible rupture is mitigated by enclosure in the machinery room.  The system is protected by releif valves which make the failure unlikely.\n\nThe alternate scenario considered was a pipe line rupture or valve failure of the HTRL pipe on the roof.  The endpoint radius is 0.1 miles.  The catastrophic failure is unlikely because the system is protected by relief valves, preventative maintenance and regular inspections.  All pipes are insulated and covered and are not exposed to corrosion by the weather.  Ammonia is not corrosive to the piping materials.\n\nThe general accident release prevention program relies on extensive maintenance, training and a well engineered system.  All areas of the system are protected by relief valves which discharge into a water tank which prevents any escape to the atmosphere.\n\nThe emergency reponse program is a three level program that is monitored by ammonia detectors located throughout the facility.  The first level alarm is a threshold alarm which notifies the refrigeration operator.  The second level alarm (50% IDLH) will sound the evacuation alarm to evacuate the plant and discontinue all ammonia flow from the machinery room.  The third level alarm (1000 PPM) will signal th"

All vapors emitted thru the emergency ventilation system are scrubbed to prevent them from being discharged into the air.  All employees will be evacuated to an assembly area for a head count and emergency treatment is required.  \n\nSince this is a new facilty there are no planned changes at this time.  The administration and maintenace of the program will be undergoing a continual evolution to smooth out any difficulties encountered during start up, trianing, or practice drills.\n\nThe undersigned certiies that to the best of my knowledge, information and beleif, formed after resonable inquiry, the information is true, accurate and complete.\n\nEric Uhler\nPlant Engineer"
