This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the Ruiz Food Products, Inc. facility. \n\nIt is the policy of Ruiz Food Products, Inc. to ensure that controls are in place to prevent possible releases of ammonia. If such a release does occur, the facility's emergency response personnel are trained to control and mitigate the effects of the release. The facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Region 5 LEPC and the Dinuba Fire Department, who provide additional emergency response expertise. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n \nRuiz Food Products, Inc's primary activity is frozen food manufacturing. Located at 501 South Alta Avenue in Dinuba, California, the facility prepares, stores, and ships frozen food products. Ammonia is the only RMP-regulated substance at the facility, and it is used to provide refrigeration for the preparation and cold storage of various food products. The maximum inventory of ammonia at the facility is approximately 75,000 pounds. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe Ruiz Food Products, Inc. facility is in full compliance with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as defined in 40 CFR Part 68, the requirements for the California Accidental Release Prevention program (CalARP), the OSHA PSM requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, and the EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the Dinuba facility. \n\nProcess Safety Information \nRuiz Food Products, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes"

Checklists and the HAZOP methodology were used to carry out the process hazards analyses. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations, and will be revalidated at least every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures \nTo further ensure that activities are safely conducted in the ammonia system, Ruiz Food Products, Inc. has developed written operating procedures to supplement the current on-the-job operator training. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown and startup, and emergency shutdown and startup. This information is regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \n\nTraining \nRuiz Food Products, Inc. has an on-the-job training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating process equipment are competent in the operating procedures associated with this equipment. Written procedures are used to enhance the on-the-job training. Refresher training is provided at least every three years. All training is documented and validated. \n\nMechanical Integrity \nRuiz Food Products, Inc. has a written maintenance program in place for preventative maintenance of all ammonia equipment to ensure continuing reliable and safe operation. Equipment maintained under this program include pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, compressors and pumps.

This ensures that process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-startup Reviews \nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ruiz Food Products, Inc. These written review procedures formally ensure that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\nCompliance Audits \nRuiz Foods conducts audits on a regular basis to verify that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \n\nIncident Investigation \nRuiz Food Products, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have resulted in a release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from occurring under similar situations.

It documents that appropriate fire prevention measures have been implemented, and defines the work dates and scope of work to be performed. The permit is kept on site until completion of the work. \n\nContractor Safety \nOn occasion, the facility hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Ruiz Food Products, Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of any known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes within the facility. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n \nAn investigation into Ruiz Food Products, Inc.'s accident history revealed that there have been two ammonia incidents over the past five years (June 2004 to June 2009), one of which that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  Details of the leaks are included below:\n\nDecember 2004 Incident\n\nThe facility had an ammonia release from one of the coils in the Freezers on December 26, 2004.  The pipe threads at the inlet of the coil connection had ruptured.  Approximately five pounds of ammonia was released from the system.  An investigation into the incident revealed that the point where the pipe had ruptured was the weakest part of the coil assembly as a result of fourteen years of daily operation and constant thermal expansion.
