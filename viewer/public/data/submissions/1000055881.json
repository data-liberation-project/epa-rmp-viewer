Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. J-W Gathering Company's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community and that comply with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements. J-W Gathering Company's spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, company personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\nFacility And The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Tyler Gas Plant is a natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction facility.  Natural gas enters the facility where the pressure is reduced by throttling.  This causes a chilling effect that condenses the heavier components of the gas, into liquid form (Joule-Thomson effect).  The produced liquids consist of a mixture of ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbons.  The liquids are sent to the 42,000 gallon storage tank on site and then shipped off-site via truck.  The truck loading station is located down gradient to the tank and is gravity fed from the tank. The maximum fill of the liquids storage tank is 85% and the maximum weight of the regulated flammable mixture inside the tank is about 54,000 lbs.  After liquid extraction, the residual natural gas is compressed on-site to boost pressure and then shipped off-site via a pipeline.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nJ-W Gathering Company has taken he necessary steps to comply with the accidental r"

Although the facility is normally unmanned, all equipment is inspected and tested on a regular basis.  Day-to-day operation is performed by a contractor who has been fully trained in general and site-specific maintenance. Generally speaking, the Tyler Gas Plant is relatively simple.  Except for catastrophic pipe/vessel rupture, any foreseeable equipment failure would either stop the flow of gas, or send rich (unprocessed) gas to the sales point.  The facility has alarms to alert staff of compression failure and relief valves to prevent over-pressurization of the system.  The liquids storage tank is designed, installed, and operated per ASME code.  In the unlikely event of tank failure, dikes around the tank would contain the natural gas liquids. \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Tyler Gas Plant has never had an accident involving a regulated substance that caused deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or evacuations.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has a site-specific emergency response plan.  The plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of a regulated substance accidental release. Aspects of emergency response include adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notifications of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident cleanup of affected areas. A general emergency practice drill will be performed at least annually and will also include an invitation to the local authorities. Because the facility is normally unmanned, it is policy to notify the Dixie Volunteer Fire Department for response to an immediate emergency.  The emergency response plan contains procedures for notifying company staff and management for the sustained response.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThere wil"
