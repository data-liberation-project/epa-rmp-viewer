      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nAt the City of Starke Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) we store and use chlorine gas, which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Because our storage of chlorine exceeds the 2,500-pound threshold, we develop and implement a Risk Management Plan as required by the regulations under the EPA 40 CFT 68.  \n\nIt is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our employees, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of chlorine and to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on proper handling of chlorine, which requires proper training, combined with the safety devices installed in the system.\n\nOur Emergency Response Program is based on the plan developed by the District 3 Local Emergency Planning council.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and evacuation routes.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility, chlorine gas.  Chlorine gas is used in the final stage of the wastewater treatment process to disinfect the effluent.  The gas is stored in one-ton cylinders.  At this time, the maximum inventory of chlorine gas at our facility is 2 one-ton cylinders, for a total of 4,000 pounds.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps:\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This plant was designed and constructed in accordance with all relevant standards including:  Technical Bulletin ? Design Criteria for Mechanical, Electrical, and Fluid Systems and Component Reliability ? Supplement to Federal Guideli"

The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and evacuation routes.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nCurrently there are no planned changes for the chlorine storage and handling at this facility.  We will continue to monitor and inspect all aspects of chlorine use to determine if any changes would improve safety."
