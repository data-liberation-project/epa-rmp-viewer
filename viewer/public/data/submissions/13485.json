The Yowlumne Station is a Liquefied Petroleum Gasoline (LPG) / crude oil blending and transfer facility.  The process is regulated by Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189.  The facility is currently implementing a prevention program described below.\n\nEOTT Energy has a commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of covered processes.  EOTT Energy's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nThe prevention program is based on 40 CFR Part 68 and Title 19 CCR 2735.  The program includes the following areas: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.  Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the process safety management audits and revalidation of the process hazard analysis.  Training includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, emergency response, hotwork permit procedure, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures.\n\nThe facility stores and unloads natural gasoline.  There are 2 tanks with a capacity of 18,250 gallons.  The tanks are administratively controlled to hold liquified petroleum gasoline at 90% maximum capacity"

      "SummaryText": "; therefore the worst case flammable scenario is based on a 16, 430 gallon release.\n\nEOTT Energy maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The Yowlumne Station has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release.  This information was verified by the reviewing of records from the Kern County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on the Environmental Protection Agency Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance equations and model.  The worst case scenario and alternate release scenario were based on n-butane as the modeled substance.  The facility stores and transfers primarily natural gasoline, of which n-butane is a component.  The worst case release of 82,200 lbs of liquefied gasoline indicates a 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.35 miles. This distance impacts public receptors of an adjacent farm.  In addition, although there are numerous controls in place, no credit was taken into account for evaluating the worst case scenario.  The Alternative Release Scenario for this process is a break in transfer hose connection.  This scenario could result in release of 60 lbs of liquids over a 10 minute period. The maximum distance for this scenario is 0.03 miles.  The process maintains mitigation measures such as relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.
