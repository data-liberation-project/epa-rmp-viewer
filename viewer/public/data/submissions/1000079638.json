The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Technology Park, and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations (WVO).  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nWVO is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also an active member of the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe New Yard is used to temporarily store rail cars for eventual processing at the Institute site. The rail yard is managed by West Virginia Operations Site Logistics, but is not considered contiguous with the Institute site. No chemical loading or unloading takes place at the New Yard.\r\n\r\nThere is currently one RMP regulated substances present in one covered process at the facility. Isopentane is no longer transported via rail car, and therefore has been removed from the list of RMP regulated substances at New Yard.  UCC stores a threshold quantity of one EPA regulated toxic substance in the New Yard:\r\n\u00bf\tEthylene Oxide\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory quantity of ethylene oxide has increased for the 2014 RMP resubmittal due to a revision in estimation methods associated in an increase in average capaci"

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nUCC's general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA's PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System and standards. Key elements include:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nWe maintain detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters\r\nand equipment designs associated with all covered processes. Examples include, but are not limited to, Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, equipment design specification sheets, and reactive chemicals test results. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses may include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined), Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP's), Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, WVO maintains written opera"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nWVO has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes\r\nare competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided\r\non a continuing basis.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nWVO carries out a documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on\r\nprocess equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but\r\nis not limited to: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\r\nshutdown systems, controls, pumps, and compressors. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified\r\npersonnel with training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized\r\ntraining as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe\r\nand timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWVO facilities require management of modifications to process equipment, procedures, raw materials, and\r\nprocessing conditions other than \"like for like\", by identifying, documenting, and reviewing them prior to\r\nimplementation of changes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job\r\ntasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training\r\nprior to the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are\r\nconducted at WVO.

Audits are conducted using established schedules and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nWVO promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nWVO believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. UCC employees and\r\ncontracted employees working in UCC Institute plants are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees and contracted employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nWVO hires contractors to perform some specialized operations, maintenance and construction activities.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post- incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.
