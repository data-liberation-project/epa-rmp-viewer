      "SummaryText": "Farming is by far the No.1 industry in Barton County generating millions of dollars to the local economy annually. Crop production is the central fucus of most of the farmers in the area. We at Rice's Feed Service provide a wide variety of products and services to our farmer customers in an effort to help them remain profitable and productive. Anhydrous Ammonia is one of the products that helps us accomplish this. Its use as a crop nutrient is unique as it can be applied much earlier in the season when the soil is cooler with no possibility of loss by volitization into the atmosphere, thereby allowing the grower to spread his workload over a longer period of time. It is also the most economical nitrogen source available, generally running 50-60 % less than most other nitrogen fertilizers. Anhydrous Ammonia can and is also used as a means of improving the proein and feed value of hay that is very important to the livestock industry in our area. This process involves stacking and coveringthe hay with plastic, sealing the bottom edges with lime and introducing the ammonia into the stack and allowing it to be absorbed by the hay. This is especially beneficial with poorer quality fescue hay which is the main source of forage in our area. We at Rice's Feed Service have installed our storage tank according to the specifications determined by the authorities in our state, useing a system of backflow and excess flow valves along with breakaway safety hoses in order to prevent accidental releases as much as possible. We do not own a fleet of nurse tanks of our own, requiring that any grower who desires to use this product own , maintain and store his own equipment. However,we do keep an inventory of valves,hoses, gaskets, etc. and insist that all tanks be in good operating condition before filling. We have an ongoing training program for our employees in order to protect them as well as our neighbors from injury resulting from an accidental release. We have coordinated with t"

      "SummaryText": "he LEPC of our county in conjunction with the local fire dept. and ambulance service as to the proper procedures for handling an accidental release or the treatment of injuries which could result. An experience with a release that is reported in this RMP was a tremendous learning situation that has resulted in several changes on site with regards to proper safety equipment and the location of this equipment so that it is available in case of an emergency. We have stepped up our training program in house as well as with our local LEPC. This release was the result of a broken valve caused by thieves attempting to steal ammonia in order to produce methamphetimines. This is without a doubt the biggest challenge we face today as far as reducing the potential for an accidental release. We have been cooperating with law enforcement officials to help reduce the potential for theft by allowing video camera to be set up,installing better lighting around the facility, installing an improved locking system around valves that we believe is relatively foolproof, but even though these things have reduced the theft by a great deal, they are not perfect and it seems that these people are willing to do whatever is necessary to get their hands on this product. Our facility, although in an urban setting,is located on the very Northeast edge of our city, away from the main business and residential districts and the prevailing winds would normaly take a cloud away from the city.  In summary, we are trying in many ways to provide a safe envionment and be a good neighbor to our community while providing a valuable product and service to the most important industry in our county. We believe that an honest and open approach along with communication and cooperation with all of the members of our city and with the local LEPC's, fire dept. ambulance service and law enforcement officials in conjunction with a continuing safety program will provide for a safe enviornment for all of us to live in"
