Clarks Grove Fertilizer LLC is NOT involved in the conversion process.  This contractor has provided the LLC with documentation to support a mechanical integrity program is in place along with written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan, and a training program for the conversion process.  Additionally, the LLC has their own Emergency Action Plan, Incident Response Plan and other safety procedures and policies in place, including those required by the EPA under this Program.  The involved contractor reports that the following safeties to the process are in place:  \n\nAn audible and visual alarm system, which will warn if the pump or cooling tower fan malfunctions.  Fisher N-550 Emergency Shut-off Valves are installed at discharge of source and at the ammonia pump, and pneumatically held open during use, and they are capable of remote closure.  The ammonia hose used between source and pump, as well as that used for bypass, is FMH-22 double-braided, corrugated 316L SS to avoid potential rupture between these critical connections.  A standard Fisher ammonia regulator is used at the pump, pressure controlled, to bypass any excess ammonia to the suction side of the pump.  A standard ammonia backcheck valve is used on the input line at the Mix Unit.  Pressure relief valves for the ammonia system are recertified annually by an outside vendor.  These added safeties have proven effective in avoiding potential releases as evidenced by the Contractor?s safety record.  \n\n",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\n\n\nManagement and employees of Clarks Grove Fertilizer LLC, Clarks Grove, MN location (hereinafter LLC), are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n\n\nThe LLC periodically retains an OUTSIDE contractor who utilizes a mobile unit for the production of ammoniated polyphosphate liquids.  The LLC is neither involved in the conversion process, nor does the LLC own the conversion equipment.  \n\nThe liquid fertilizer grade produced during the conversion process is 10-34-00.  Raw materials used in the conversion process include anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water. The anhydrous ammonia used in the conversion process is brought onto the facility in a semi transport. The anhydrous ammonia is on site temporarily.  The anhydrous ammonia is never off-loaded into a permanent storage container at the LLC.  Rather, it is transferred from the semi-transport to the contractor's process equipment where the conversion takes place immediately.  Therefore, this RMP is being filed as a Predictive Filing.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture Administrative Rules, and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. LLC employees are not involved with the conversion process-the contractor utilizes their own employees.   \n\nThis contractor has provided the LLC with documentation to support a mechanical integrity program is in place along with written operating procedures"

The Five-year Accident History:  \n\nNone-There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at the facility.  \n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe LLC has:\n\na. A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38. The plan includes a specific section on NH3 Releases and what to do in the event of a release. The EAP plan was last reviewed in July 2012.  Additionally, an Incident Response Plan (per Minnesota Department of Agricultural requirements) was finalized and in place as of August 2012.   In the event of an accidental release during the conversion process, the LLC employees understand they must only call 911; and follow all established evacuation and emergency procedures set forth in their EAP and IRP.  \n\nLLC employees received training in Spring 2012.  The facility's manager received training in September 2012 (two separate training sessions on 9/13/12).\n\nThe LLC has an AWAIR program in place and is committed to a safe working environment.\n\n\n\nThe Conversion Contractor has:\n\nProvided the LLC with multiple documents confirming they meet the requirements of the fourteen (14) elements under 29 CFR Part 1910 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and 40 CFR Part 68, Section 112, as well as EPA's Risk Management Plan.  Their portable or mobile mix unit carries a PSM/RMP manual and it would be on site at all times during the conversion process.  They have a company Emergency Action Plan and a Field Emergency Procedure/Plan.  \n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Currently, there are\n\nno additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation.  The LLC has been provided with documentation from the contractor which confirms they last reviewed their procedures in September 2012. \n\n"
