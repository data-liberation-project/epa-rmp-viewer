      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water. The LADWP Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004, and June 2009.  This RMP is the five-year update of the June 2009 RMP.  The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs in 1999 and 2004 because Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station was not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  However, construction projects related to the Tujunga Wells facility resulted in the LADWP employees working more frequently on the property. The construction activities are temporary in nature and do not involve the chlorination station's operations, but staff has been assigned to work in portable buildings, which are located near the chlorination station.

The facility is located approximately one-quarter mile east of the Hollywood Freeway (State 170) and immediately south of the Tujunga Wash River. This facility is a groundwater well field and pumping station complex.  The facility injects chlorine into a collector pipeline before entering or after leaving a 3-million gallon water contact tank.  The station consists of a chlorine storage room, a chlorination room, a chlorine control room, a tool room, a dry media chlorine scrubber (main scrubber), and a dry media chlorine mini-scrubber.  The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and the CalARP Program rules.  A maximum of nine one-ton chlorine containers can be stored at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station.  Six of these containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas and the other three containers are stored as spares.  The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) online. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.

These six containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and will close the valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room. The facility has two additional ton containers that rest on load cells. However, a maximum of only four ton containers with Halogen actuators are used for chlorination at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station. All of these six ton containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight in the containers.  There are trunnions for storage of three additional full or empty ton containers without process connections.\n\n \n\nChlorine gas is withdrawn from a bank of containers through pigtails, which are attached to the ton container gas valves.  The chlorine flows under pressure to a chlorine header then to the automatic switchover vacuum regulating valves with check-relief unit.  The switchover valves are triggered by the rise in vacuum pressure in the chlorine feed line between the switchover valve and the chlorinator.  The rise in vacuum occurs when the chlorine container pressure approaches zero, which happens when the container is empty.  If this occurs, the switchover valve will open the alternate chlorine connection, demanding chlorine gas from the alternate chlorine containers.  The chlorine gas then leaves the switchover valve under vacuum to the chlorinators in the adjacent room.  From the chlorinators, the gaseous chlorine then travels under vacuum to three chlorine injectors in a cabinet located adjacent to an underground vault outside the station.  At the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high-pressure water supply to form a chlorine solution, which then travels to diffuser tubes located in the pipelines.

      "SummaryText": "o review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA PHA was performed in August 2012 to evaluate the change from a caustic soda based wet chorine scrubber at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station to a dry media chlorine scrubber.  A number of recommendations were made to further improve chlorine safety based on the 2012 PHA. All of these recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the LADWP. The dry media main chlorine scrubber has been installed and it is now in operation. A dry media chlorine mini-scrubber has also been installed at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station and it is now in operation. Additionally, five recommendations to further improve chlorine safety were identified in February 2014, when the PHA was reviewed for the facility. Based on the 2014 seismic assessment, two recommendations were also made to improve chlorine safety. It is expected that all the recommendations will be evaluated by December 2014 and implemented by June 2015. The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorine system.\n\n"
