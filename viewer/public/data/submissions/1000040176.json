      "SummaryText": "White River Municipal Water District (MWD) operates a Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located at 2880 FM 2794, in Crosby County, Texas near Spur.  The WTP provides potable water to the cities of Crosbyton, Post, Ralls, and Spur, as well as to Rio Blanco Estates subdivision. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the White River MWD WTP.  Up to 8,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the White River MWD WTP. Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity (?68.130; Table 1), White River MWD developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The White River MWD WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the White River MWD Plant Superintendent is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the White River MWD will periodically perform comp"

These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58).\n\n\n\nThe White River MWD WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The White River MWD WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response. The White River MWD WTP is included in the Crosby County Local Emergency Planning Committee's (LEPC) regional Emergency Response Plan.  WTP operators are trained to contact the City of Crosbyton Fire Department Chemical Hazard Team via 911 in the event of a release.  The City of Crosbyton Fire Department Chemical Hazard Team will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the regional Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (?68.155(e)). \n\n"
