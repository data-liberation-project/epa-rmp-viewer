The program includes engineering, education, and enforcement provisions for hazard communication, spill prevention and response, hazardous waste, universal waste and used oil management, waste water and storm water management.\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Program: OMP facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response plan. The emergency response plan contains detailed procedures for: 1) pre-emergency planning and coordination; 2) personnel roles and lines of authority; 3) training; 4) communication; 5) emergency recognition and prevention; 6) safe distances and places of refuge; 7) site security and control; 8) emergency alerting and response; 9) ammonia decontamination; 10) emergency medical treatment and first aid; 11) critique of response and follow-up; 12) personal protective and emergency equipment; and 13) medical surveillance.\n\n\n\nOMP emergency response plan is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.  All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Batesville Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.   The Batesville Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance: OMP is a Poultry processing plant located at 1810 South St. Louis Street, Batesville, Arkansas. The main building houses a processing plant used for evisceration, processing and packaging. The processed products require refrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is the pri"

The North Engine Room is located in the northeast area of the building. The South Engine Room is located in the south-central area of the building.\n\n\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the process.  The Worst Case Scenario circle of impact for the South Engine Room encompassed the circle of impact for the North Engine Room.  Therefore, the Worst Case Scenario for the South engine Room was utilized.  Two Alternate Case Scenarios were entered since circle of impact is different for each scenario.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents or accidents during the past five years.  However, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, lists of action items were developed.  The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished.  Monthly safety training is conducted for all team members at this facility. In addition PSM meetings are held to review safety and PSM program elements.  Refer to Process Safety Management Program for specific information."
