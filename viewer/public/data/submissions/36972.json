The goal of this policy is to provide safe working conditions for employees as well as protect the public and the environment.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n      The subject source is the Tar River Water Treatment Plant Plant located on Leaston Road in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.  The facility is a 12 MGD water treatment facility consisting of flocculation, clarification, and filtration processes supplying potable water to citizens of Rocky Mount.\n   \nThe process at the water treatment plant subject to the RMP regulations is the chlorination system, which manages greater than threshold quantities of chlorine.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s) and associated offsite consequence analysis are not described here in detail for reasons of confidentiality, per EPA guidance.\n\n             The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n        The accidental release prevention program at the Tar River Water Treatment Plant is focused on the safe management of chlorine used in the chlorination system.  The first step in the prevention program at the Plant was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility for the individual program elements. Additional steps include: ensuring process safety information on the disinfection system is accurate, complete and up-to-date; ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating a"

In addition, the Plant has in place an emergency action plan than includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.  The procedures cover the following: emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; emergency reporting; evacuation plan; first aid procedures; notifying local emergency response agencies and the public; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities; emergency alarm system; training and drills; and pre-emergency planning."
