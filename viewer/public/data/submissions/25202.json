Applicable procedures of the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed . The facility emergency\npolicy involves the preparation of plans tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services\navailable in the community.\n\nThe spill prevention policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of\nregulated flammable substances. In the event such a release occurs personnel are prepared to work\nwith the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control\nand mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nHANDLED\n\nThe Greasewood Quick Cycle Gas Plant, a remote unattended facility, located in rural Rio Blanco\nCounty, Colorado, recovers petroleum products ( e.g. natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) from\nfield gas. The NGL separated from the field gas is stored on site and is sold to others for further\nprocessing. NGL is a flammable mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including regulated\nflammables methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, isopentane and pentane. There are no\nthreshold toxic substances present. \n\nWORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worse case scenario (WCS) at this Program 2 stationary source is the release of the maximum\ncontent of the storage tank, which forms a flammable vapor cloud and the cloud detonates. For\nflammable substances the end point is an overpressure of 1 psi. The endpoint distance, determined by\nEPA's RMP Comp., indicates that this facility has public receptors. No credit for mitigating measures\nwere taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternate release scenario (ARS) is failure of a 2 inch steel pipe connecting to the NGL storage\ntank with the release resultin"

This stationary source was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state\nand federal regulations and applicable good engineering practices. The following briefly describes the\nrelease prevention program. \n\nSafety Information \n\nA variety of documents are available and used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These\ndocuments cover chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and\nspecific chemical inventories, equipment specification and design basis/ configuration information. This\ninformation is updated when a change occurs that makes the information inaccurate. \n\nChemical specific information describing the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances is\nmaintained e.g. material safety data sheets. For specific process areas, safety related limits for specific\nprocess parameters  (e.g. temperature, pressure, level) are documented. Process controls and\nmonitoring instruments, protective instrument systems and trained personnel are used to maintain the\nprocess within these limits.\n\nInformation about the design and construction of the process equipment is maintained and readily\navailable. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well\nas evaluating proposed changes to make sure that process safety features are not compromised.\n\nHazard Review\n\nHazard reviews are conducted to identify and control hazards associated with the process and\nregulated substances including the potential for equipment or human error; and the safeguards needed\nto detect, control or prevent hazards, equipment malfunction and human error.  Applicable standards,\nrules and good engineering practices are utilized in the review process. The m"

Hazard analysis findings are addressed in a timely manner. Findings and final\nresolutions are documented and maintained. Additional reviews/ inspections include pre startup for\nnew/ modified process or equipment and periodic equipment inspections.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures for safely conducting activities associated with regulated substances have\nbeen prepared and are maintained at the facility.   These procedures address various modes of\noperation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations,\nnormal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown. The operating procedures can be used as a\nreference by experienced employees and serve as a basis for consistent training of new personnel. The\nprocedures are readily accessible to employees; and are reviewed as needed and updated if necessary.\n\nTraining\n\nA training program is in place to train employees involved in process operations. New employees\nreceive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are\ndetermined to be competent to work independently.  Training on new and updated procedures is\nprovided before startup after a major change. Refresher training is provided at least ever 3 years or\nmore frequently if needed or requested.  In addition, employees not operating the process receive\nsafety training on the hazards associated with the process and regulated substances at the facility. \n\nMaintenance\n\nMaintenance checks/ inspections are performed on the facility equipment to ensure proper function.\nMaintenance, tests and inspections are consistent with applicable manufacturers' recommendations,\ngood practices and prior operating experience.
