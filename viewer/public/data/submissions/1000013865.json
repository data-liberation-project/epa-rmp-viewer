(EPA)) The facility is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facilityA?s staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia for NOX Reduction.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\nCalPine - Pastoria Energy Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Selective Catalytic Reduction System.  CalPine - Pastoria Energy FacilityA?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe facility utilizes ammonia for their Selective Catalytic Reduction System to control nitrous oxide emissions.  264,000 pounds of ammonia are contained in the two Ammonia Storage Tanks if the tanks are kept at maximum capacity.      \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined for the process.  The results can be found in the HAZARD ASSESSMENT Tab located in the RMP Compliance Workbook.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A realistic alternative release scenario was defined for the process.  The results can be found in the HAZARD ASSESSMENT Tab located in the RMP Compliance Workbook.\n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks; CalPine - Pastoria Energy Facility has rec"

In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\nA?    There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\nA?    The system undergoes scheduled maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\nA?    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by facility personnel, as necessary.\nThe history of CalPine - Pastoria Energy Facility (i.e., no RMP -applicable ammonia releases in the last five years) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Selective Catalytic Reduction System. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of the implementation of RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by CalPine - Pastoria Energy Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia. Prevention Program 3 elements are listed in the following table:\n\nCompliance Workbook Tab\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nOperating Procedures (OP)\nTraining (TRN)\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\nManagement of Change (MOC)\nPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\nCompliance Audits (CA)\nIncident Investigation (II)\nEmployee Participation (EP"
