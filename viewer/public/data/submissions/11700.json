Bil Mar operations include slaughtering, de-boning, and some processing.  Bil Mar has been in operation at this facility for over 41 years providing quality meat products and over 500 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nBil Mar Foods is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. It is Bil Mar's policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and, as applicable, Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nBil Mar Foods is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products. Bil Mar Foods also operates freezers and coolers for product storage. Bil Mar uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 113,640 ft2 facility within the required range of operating temperatures and to operate the freezers and coolers. Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants. Bil Mar's refrigeration system consists of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping.  \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Sub"

      "SummaryText": "part B, Bil Mar has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel over a 10-minute period.  Based on Bil Mar's refrigeration system, the worst-case release scenario is the rupture of the high pressure receiver (2,468 gallon vessel) when filled to 80% capacity.  Using EPA's RMP*Comp 1.06 version, it was determined that the ammonia release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public / environmental receptors. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered by Bil Mar to be a likely release scenario for the facility. During normal operations, Bil Mar maintains the receiver at no more than 50% capacity. Only during pump-down operations does the receiver have the potential to be filled to 80% of capacity. The receiver is operated in pump-down mode less than 1% of the time during the year.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Bil Mar Foods taking into consideration the 5-year history of operation's experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses conducted to ensure that Bil Mar's hazards are identified and minimized. These analyses were conducted in accordance to Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119). In accordance with 40 CFR 68.28, alternative release scenarios were considered, that would be more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenarios.  \n\nAfter reviewing the process hazard analysis performed on the system, the most likely anhydrous ammonia release could occur from a damaged ammonia pipe. Using EPA's RMP*Comp 1.06 version, it was determined that the ammonia release would reach offsite endpoints "

In addition, Bil Mar's ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with accepted industry standards and good engineering practices. \n\nBil Mar has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic level controls and electric distribution system grounding).  In addition, Bil Mar has trained approximately 40 personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat team).\n\nBil Mar has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an annual basis. Bil Mar encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Bil Mar, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\nBil Mar understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Bil Mar has implemented a preventative maintenance program.

Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Bil Mar as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n \n Bil Mar has trained approximately 40 on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases.
