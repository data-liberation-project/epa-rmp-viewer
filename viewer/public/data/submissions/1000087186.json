      "SummaryText": "Golden Gate / SET Petroleum Partners of Nevada\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\n=========================================================================================\n\n\n\nGolden Gate / SET Petroleum Partners of Nevada (GGP) operates as a natural gas liquids fractionation plant, which processes natural gas liquids that are trucked into the facility by independent trucking firms.  The NGLs are unloaded into storage tanks prior to being processed.  Once the product is introduced into the fractionization system, certain chemicals, known as \"light ends\" are removed from the NGLs.  Those chemicals include ethane, used as plant fuel-gas, as well as propane and butane, which are sold commercially.  \n\n\n\nOnce the light ends are removed from the NGLs, the remaining liquid is termed natural gasoline.  The natural gasoline is a low octane fuel that is transported to a gasoline blending facility and used as a blend stock for producing no-lead gasoline.\n\n\n\nRisk to the public from the GGP facility is extremely low, primarily due to the location of the plant.  The plant is situated approximately 1.7 miles from any family dwelling and about 5 miles from the nearest town. In the event of a release or a fire, the people most likely to be effected would be GGP employees.  In the event of a large chemical release or fire, employees are trained to shutdown the plant if practical, notify other persons in the area (i.e. truck drivers, contract employees)and leave the plant to go to the predetermined rally point. \n\n\n\nGGP employs excellent methods to minimize risk at its facility.  The GGP facility uses a Leak Detection And Repair (LDAR) plan to conduct quarterly inspections of all potential leaking VOC sources. The inspection is conducted using a calibrated handheld flame-ionization detector which is capable of detecting leaks from 1 to 10,000+ parts-per-million.  Equipment tested includes all potential fugitive emission sources, such as tanks, pumps, valves, compressors, emergency relief valves an"

      "SummaryText": "d connectors. \n\n\n\nThere are over 2,000 potential emission points checked during a typical inspection.  When a leak is discovered, a work order is written up and the first attempt of repair occurs within 48 hours. Leaks at the facility are minimal.\n\n\n\nThe results from testing are reported to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, who administers the program for the EPA.\n\n\n\nAs part of the facility's SPCC plan, in compliance with 40 CFR Part 112, a visual inspection of tanks, and other items, occurs monthly and annually. In addition to the SPCC requirements a weekly inspection also occurs.  The \"tank\" section of the inspection form requires observation for:\n\n\n\n-    Signs of leakage,\n\n-    Signs of corrosion,\n\n-    Seam damage,\n\n-    Condition of tank foundation, and,\n\n-    Flange leakage.\n\n\n\nPiping is also visually observed on a weekly basis.\n\n\n\nAny problems that are discovered are quickly resolved.  \n\n\n\nVarious tanks and facility piping is tested by a certified Non-Destructive Testing Level III Technician.  The last such inspection occurred on September 27, 2019.\n\n\n\nTo minimize the possibility of accidents at our facility, all operations employees are trained on all operational procedures, including emergency procedures. \n\n\n\nGGP has a commitment to safety. No one is more concerned about the safety of the plant; its employees and the surrounding community than GGP.  Our intention is to remain vigilant because of the hazardous nature of our business and do all that is possible to operate in a safe and environmentally sound manner."
