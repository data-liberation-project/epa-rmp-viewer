      "SummaryText": "The receipt, storage and conveyance of anhydrous ammonia is the single highly hazardous process present at the Santee Cooper WGS facility.  This determination is based upon federal and state process safety management (PSM) regulations and Santee Cooper standards.  This process (receipt, storage, and conveyance) is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three program levels (1,2, & 3) of requirements.  Program Level 1 is applicable to a process for which it can be demonstrated that no public receptors (e.g., residence, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals) would be affected by a worst-case release.  A covered process is subject to Program 2 requirements if it does not meet the eligibility requirements of either Program 1 or 3.  Therefore, Santee Cooper's worst-case scenario identifies public receptors that would be affected.  40 CFR Part 68 identifies that the processes at the Santee Cooper WGS facility are subject to Program 3 requirements.  The Santee Cooper Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with the Level 3 RMP Program requirements for this facility under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nFor the 2019 RMP update, a more conservative modeling approach was adopted - i.e., the use of Reference Table #9 for worst case scenarios and Reference Table #22 for alternative case scenarios from EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (EPA 550-B-99-009) versus the PHAST modeling. Although the result is a broader distance to endpoint, it is considered reasonable given the hazard classification of anhydrous ammonia and the onsite quantity stored. Note: For the worst case scenario, the determination of the distance to endpoint was interpolated between entries in the reference table as discussed on p. 4-1 of the guidance document.\n\n\n\nAdditional Emergency Con"
