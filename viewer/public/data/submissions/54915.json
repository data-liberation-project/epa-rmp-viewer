      "SummaryText": "Giant Resource Recovery - Attalla, Inc. owns and operates a treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF) for fuels blending and solids consolidation, primarily for energy recovery and incineration.  Waste material is generally received and shipped by the facility via truck and railcar.\n\n(a) The facility is committed to the safety of it's employees and neighboring community.  Facility personnel receive training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response as provided in the facility's RCRA permit.  Topics discussed to prevent hazards include: site access, inspections, location and operation of emergency response equipment, utilization of existing safety measure (e.g., berms, containment), and the handling of incompatible wastes.  Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and spills; the Reece City Volunteer Fire Department is the primary responder in the event of a release beyond the incipient stage.  \n\n(b) The facility consists of a fuels blending operation (liquids and solids) and a drum tipping operation.  The liquid fuels blending operation consists of eight 20,000 gallon storage tanks, and is interconnected with piping to the drum tipping operation.  The regulated substances handled above their regulated threshold levels include:  Acrylonitrile; Allyl Alcohol; Carbon Disulfide; Chloroform; and Vinyl Acetate Monomer.\n\nc) The facility has an established Level 2 Prevention Program.  Also, as part of the facility's RCRA permit, the facility provides regular employee training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response.  Additionally, the facility attempts to actively manage the processing of RMP chemicals such that these chemicals are maintained below the RMP thresholds.\n\n(d) The facility has not experienced a reportable incident under the criteria established during the past five years.\n\n(e) Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and releases.  Emergency response/contingency plan training includes:  no"

      "SummaryText": "tification of appropriate personnel (company and off-site responder); hazardous material identification; release assessment; control procedures; prevention of recurrence or spread of fires/releases; and incident clean-up.  The facility maintains emergency equipment to use in the event or a fire or release (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), spill control equipment).  The Reece City Volunteer Fire Department, Etowah County Sheriff's Department, and Baptist Memorial Hospital are part of the emergency response plans for the facility and have been provided copies of the facility's contingency plan.\n\n(f) The facility provides refresher employee training regularly that incorporates safe handling practices, hazard prevention, and emergency response.  The facility also performs monthly safety meetings on various topics taken from suggestions provided by facility employees.  With respect to RMP chemical handling, the facility attempts to actively manage the processing of these chemicals such that the volume of the chemicals is below the RMP threshold quantities.  In the event that the facility receives the chemicals listed above in quantities greater than the RMP thresholds, the facility attempts to manage the chemicals such that the volume of the chemicals is reduced and removed from the site expeditiously.\n\n(g) In August 2005 the facility determined that acrylonitrile may be managed, at a higher concentration than included in the facility's original RMP (increased from 5% to 40%).  However, this increase applies to the liquid storage tanks only and, as such, the maximum anticipated concentration of acrylonitrile at the rail facility will remain 5%.  An offsite consequence analysis for the increased acrylonitrile concentration tank storage scenario was performed to determine it represented the worst case toxic release scenario.  The worst case release scenario remained the carbon disulfide release scenario from the rail-car process."
