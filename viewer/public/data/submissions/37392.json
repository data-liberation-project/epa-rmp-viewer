The protection of the environment and the control of environmental matters receive top priority, support, and participation by all employees.\n\n2.\tDescription of Stationary Source\n\nThe facility in Fort Meade uses anhydrous ammonia in the production of granular monoammonium phosphate (GMAP).  The GMAP process, which began operation in October 2000, includes a 175-ton `bullet\u00bf of anhydrous ammonia adminstratively controlled to 140 tons.  The PSM covered portion of this process begins at the unloading manifold and ends at the GMAP reactor and granulator.  The plant has the infrastructure to produce powdered MAP but this process is currently not in operation.  The Ft. Meade Chemical Plant manufactures phosphoric acid onsite to be used in the GMAP process.  It is used as a main ingredient to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer.  Ammonia is received by truck and is stored in a vessel called a bullet.  Ammonia is combined with phosphoric acid to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer.\n\n3.\tPrevention Program\n\nThe accidental release prevention program includes:\n- a requirement to ensure covered process equipment is properly designed with emergency shutoff;\n- training of maintenance personnel and testing of critical covered process equipment;\n- written operating procedures and training of operators; and\n- safety inspections, reviews, and audits of covered process equipment.\n\n4.\tAccident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n5.\tEmergency Response \n\nThe emergency response program includes:\n - a written emergency response plan;\n - joint emergency response exercises conducted with community responders; and\n - appropriate emergency response equipment.\n\nThe emergency response policy is stated as follows:\nU.
