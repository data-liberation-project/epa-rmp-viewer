Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store fluid milk, ice cream,  and related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 14,600 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high stage accumulator that operates at approximately 25 psig and can contain as much as 16,600 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 80%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains only 4,200 pounds of ammonia.  In addition, the current total capacity of the ammonia system is only 14,600 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, ice chiller, silos, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\n\n\n1.2        PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Fayetteville plant  is a single-stage flooded system consisting of a discharge (high pressure) side and a suction side.  \n\nThe compressors draw suction from the high side suction accumulator at about 25 psig.  This accumulator receives suction "

Ammonia liquid which collects in the high side accumulator is transferred to the system by turbine pumps.\n\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas), at 150 to 175 psig,  enters two roof-mounted condensers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting of load units. \n\nThe condensed liquid is transferred to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the refrigeration equipment, via the accumulator.\n\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.   These include pressure relief valves, engine room ventilation, and safety interlocks.  \n\nPressure relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, and suction accumulators from overpressurization.\n\nSafety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cut outs for the compressors as well as high level floats and sensors for the vessels.  The high pressure cut-outs for the compressors are set at 225 psig. The system also includes a solenoid-operated liquid (\"King\") valve which is controlled and shut down from the accumulator controls. A system high pressure alarm also turns off all compressors when the high side pressure exceeds 190 psig.\n\nThe accumulator has both high liquid level and low liquid level shut down switches.  The high level switch activates a slave relay that shuts down the compressors.  The low level switch activates a slave relay that shuts down both the compressors and the liquid pumps.  The liquid pumps are equipped with high temperature shut-offs.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, suction accumulators, receiver, and chillers from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and hi"

The high pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n\n\n2.0        POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or represent an off-site impact.\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative release) were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the ammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  This endpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (the \"Model Plan\"), dated November 1998.  This guidance document used the SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct \"lookup\" tables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the endpoint distance.\n\n\n2.1        WORST-CASE RELEASE\n\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the maximum contents of the high accumulator (approximately 14,600 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was estimated to be 7,400  feet or 1.4 mile.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required "

      "SummaryText": "by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the accumulator is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The vessel was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs annually by a boiler and machinery insurance inspector who has been certified by the National Board.  In addition, the vessel is visually inspected daily.\n\nThere are only two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment of the accumulator:  (1) the internal pressure were to increase uncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside; or (2) rupture of the vessel wall due to inadvertent contact (e.g., vehicular) from the outside.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) of 150 psig and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately 600 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  Such pressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external cause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface radiation from a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessel.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to relieve internal pressure at 150 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRVs continued to function.  Actuation of the SRV would result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative release scenario.  A plan is being devised whereby the SRVs will be replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, M"

This release is representative of a small pipe or vessel leak.  It would also be representative of a flange leak or pump seal  failure.  Because the high pressure receiver and some piping are located outdoors, passive (building) mitigation1 was not used to reduce the release rate or the distance to the endpoint.  Active mitigation2 was considered, because it is believed that emergency responders could identify and stop the leak in less than 60 minutes.  However, reducing the release duration does not change the TEP distance obtained from the Model plan.  "
