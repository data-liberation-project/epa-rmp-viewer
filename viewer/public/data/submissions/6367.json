This requires that 1 ton chlorine containers be kept for use and supply at a maximum.  The system will have one container in use at a time with one or two in reserve.\n\nThe City has taken great effort in improvements to emergency preparedness through its local, county and state agencies.  This is presently being done by a complete reorganization of this within the last year.  The revisions of its plan and now implementation of this into next year's revised plan.  The water and wastewater facilities have emergency operations and chlorine handling procedural manuals in place.  The contracted operator keeps updates and reviews the operations with them on this.\n\nThe first priority of the City is to provide a safe work place and safe conditions for the environment.  This is one reason the new plant was located approximately 3/4 mile east of town from its location downtown.\n\nOverview of the Facility:  The water treatment plant is a new facility located approximately 3/4 east of town in a rural area.  The plant is a 2 Mgd pulsating clarifying plant whose construction was completed in early 1998.  It is a concrete and block construction.  It was constructed so that all chemical operations such as chlorine is separated from the plant operation by separated rooms with accesses outside the central plant operation.  Containment of a release could be held until adequate response is made to a minimum chemicals of released.  Equipment to alert operators of a release were also incorporated into the design.  As well, manual shut down of equipment is done at the end of each daily shift.\n\nWorst Case Release:  The worst case of a release of chlorine gas from the City's water treatment plant would be that if a 2000 lb."

The contaminated area would be approximately .9 mile radius from ground zero.  On a USGS map the area noted indicates the zone affected as highlighted in the circle are also the residences affected.  There are approximately 41 residences then multiplied by 2.5 for the average number of persons per residence.  The population affected zone would be 103 people.\n\nAlternative Release:  This would be a leak of chlorine gas that would be at a rate of 1.05 pounds per second for 45 minutes that escaped from the chemical room to the outside area.  The contamination zone would be .1 mile.  This area has four residences located in it at an average of 2.5 people per residence or 10 people for this area.\n\nThe City will be evaluating different mitigation systems to prevent or contain the worst case scenario from occurring.  Presently the plan has alarms to warn of early leak detection.  The tank's valves are also manually closed at night when system is not in operation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention:  The City and its contracted operators work with all regulations that require compliance with OSHA, DNR, and EPA.  The system has a gas detection unit installed for early detection of the chlorine gas.  The controls for safety are outlined in various manuals which every operator is made aware of for the transfer of gas from container to the plant system. They are as follows:  Instruction Manual for Chlorinator, Chemical Feeding Equipment, Gas Detection Equipment, Material Safety Data Sheets (PPG), Chlorine Emergency Plan, Plant Operating Plan.  These are a few of the standard operating practices in place for the plant operators.\n\nIf the emergency should occur then there are in place plans for the coordination and response to the problem.  The City has in place at the plant an Emergency Operations Plan.  There is also at the present "

All of these are to help improve the safety of the facility and area."
