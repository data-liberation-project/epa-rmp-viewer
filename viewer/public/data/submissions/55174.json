Sun World International is extremely diligent in the handling of anhydrous ammonia and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Sun World International staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia for industrial refrigeration.\nSun World International has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Sun World International?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of anhydrous ammonia. \nSun World International?s produce packing facility is located in Kern County, California, approximately 9 miles north of the City of Shafter and 20 miles northwest of the City of Bakersfield. The facility is adjacent to the State Route #99 Highway, less than one mile west of Route #99. The area around the facility is filled with fruit plantations. \nSun World International is owned by Black Diamond Capital Management, LLP, an investment company located in Greenwich, Connecticut. The facility processes agricultural products such as grapes, melons, citrus fruit, and peppers which are packed and stored in various temperature controlled environments throughout the plant utilizing an industrial anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.\nThe site is currently operated by Sun World International staff and is manned 24 hrs a day. The facility employs approximately 100 personnel.\nThe regulated substance managed at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia travels through a refrigeration loop, traveling through receivers, pumps, and air units to satisfy cooling load. "

Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the ammonia refrigeration system.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab 2 of the CalARP Submittal Binder. Scenario Description: Two alternative release scenarios were modeled. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab 2 of the CalARP Submittal Binder. Although the use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Sun World International has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n    Automatic / Manual Shutdown\n    Well Designed Relief System\nThe history of the Sun World International facility (i.e., no CalARP-applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Refrigeration System.\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\nThe facility?s maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 44,000 lbs.  Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 lbs threshold quantity for EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities and over the 500 lbs state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.
