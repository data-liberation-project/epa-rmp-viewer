(Stoner) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Quarryville facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe facility receives and stores several flammable mixtures at the facility, including Dimethyl Ether (DME), 1,1-Difluoroethane (152a), and a mixture containing butane and propane (AB46), to be used for the manufacturing of various aerosol products. Covered process operations include unloading, storage, flammable material filling at the gas house and cylinder station, and final product packaging and shipment. The worst-case scenario and alternative scenarios were developed following the requirements of 40 CFR 68 Subpart B. \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nStoner has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nStoner maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What-if/Ch"

Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Stoner maintains detailed written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nStoner has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nStoner carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by personnel with previous training/experience in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at Stoner Quarryville to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nStoner conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nStoner promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nStoner believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, Stoner employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nStoner has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process. \n\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87] \nStoner occasionally hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis and the facility has a plan in place for evacuations, adequate first aid, and notification of local emergency response agencies. The facility is a non-responding facility and relies on the Quarryville Fire Company to respond to chemical releases.\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nIn an effort to continually improve the program, Stoner has developed a comprehensive PSM/RMP program and is in the process of reviewing and addressing recent PHA action items and implementing new PSM/RMP processes. Additionally, all process changes regarding the covered process are reviewed by the site management team prior to making any change. This provides expert review from each critical discipline, i.e. personnel safety, environmental, process safety, etc.\n\nStoner has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.  We believe that the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation, and our commitment to continuous improvement that an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."
