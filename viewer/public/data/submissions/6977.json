      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Town of Pulaski water treatment plant uses chlorine to disinfect its water supply.  The plant uses one-ton containers.  All are kept inside a chlorine building.  There are four to five containers stored with one being online and one on standby.  This building also contains various safety equipment, chlorinators, and spare parts.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first case is defined by EPA , which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released as a gas over ten minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nWorst-case scenario - Failure of 2000 lb. tank of chlorine, ten minutes, 200 lb./min. release using EPA calculations = 0.7 mile radius around chlorine building.\n\nAlternative scenario - Failure of regulator diaphragm, 2000 lb. tank of chlorine, 37.0 lb./min., 54 minute release using EPA calculation = 0.06 mile radius around chlorine building.\n\nAll containers are always kept within the enclosure.   A chlorine detector is located inside the chlorination room.  The alarm sends a signal to the computer's SCADA system.  The computer then calls out to notify personnel, after a set time period, if the alarm is not aknowledged at the plant.  \n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occured at this facility in the past five years.  \n\nThis facility has an emergency response program, which has been reviewed by the Pulaski County LEPC.  This program includes an evactuation plan.  Chemical specific prevention steps include the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and a Chlorine Institute emergency kit \"B\" for chlorine ton containers."
