However, several changes are captured in this update as follows.\n\na) 310 Block Operations:\n\n- Increase in chlorine inventory due to interconnectivity with other processes containing chlorine.  The 310 Block Operations does not have an inventory of chlorine above the Federal RMP threshold quantity (TQ) other than the connection.  But the interconnectivity results in chlorine present above TQ.  \n\n- The facility is already, and remains, a Program 3 stationary source with accident prevention programs in place. \n\nb) 520 Block Operations:\n\n- Reduction of anhydrous ammonia inventory below the Federal RMP TQ due to substantially smaller storage tank.\n\n- Reduction of chlorine inventory, which is still above the RMP TQ, due to storage tanks taken out of service.\n\n- Increase in anhydrous hydrogen chloride (aHCl) due to interconnectivy with other processes containing aHCl.  The 520 Block Operations does not have an inventory of aHCl above TQ other than the connection.  But the interconnectivity results in aHCl present above TQ.\n\n- The facility is already, and remains, a Program 3 stationary source with accident prevention programs in place.\n\nc) 560 Block Operations:\n\n- Increase in chlorine inventory due to interconnectivity with other processes containing chlorine.  The 560 Block Operations does not have an inventory of chlorine above TQ other than the connection.  But the interconnectivity results in chlorine present above TQ.\n\n- The facility is being now being declared as a Program 3 stationary source due to the connection, but it already had Program 3 accident prevention programs in place. \n\n\n\n15-Jul-2009 - Resubmitted RMP due to a) shutdown of 540 Block process, resulting in total removal of butadiene and acrylonitrile from the site as well as a reduction in aqueous ammonia inv"

Ammonia (anhdyrous) is used in pollution control equipment for a boiler.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Dow Pittsburg site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
