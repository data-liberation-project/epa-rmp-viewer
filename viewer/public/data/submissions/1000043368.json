However, several changes are captured in this update as follows.\n\na) 310 Block Operations:\n\n- Increase in chlorine inventory due to interconnectivity with other processes containing chlorine.  The 310 Block Operations does not have an inventory of chlorine above the Federal RMP threshold quantity (TQ) other than the connection.  But the interconnectivity results in chlorine present above TQ.  \n\n- The facility is already, and remains, a Program 3 stationary source with accident prevention programs in place. \n\nb) 520 Block Operations:\n\n- Reduction of anhydrous ammonia inventory below the Federal RMP TQ due to substantially smaller storage tank.\n\n- Reduction of chlorine inventory, which is still above the RMP TQ, due to storage tanks taken out of service.\n\n- Increase in anhydrous hydrogen chloride (aHCl) due to interconnectivy with other processes containing aHCl.  The 520 Block Operations does not have an inventory of aHCl above TQ other than the connection.  But the interconnectivity results in aHCl present above TQ.\n\n- The facility is already, and remains, a Program 3 stationary source with accident prevention programs in place.\n\nc) 560 Block Operations:\n\n- Increase in chlorine inventory due to interconnectivity with other processes containing chlorine.  The 560 Block Operations does not have an inventory of chlorine above TQ other than the connection.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company, Pittsburg, California site (\"Dow Pittsburg\") is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by Dow Pittsburg's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Dow site in Pittsburg, California.  It is Dow Pittsburg's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Dow Pittsburg is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at Dow Pittsburg is agricultural chemical manufacturing.

Ammonia (anhdyrous) is used in pollution control equipment for a boiler.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Dow Pittsburg site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Dow Pittsburg site was designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nDow Pittsburg maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, equipment specification sheets, reactive chemicals testing reports, and corrosion reports.  This information is regularly reviewed, as needed, and is readily acessible to plant operations personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nDow Pittsburg conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and effectively controlled.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include Dow Fire and Explosion Index (F&EI), Dow Chemical Exposure Index (CEI), Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis (RC/PHA), Hazard and Operability Study ("

Any findings related to the hazard analysis, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Dow Pittsburg's covered processes, written operating procedures are maintained.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  This information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to plant operations personnel.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nDow Pittsburg has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures and safe work practices associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years, and more frequently as needed, for required process and safety topics.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nDow Pittsburg carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe and reliable operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, critical instruments, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices are utilized to carry out appropriate maintenance.  These personnel are also offered specialized training as needed.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nDow Pittsburg conducts audits of compliance systems for RMP requirements on a regular basis.  These audits are carried out at least once every 3 years by a team of qualified personnel.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nDow Pittsburg promptly and carefully investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nDow Pittsburg truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
