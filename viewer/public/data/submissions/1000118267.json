A review of site operations revealed that two substances stored on site were regulated under Section 68.130, which include chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Seven, 1-ton cylinder chlorine tanks and seven, 1-ton cylinder sulfur dioxide tanks are stored in the chlorine building next to the chlorine contact chamber. The total maximum on-site storage of chlorine is 14,000 pounds, and the total maximum on-site storage of sulfur dioxide is 14,000 pounds.

Through this process two specific hazards have been identified: \r\n\r\n\u00bfReuse of gaskets - according to the Chlorine Manual, prepared by the Chlorine Institute, a release of chlorine is most often a result of reusing gaskets.

The review requires a documented inspection of the process and operating procedures to ensure compliance. The hazard review must be updated, at a minimum, every five years or after major process changes. A copy of a hazard review checklist provided in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants is included in the Risk Management Plan document maintained at the facility.
