Over the past five years there have been no accidental releases.\n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe North Terrebonne Gas Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the North Terrebonne Gas Plant is coordinated with the Terrebonne Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.

In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance and maintains an approved contractor list that is used by the North Terrebonne Gas Plant during the selection of a contractor.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe North Terrebonne Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe North Terrebonne Gas Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nEnterprise incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.

Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe North Terrebonne Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage change to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including range of process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe North Terrebonne Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participates as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the North Terrebonne Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the North Terrebonne Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe North Terrebonne Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOwnership interests in the North Terrebonne Gas Plant located in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana are held by multiple companies; Enterprise Gas Processing LLC (formally known as Tejas Gas Processing, LLC) has the largest interest, Dynegy Midstream Services L.P. holds the next largest interest and several other owners hold minor interests.

The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.
