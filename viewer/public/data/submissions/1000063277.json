This butane railcar storage and transloading system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (TRI-FLO Inc.) instructions.  Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\r\n\r\nThis is a new facility; therefore, it has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in-place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Tristar Transload PNW, Inc. - Vancouver Facility butane rai"
