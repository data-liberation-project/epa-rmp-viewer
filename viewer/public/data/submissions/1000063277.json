              "Description": "The on-site Butane Transloading System provides for the transfer of liquefied butane under pressure from butane railcars.  Up to 8 railcars may be stored on-site [approx. maximum 33,600 gallons of water capacity] with a liquefied butane maximum anticipated fill level of 30,000 gallons.  The liquefied butane is offloaded from a railcar through use of a single portable transloader (transloader is moved from railcar to railcar to transfer butane) to pressurized butane trailers.  The system is designed to minimally meet the requirements of NFPA #58 (2017) for siting and safety/control functions.  Notable safety features include Railcar pressure relief valves, thermal/hydrostatic relief valves, check valves, Railcar excess flow valves, pneumatically actuated attachable Excess flow/emergency shutoff valves (Fisher Type), grounding clamps on transloader, LP transfer hoses on transloader, and pneumatic emergency shutoff valves (Snappy Joe type) which fail closed on pneumatic pressure loss.  Additional protection includes an emergency shutoff system including ESD pushbuttons and remote key FOB actuator, and low-melting point (<250oF) pneumatic supply lines (fire protection).",

This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane railcar storage and transloading system only, including the associated piping and storage for up to eight (8) storage tanks (detached railcars).\n\n\n\nThe Tristar Transload PNW, Inc. - Vancouver Facility complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This butane railcar storage and transloading system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (TRI-FLO Inc.) instructions.  Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\n\n\nThis is a new facility; therefore, it has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in-place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Tristar Transload PNW, Inc. - Vancouver Facility butane rai"
