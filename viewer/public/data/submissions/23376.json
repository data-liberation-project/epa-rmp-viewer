      "SummaryText": "CFS West Holdings, Inc.  is a Kansas Corporation having a food  manufacturing facility located in New Century, KS. An integral part of the manufacturing process is the use of refrigeration to cool and/or crystallize the various products and to maintain the finished products at proper storage temperature prior to shipment. At CFS West Holdings, Inc.,  the refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. It is estimated that the refrigeration system contains approximately 23,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia exists as a gas at atmospheric pressure, however,  ammonia is found in both gaseous and liquid (liquified by pressure and liquified by refrigeration) forms within the ammonia refrigeration system, depending upon where it is located in the system. The ammonia refrigeration system is distributed throughout the production and storage areas of the facility.  The largest concentration is in the various system tanks where the majority of the ammonia present is liquified by pressure or by refrigeration. Typical system pressures range from 5 PSIG to 200 PSIG.\n\nCFS West Holdings, Inc.  is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management Regulations 29 CFR Part 1910.119 as well as similar State Regulations. The various elements of the Process Safety Management Program at CFS West Holdings, Inc.  form the core of the accidental release and emergency response efforts at the facility.\n\nFollowing the guidelines set forth under The EPA Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations (i.e. 40 CFR Part 68), the Worst Case Release Scenario was identified as a catastrophic failure of the outside receiver tank such as could occur due to impact from a vehicular collision. While it is very unlikely, it is conceivable that an occurance such as this could release the entire charge of ammonia, and EPA guidance assumes a 10 minute release period. Under worst case atmospheric conditions, it is probable that such a release would result in concentrations of ammonia exceeding the"

      "SummaryText": "level of concern in populated areas. Depending upon the wind direction, this release has the potential to impact private residences, schools, churches, other businesses, an interstate highway, as well as airfield  runways and taxiways located at the New Century industrial complex. Worst Case Scenario modelling was performed using RMPComp.\n\nAdditionally, a more likely alternate release scenario was investigated. This alternate release assumes that piping serving a process evaporator located inside the facility is opened without being properly isolated and evacuated. While the likelyhood of this type of occurence is low due to the facility's training program, an accident such as this could result in a substantial release of ammonia into the building. The largest impact of this release would be on the facility itself as the building would trap much of the ammonia inside thereby providing passive mitigation. Over time, as the ammonia gradually left the building through normal ventilation, the impacted area would grow to include areas off of the site. Modelling indicates that the effects of this type of release would be generally limited to the surrounding industrial area with minimal impact of residential occupancies. Alternate Release Scenario modelling was performed using RMPComp.\n\nThis is a new facility and has no accidents to report. \n\nCFS West Holdings, Inc. is committed to process safety and as such has endeavored to design and construct a facility which can be operated safely throughout its life. The facility, including the ammonia refrigeration system,  was designed and built by carefully selected professional engineers and experienced contractors."
