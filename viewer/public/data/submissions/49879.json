Its emergency response program includes a written response plan with specific actions to be taken by Gaylord Chemical personnel and information to be provided to responders in the event of an incident.  Gaylord Chemical also works with local emergency response agencies and members of the community to review and improve its emergency response program.\n\n   \u00bf   Facility and regulated substances handled.\n\nAt its Bogalusa plant, Gaylord Chemical makes two products\u00bfDMS (dimethyl sulfide) and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide)\u00bfand sells and ships them to customers in countries around the world.  Gaylord Chemical makes DMS by combining sulfur with organic wood by-products obtained from a near-by paper mill.  DMS is used for a variety of purposes, including as a safety odorant in natural gas.  Gaylord Chemical sells some of the DMS it manufactures and combines the remainder with oxygen and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), to make DMSO.   DMSO is used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.  N2O4 is a regulated substance under Louisiana regulations.  N2O4 exists only under pressure and when released a portion immediately becomes nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas, a common combustion product.  N2O4 is transported, stored, and used directly from one-ton steel cylinders.  While connected to the process, the cylinders are contained within a building equipped with an emergency scrubber to mitigate a release.\n\n\n   \u00bf"

Periodic audits assure compliance.\n\n   \u00bf   Five year accident history.\n\nGaylord Chemical\u00bfs past five year accident history includes no accidents covered by these regulations.  \n\n   \u00bf   Emergency response program.\n\nGaylord Chemical\u00bfs emergency response program is set forth in its written Emergency Plan and includes actions to be taken by Gaylord Chemical personnel in the event of many types of emergencies.  Gaylord Chemical coordinates emergency preparedness measures with local emergency response agencies including the Bogalusa Police Department, Bogalusa Fire Department, and the Washington Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (the designated LEPC).\nEmergency preparedness training for plant employees includes first aid, CPR, hazardous materials awareness and emergency notification procedures, and fire safety training.   Gaylord Chemical maintains a list of qualified emergency hazardous materials contractors available to assist in emergencies requiring specialized expertise. Finally, Gaylord Chemical has chemical monitoring instruments to warn of leaks and an emergency alarm system, which is tested weekly.\nIn addition to Gaylord Chemical\u00bfs internal Emergency Plan, Gaylord Chemical works with the City of Bogalusa and Washington Parish under its emergency preparedness plan that includes coordinated public safety and emergency response measures for Bogalusa and the surrounding area, including the following: a city-wide siren system; a traffic al"
