      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary  Risk Management\n\nCommunity Water System, Inc. has a Risk Management Plan for Accidental Releases Prevention and also a Emergency Response Policy which is incorporated into a countywide emergency plan.  In 1989 under Title III, the Office of the County Judge, Cleburne County, Arkansas, ordered an Emergency Response and Hazardous Material Spill Emergency Plan be developed, and implemented.  The purpose of this plan was to develop a list of companies, businesses, factories and facilities that stored or maintained chemicals, fuels, gases or other substances that were identified as Hazardous.\n\nThe Emergency Plan required a Response Procedure and was developed through the Cleburne County Committee formed under Title III.  The Committee addressed the following areas and detailed how each of the responsible agencies was to react.  These areas include but are not limited to the following:\n\n1. Communications\n2. Prompting Form\n3. Prompting Form Response Vehicles\n4. County Emergency Operations\n5. Emergency Equipment\n6. Health and Medical\n7. Health and Medical Resources\n8. Health and Medical Organization Chart\n9. Incident Report\n10. Shelters\n11. Law Enforcement\n12. Hazardous Materials - Transportation Routes and Maps\n13. Direction, Control and Communications\n14. Emergency Public Information\n\nCommunity Water System, Inc. is a part of this countywide plan and was instrumental in its development as our facility uses and stores Chlorine Gas.  We use other chemicals, which have been identified as Non-Hazardous.  \n\nOn site safety for loading, unloading, handling and use of 150-pound cylinders of Chlorine has been addressed in our written plan for all location where they might be kept or stored.  Safety equipment availability, location and use are a part of our safety training.  \n\nSafety procedures have been developed using State and Federal guidelines.  The Board of Directors and Management of Community Water System, Inc. have adopted a company policy"

      "SummaryText": "for implementation of these guidelines. \n\nCommunity Water System, Inc. is Water Treatment Facility located on the shore of Greers Ferry lake.  We provide water to both retail and wholesale customers.  Our retail system provides water to approximately 4,381 customers.  Our wholesale customer base is approximately 33,000.  Our existing Water Treatment Plant has capacity of 6.0 m.g.d and raw water is purchased from the Corp. of Engineers.\n\n\n\n\nFacility Operation\n\nRaw water is drawn from the lake through intake structures and is pumped up to the plant.  These intake pipes (3 ea.) are connected to three pumps that deliver 2100 g.p.m each, which is equal to the plant capacity of 6,000,000 gallons per day.  The pumps are redundant and no more than two pumps will be pumping at one time.\n\nThe water is pumped through a flow meter to record the amount of water taken from the lake.  Water samples are taken of this raw water to determine the amount of chemicals to be added, and flows from this point to a flash mixer.  At this point lime and polymer (PAC 950) is added based on previous water samples. The water is sampled again and then travels to the Claircone.  At this location anionic is added at the base of the Claircone and a small amount of chlorine used for algae control is also added near the top of the Claircone.  The process at the Claircone traps suspended particles in the water and settles them out.  The water then flows to a bank of twelve filters.  From the filters the water is Chlorinated and flows to a 1,000,000-gallon storage tank.  Water in this tank is piped to the High Service Building and then pumped from this building to either the retail or the wholesale transmission systems.  This pump system is also redundant.\n\nChemicals Used and Stored\n\nChlorine gas storage is in 150-lb. gas cylinders.  Under normal conditions a maximum of 18 bottles will be on hand with 3 to 4 bottles being empty for a total capacity of 2,250 or 2,100 lbs. respectively of actively stored"

It is anticipated that normal storage levels (18 bottles) of Chlorine will be back to normal in the spring of 2000.\n\nLime storage at maximum capacity is 42,000 lbs.\n\nPAC 950 (polymer) storage at maximum capacity is 45,000 lbs.\n\nAnionic storage at maximum capacity is 18,000 lbs.\n\nHazardous Materials listed above include only CHLORINE.\n\nActions for On or Offsite Chemical Release (Worst Case) Chlorine\n\nCondition:\n\n* Chlorine released due to leaking or damaged 150-lb. bottle.   \n* Cylinder dropped during change out.\n* Manifold piping, control valve or feeders damaged.\n\nResult:\n\nA quantity of 150 lbs. of Chlorine Gas is released into the atmosphere.  As indicated by OCA guidance a distance of up to 0.7 miles or a 3,696-foot radius from the release point could be effected. All storage areas for Chlorine have vent fans and alarm systems. There is a serious potential for personal injury within this confined area and the following is to be implemented immediately. \n\n\nNotification:\n\nPersonnel in the immediate area should clear the area and notify management of the emergency situation.\n\nResponse:\n\nOffice personnel and management will be responsible for immediate implementation of the Emergency Plan. \n\nEvaluation:\n\n1.

The outcome of that gas release was a new safety procedure with the main component being a Buddy System.  Our facility has gone through extensive reconstruction in the past three years and alarm systems have now been installed and tested which notify plant personnel of a chemical or gas leak.\n\nCommunity Water System, Inc. is a part of the Cleburne County, Arkansas Emergency Response and Hazardous Material Spill Emergency Plan.

It establishes guidelines for response and coordination by all Emergency Personnel and Equipment, Law Enforcement, State, Federal Agencies and notification procedures. This document contains Hazardous Material Source, Emergency Response Team locations and phone numbers.  It also informs the user of the number of personnel available by location and the equipment they have operational.  This plan is complete with maps, which identify the Hazardous Material Source, and the areas covered or involved should a release occur of any material that has been identified as Hazardous.  This type of information was developed for the evacuation of populated areas in the event of a major chemical or gas release.\n\nTo improve our existing safety program Community Water System, Inc. has requested that our insurance carrier provide an onsite review of all safety training and any potential problems or deficiencies in our program.
