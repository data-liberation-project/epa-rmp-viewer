Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTexas American Foodservice recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Fort Worth facility.\n\n\nThe facility has  developed and implemented accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr.Lou Ciferni, Plant Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nIn addition to the PSM and RM programs, the facility follows these guidelines. \nSafety Management Guidlines\nSafety Committee\nAccident Investigation Committee\n\n\nB.

The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 22,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Fort Worth facility involves the release of 10,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the Pressure Recirculator.  This quantity represents the maximum quantity of ammonia in the recirculator at any time.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n         The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n         Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the receiver; \n         Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n         An ammonia detector is located near the recirculator;\n         The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of vessels; \n         The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and,\n         The facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases.\n\nThe alternative release scenario at the facility involves the release of 3600 pounds of ammonia over a 60 minute period through a defective pressure safety valve (PSV) on the control press"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n         Employee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n         Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n         Process Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist  Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards. Any recommendations are resolved to improve facility safety. \n\n         Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely"
