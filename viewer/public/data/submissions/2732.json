General accidental release and prevention policy of McCain Foods USA, Inc.\r\n\r\nIn this food product manufacturing facility we use/store anhydrous ammonia which is considered\r\nhazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes\r\nit necessary to observe certain safety precautions during ammonia use to prevent human exposure,\r\nreduce the threat to our workers' personal health, the surrounding community and the\r\nenvironment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state regulations.  Safety\r\ndepends directly on our proper handling of ammonia combined with the safety devices that are\r\nincorporated in our facility and the safe handling procedures that our personnel are trained in.\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\r\n\r\nMcCain Foods USA, 801 Rockwell Avenue, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin is responsible for the\r\nmanufacturing of frozen vegetables, assorted cheese products and appetizers. There are\r\napproximately 300 employees at this facility which includes hourly and salaried personnel.  The\r\nplant manufactures product around the clock, (5) five days a week. \r\n\r\n McCain Foods is located in an industrial park on the south west side of Fort Atkinson,\r\nWisconsin.  In addition to our manufacturing facility the industrial park also houses other\r\nmanufacturing or business facilities.  \r\n\r\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the McCain Foods facility is ANHYDROUS\r\nAMMONIA.   Anhydrous ammonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard\r\n34-1989. The dominant characteristic of ammonia vapor is the pungent, distinct odor.  Persons\r\nexposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations, although these\r\nlevels would not result in any health risks.\r\n \r\nRisks from accidental exposu"

The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.   \r\nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\r\nbut only in a very narrow, high concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nThe normal operating level of ammonia that is used/stored at the McCain Foods facility is 17,000 \r\npounds. The anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant chemical in the manufacturing/storage \r\nprocess. The possible hazards that could lead to an accidental release include, but are not limited\r\nto, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Worst case release scenario and alternate release scenarios including administrative and\r\nengineering controls to prevent, or limit the amount of release.\r\n\r\n    Worst case release scenario criteria for McCain Foods USA facility:\r\n\r\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR)\r\nlocated inside the McCain Foods machine room.  This vessels' normal operating level is 5,380\r\npounds of liquid ammonia,  approximately 50% of it's total capacity. Although the receivers\r\nmaximum capacity is 10,760 pounds, this exceeds company policy of only allowing an 80% level\r\nat any time. \r\n     \r\n     Ammonia Quantity:                  5,300 pounds\r\n     Rate of Release:                   530lbs / min.
