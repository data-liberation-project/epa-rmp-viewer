Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at all T&A facilities.  The same management and maintenance personnel are responsible for maintaining the ammonia refrigeration equipment to prevent accidents, and for responding to an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\nThere are both portable and fixed refrigeration systems onsite and all have safeties to detect unsafe operating conditions.  The fixed system supports the main cold storage facility and has an ammonia detection system tied into an alarm system that is monitored 24 hours per day.  The portable systems have no detection since the units are outdoors.  Operators are present to monitor these units when they are running.  There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Stand Operating Procedures) and the maintenance program.\nDescription of Source and Substance Handled\n\nAt the Spreckels facility, ammonia refrigeration systems are used for cold storage, produce precooling and ice generation.  A fixed system is attached to the cold storage building and is used for cold storage, pressure cooling and hydrocooling.  The portable refrigeration equipment is trailer mounted and is used for vacuum cooling and ice generation.  The fixed refrigeration system was started in April, 1988 with major additions completed in 1995 and 1996.  An existing dry storage room was converted into a refrigerated room for product consolidation in 1995 and expanded in 2000.  The cold storage rooms are designed as per current appli"

The total charge for the all the refrigeration systems is approximately 63,500 lbs \n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nT&A maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.
