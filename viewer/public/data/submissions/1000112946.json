The facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the Grant County LEPC. The Medford Fractionator Incident Commander is responsible for coordinating the initial emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials. The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\t\nContinued compliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n?\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedures are considered.\n?\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?\tThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous rele"

      "SummaryText": ". There were also two additional flammable mixtures, EP Mix and Natural Gasoline, that contained greater than 1% of an RMP substance. The flammable mixtures were stored at the facility in amounts greater than the RMP threshold quantities. There are no toxic substances present at the plant in amounts greater than the RMP threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by OHLP. These high standards include:\n?\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n?\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n?\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n?\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Medford Fractionator is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Part of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n?\tProviding overpressure relief valves on all pressurized vessels.  Additionally, level transmitters and alarms are present on all vessels to prevent overfilling.\n?\tProviding a Raw Feed Diversion to reduce potential incidents.\n?\tTesting of vessels and preventive maintenance through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n?\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a vapor recovery unit and a pilot-lit flare for emergencies."

      "SummaryText": "Medford Fractionator\nONEOK Hydrocarbon, L.P. (OHLP)\nMedford, Oklahoma\n\nINTRODUCTION AND POLICIES\n\nOHLP Hydrocarbon, L.P. (OHLP) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  OHLP management goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Medford Fractionator is a facility operated by OHLP. The Medford Fractionator is currently decommissioned and out of service due to a significant event referenced in the 5-Year accident history. Subsequently, the butane sphere(s) were de-inventoried as of November 10th, 2022, leaving de-methanized raw feed storage as the facility\u0092s only RMP covered process at this time. Normal operations in the past entailed natural gas liquids (de-methanized raw feed) being received at the site from natural gas facilities as feedstock. The liquid feed to the facility was then split into five product streams in a series of fractionator columns: E-P Mix, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, and Natural Gasoline. These five product streams were further purified to remove contaminants such as water and carbon dioxide. Purity products were then stored and distributed to various customers via pipeline. \n\nPropane, Butane, and Isobutane were also stored at the facility in amounts greater than the RMP threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.)"
