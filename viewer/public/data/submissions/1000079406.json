Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of West Central FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Oneida-Wataga Fire Department, Knox County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA's)\"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"(6th edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\", as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n5. Five "

The facility has:\n\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nIn the event of emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Oneida-Wataga Fire Department and Knox County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
