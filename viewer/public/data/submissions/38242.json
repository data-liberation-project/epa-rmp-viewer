A liquid fertilizer production and storage facility is located on the property, which is situated on the west side of Wilcox Street in the Town of Cohocton, New York.  The only building located on the site is a portable office trailer that is mounted on a steel beam support skid. The facility employs 2 full-time personnel.\n\nThe liquid fertilizer production and storage facility consists of the following: an office trailer, a reactor and associated equipment that mix ammonia, phosphoric acid, and water into an ammonium polyphosphate liquid fertilizer, known as 10-34-0; a group of 22 above ground steel liquid fertilizer storage tanks (19 are located in a concrete containment structure); a transfer platform for loading liquid fertilizer product onto trucks; an above ground steel tank that is used to store anhydrous ammonia on site; and two above ground steel tanks (one used to store water and the other used for intermittent product storage).  A 500,000 gallon free standing product storage tank with a liner is located outside the containment syatem.  While ammonia used to produce fertilizer product is stored onsite, phosphoric acid is shipped to the facility by rail car on an as needed basis (no phosphoric acid stored on site in tanks).  A rail spur, operated and maintained by the BH Railroad is located at the facility, rear and parallel to Wilcox Street.\n\nThe office trailer consists of office area for the facility operator, controls associated with the fertilizer reactor, records storage, and product quality testing equipment.  The reactor and associated equipment are located on a concrete slab on grade.\n\nThe facility is bordered by the following: a residence, an American Legion Post, and the BH rail track to the north and farther north, the Cohocton River; Wilcox Street, a vehicle maintenance garage and sand and sa"

Property uses in the area are residential and commercial.\n\nUse of the Yara property, since 1982, has been commercial (i.e. production, storage, and distribution of bulk liquid agricultural fertilizers).\n\nThe land in the vicinity of the facility is relatively flat and slopes gradually downhill from the southeast to the northwest.\n\nThe area surrounding the site is designated as a significant sand and gravel aquifer by the New York Geological Survey. Based on regional topography and surface drainage, ground water appears to be moving generally in a northwesterly directions towards the Cohocton River.\n\nThe site is covered by the reactor, the storage tanks and concrete containment, asphalt staging roads, parking and perimeter areas, and grassed areas.\n\nWhen the reator is operated, drip pans are placed below the hose connections to contain chemical leaks (e.g. phosporic acid, when transferred from rail cars). In addition, the concrete pad, on which the reactor and associated equipment is mounted, contains a concrete in ground collection sump, that collects and contains chemical or product leaks, spills, or equipment wash down run-off.  Liquid collected in the sump is used as product make-up water.  The pad and sump are intact, in good condition, and make no cracks in the concrete pad.\n\nThe product tank concrete containment is intact and in good condition.  The containment is sized to contain 125 percent of the volume of the largest storage tank, or approximately 45,000 gallons.

The tank is intact and in good condition and with no evidence of leaking ammonia.  The tank's structural integrity was tested and approved in 1990, 1995 and 2000.  A barbed wire topped, chainlink fence is installed around the facility perimeter, including the ammonia tank, to provide facility security.\n\nThe site has a written health and safety plan that conatins management systems pertaining to, but not limited to, emergency preparedness, process hazard analysis, standard operating procedures, hazard communication, permit to work, management of change and contractor management.\n\nThe site is audited annually by corporate staff.  Both site employees have all of the training and expertise necessary for ammonia handling."
