      "SummaryText": "1   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nLeprino Foods Company is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent in our comprehensive accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Chaves County LEPC, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nLeprino Foods Company (LFC) operates a cheese and whey manufacturing facility.  The plant is located at 5600 Omaha Road, Roswell, New Mexico.  LFC maintains one 112R listed substance in a regulated quanity on site.  Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS # 7664-41-7,  is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing process  The maximum intended physical inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia located at the LFC plant is approximately 75,200 lb.\n\n\n3  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and EPA Model RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nConsequence modeling was conducted to determine the release distances from the site under theoretical conditions, based on worst case and one additional alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario represents a release of the largest ves"

Release distances were calculated using Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, and toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  No credit has been taken for existing active and passive mitigation systems that reduce the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe alternative scenario analysis models a theoretical ammonia release from an oil drain valve connected to an intercooler oil pot. The theroretical opening size is 3/4\" .  The theoretical release rate was 565 lbs./minute.  The guidance used to develop the release distance did not assume a specific release duration and is applicable to releases of all lengths. In the event of an actual release, it is expected that an operator would intervene to stop the release with a 10-minute period.\n\n\n4  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nLeprino Foods Co. has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth by the EPA under 40 CFR part 68.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nLeprino Foods Company conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a What If/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel wi"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Leprino Foods Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nLeprino Foods Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nLeprino Foods Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nLeprino Foods Company believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.

LFC experienced a reportable release of andryhous ammonia in the amount of approximately 400 lbs. on April 15, 2000.  This leak was contained and facility and procedural changes have been implemented to prevent future accidental releases from this system.\n\n\n6  Emergency Response Plan\nLeprino Foods Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
