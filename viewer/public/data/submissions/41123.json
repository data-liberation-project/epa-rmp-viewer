      "SummaryText": "1.  POLICIES.  A.  An accidental release of a regulated substance would be detected by strategically-located Volatile Organic Chemical (VOC) monitors which would immediately alert production personnel as well as a central alarm station.  All containers are leakproof-tested before and after filling.  A security plan is in place, the facility has a perimeter fence, and all containers / equipment are stored in locked enclosures during off hours.  B.  An Emergency Action Plan has been prepared and submitted to the Orange County LEPC and the Slate Hill Fire Department as well as the State Police and Town of Wawayanda specifying a response and warning system in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The facility also conducts quarterly evacuation drills.  2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.  A.  The primary activity involving a regulated substance is the repackaging of chemicals into smaller containers for use by spice fumigation companies.  B.  The regulated substance is:  Ethylene Oxide.  3.  PREVENTION.  A.  The regulated substance at the Slate Hill plant is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  A.  There have been no catastrophic or potentially catastrophic releases of any regulated substance during the past five years.  5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.  A.  Evacuation drills are conducted quarterly.  An evaluation of each drill is completed and changes are made based on the findings.  B.  Periodic tours are provided to the local fire department.  C.  The plan is filed with local response agencies.  6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.  A.  In 2003, the total quantity of regulated substance on site at any one time was reduced approximately 90% and the size of the containers used on site was reduced by over 99%.  B.  Future safety improvements included improved site security and increased training."
