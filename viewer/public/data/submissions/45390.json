Russel, CEO, thru Danny Wells, Maintenance Manager, to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.   CBI has an on-going training program which updates personnel on a routine basis for changes, problems and technologies pertaining to the ammonia refrigeration system.  CBI personnel have been trained and are maintained current in accordance with the OSHA 29CFR1910.120 - Hazwoper Emergency Response Standard.\n   CBI has registered the ammonia refrigeration facility with the State of Florida."

CBI currently employs over 1400 personnel on a full-time and part-time basis.  CBI is the proud sponsor of many youth,civic, academic and public organizations.        \n   CBI has bulit a state of the art, refrigeration and warehouse facility for wholesale distribution of raw and ready to eat process foods.   \n   This facilty was designed/engineered by Mollenberg & Betz,  design, build and certify the ammonia system that keeps the frozen food preserved until shipped to the end user.  CBI has complied with the OSHA 29CFR1910.119 Process Safety Management for Anhyrdrous Ammonia.  In preparing the the PSM it was determined there was not a general hazard to the emloyees at the facilty due to the fact that the ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system itself.  The hazard is present to maintenance personnel when performing repairs or replacing vavles, guages, etc. on the system.  This repair work is done in a very controlled environment which isolates the repair section and reduces the amount of ammonia lost to a very minimum.  Since the facility is less than 10years old and in very good working condition; it is estimated that less than 20 pounds of ammonia may have been lost from the system due to maintenance.  All CBI refrigeration maintenance personnel are well trained, certified by Mollenberg & Betz, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration systems.  All CBI maintenance personnel are OSHA 40-Hour Hazwoper trained for Emergency Response at the facility.  The training was conducted in house by certified instructor on staff.     CBI has the necessary emergency response personnel and equipment on-site to handle minor emergencies that may occur.  In case of a major release CBI will implement it's Emerge"
