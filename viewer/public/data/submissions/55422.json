      "SummaryText": "El Dorado Irrigation District has been requested by the cognizant Administering Agency, El Dorado County Environmental Health Department, to institute a Risk Management Program for their water supply facility, Reservoir No. 1, containing chlorine, a Regulated Substance (RS).  This request was made in <<Month, Year>> pursuant to California Health & Safety Code (H&SC) Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Section 25534(b)(1) and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).   The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  The current filing is to meet the requirements of a 5 year update.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nEl Dorado Irrigation District provides water supply and distribution in El Dorado County.  Its water treatment facility, Reservoir 1, is located off Gilmore Rd., Pollock Pines, CA in El Dorado County, and uses chlorine, a RS, for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located north of the Pony Express "

      "SummaryText": "Trail, near portions of the El Dorado National Forest.  There is one full-time employee at this site.  Chlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container scales and storage trunnions inside the building.  The chlorine is used to control biological growth on the filters and to disinfect the treated water.  Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a regulator valve attached to the ton container's gas valve.  The chlorine under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators located in the same room, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of El Dorado Irrigation District that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, El Dorado Irrigation District has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by El Dorado Irrigation District are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\nEl Dorado Irrigation District has instituted a Process"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for El Dorado Irrigation District's operations. The program and document mangement procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, changing from a pressure system to using vacuum regulator valves attached to the container gas valves..\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEl Dorado Irrigation District's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  El Dorado Irrigation District maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine releases at its facilities using chlorine.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which El Dorado Irrigation District committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
