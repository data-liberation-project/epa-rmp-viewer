Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of CYRO's way of doing business.  CYRO-Fortier facility is located at the Fortier industrial site, owned and operated by Cytec Industries Inc. (Cytec).  CYRO-Fortier uses Cytec Industries? established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As part of the Fortier site, CYRO subscribes to the codes established for American Chemistry Council?s Responsible Care ?.\n\n68.155 (b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe CYRO-Fortier facility consists of a continuous manufacturing plant producing methyl methacrylate (the MMA process).  The process at the Fortier facility that produces a regulated substance is methyl methacrylate.   \n\nMethyl methacrylate (MMA Process) is used to make many products such as plastics, floor wax and medical devices.  The regulated substance involved with this continuous operation is hydrocyanic acid.\n\n68.155 (c) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nCYRO's general accidental release prevention program includes:\n\n?    EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n?    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n?    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response\n?    Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n?    Generally recognized & accepted engineering codes and standards\n?

High level interlock on acetone cyanohydrin (ACH) Reactor shuts valves on HCN inlet to prevent overflow.\n?    Leak detection systems on ACH Stock Tanks to provide early detection of a leak on the ACH tank floor.\n?    Upgraded material of construction on ACH Stock Tanks to stainless steel.\n?    Installed system to collect vent emissions from ACH Stock Tanks to prevent emissions to atmosphere.\n?    Interlocks on ACH Reactor system to prevent release due to overpressure or high temperature.\n?    Upgraded level control and installed redundant level indicator on Stripper Lights Collection Pot to minimize the potential for release to atmosphere due to overpressure of Stripper Column.\n?    Installed sealless pumps on the Crude ACH system.\n\n68.155 (d) THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nUpon review of the accident history files for the CYRO-Fortier MMA plant, it has been determined that no applicable incidents occurred at the MMA plant during the past five years.\n\n  \n 68.155 (e) THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCYRO?s Emergency Procedures are implemented under Cytec?s Emergency Response Program.  The procedures, which contain plant emergency response guidelines, were developed to reduce the risk of a chemical release to employees and the public.  Communications are with both Jefferson and St. Charles Parish's departments of emergency management, the City of Kenner fire department, Louisiana State Emergency Response, and others as needed.  Fortier responds to incidents with a facility Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responders Operations level.  We have a Community Alert Network (CAN) automated system that can call to warn neighbors of emergency, as well as call in additional Cytec personnel if needed in the event of an emergency.  We also have access to a parish-wide siren/message warning system, should it become necessary to notify neighbor"

Fortier also has mutual aid agreements with local agencies, which can assist in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n68.155 (f) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe CYRO-Fortier Plant is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, and inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety.\n\n\nTITLE V AIR PERMITS   \n\nCYRO-Fortier currently has one Title V Operating Permit as follows:\n\n    Facility    Permit I.D.\nMethyl Methacrylate Plant    1982 (V-2)\n\nThis permit is currently in the name of Cytec Industries Inc.  Following the closure of sale on May 31, 2005, an application will be made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality for a change in ownership and the permit will be transferred to CYRO.\n\nPUBLIC RECEPTORS\n\nThe alternative scenario for a release of HCN (toxic) indicated that a population of 129 would be affected within the 0.3 mile radius endpoint.  This population was calculated using the software program LandView 5.  The software determines population by adding all residents within any census block that may touch the circle.  CYRO has confirmed that there are no residences within this 0.3 mile circle.  The reported population of 129 is an artifact of LandView 5 in that the program includes all residents within Census Block 1002 because that census block location point lies within the circle of radius 0.3 mile.   \n\nTOPOGRAPHY\n\nThe urban option was used in dispersion projections for endpoint.  Urban was chosen because of the immediate urban area north of the river and the quasi-urban environment inside of the plant boundaries. \n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA) REVIEWS\n\nThe information submitted is true, accurate and complete as of May 19, 2005."
