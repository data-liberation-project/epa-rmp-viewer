The information supplied by the contractor is retained on site while the contractor in engaged in work activities.\n\nPrior to commencing work on site, each contractor employee receives a safety orientation by the Safety Department. The safety orientation covers information on the hazards associated with the process areas where the work will be performed, safety procedures and systems to be sued, overview of the site emergency response program including specific procedures to be followed in case of an emergency, and a review of site safety rules and applicable operating procedures. A record of each contractor employee's sign-off on the safety orientation is maintained on file at the site, including the date the training was completed. Once the safety orientation is complete, the contractor is responsible to ensure that each contractor employee performs the assigned  work in a manner consistent with the information provided during the safety orientation. If the contractor assigns new employees to the job after work has commenced, the contractor must also ensure that each new employee receives a safety orientation prior to starting work on site. Failure of the contractor or any contractor employee to abide by these requirements is grounds for immediate dismissal from the site.\n\nThese elements all form components of the site's PSM Program.
