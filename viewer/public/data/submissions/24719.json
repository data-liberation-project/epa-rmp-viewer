Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios, including a\ndiscussion of administrative and mitigative measures used to\nminimize the affects of the release are described below.\nOne worst case release scenario is provided for the Plant,\ni.e., the scenario with the farthest endpoint, and an\nalternative release scenario is provided for each toxic\nchemical. The distinguishing differences between the two types\nof scenarios are: (1) the USEPA specifically defines the\nparameters of the worst case releases scenario and (2) only the\nalternative release scenario takes into account the\naccident/release prevention measures that are in-place to\nprevent and mitigate any release.\n\n   \n   \n   \n   A. Worst Case Release Scenario\n   The USEPA defined worst case scenario for the Plant,\n   involves a complete failure of the acrylonitrile storage\n   tank during which the maximum contents (24,000 gallons) are\n   released within 10 minutes. This scenario does not take\n   into consideration any of the multi-layered prevention\n   measures that are in-place to prevent this release scenario\n   from occurring.\n   \n   The distance to the release endpoint as defined by USEPA,\n   i.e., distance after which the released plume has dispersed\n   to an acceptable concentration of 0.076 milligrams of\n   acrylonitrile per liter of air, is 2.2 miles.\n   \n   B. Alternative Release Scenarios\n   The alternative release scenarios were developed and\n   selected in accordance with a risk based protocol.  This\n   protocol uses the process HAZOPS and integrates the\n   likelihood of occurrence and the offsite severity potential\n   into the scenario selection process.  The alternative\n   release scenarios and their corresponding release endpoints\n   are:\n   \n          =    A two minute release from the acrylonitrile tank due to\n            overfilling.  This scenario assumes that all or some of the\n            following accident/release prevention measures fail:"
