CD-106 System chemicals are listed as a regulated flammable substance in EPA's Risk Management Program rule, with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The CD-106 system storage, distillation and transfer process at Organic Technologies contains up to 100,000 pounds of chemical and materials.\n\n\n\n2) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility:\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Coshocton facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place to ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors and the community around us.  On a local level, this prevention program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n\n\n* Documented process safety information to ensure the process design is understood and maintained throughout its life;\n\n* Process hazard analysis to identify and control all of the hazards associated with handling flammable substances;\n\n* Processes are designed and engineered with process specific safety controls;\n\n* Trained operators, using written operating procedures, to safely operate the process as intended; and work with Delta \"V\" automated process control system\n\n* Maintenance programs and procedures to ensure the on-going mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\n\n\n3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation. The accident prevention programs in place are in compliance with the OSHA's Process Safety Management  (PSM) rule and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.

This incorporates extensive safety instrumentation such as temperature indication, pressure indication, level transmitters, high-level safeties, % LEL gas detectors, coupled with the Delta V Process Control System providing alarms and interlocks. The facility is maintained by identifying all process safety critical equipment and performing routine inspections to ensure proper operation and mechanical integrity. A work order management system is used to control maintenance on the systems. All maintenance employees are trained in preventive maintenance and operations employees are trained to properly follow approved procedures. The individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. The CD-106 distillation system was built following NFPA 58 design and ASME Pressure Piping Code and installation guidelines. Organic Technologies has an active Accident/Incident Investigation program and initiates investigations within 48 hours. In concert with the Coshocton Fire Department and the Emergency Management Director   a NFPA Fire Safety Analysis was conducted.   Organic Technologies has two professional engineers on staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n4) The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at Organic Technologies in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n5) The Emergency Response Program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Organic Technologies has an emergency action plan in place, which contains procedures for employees to follow, including notification of local response agencies.  All facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency action plan, and Organic Technologies policy requires that emergency drills be conducted at least annually. Organic Technologies employees will not respond to an emergency as the organization does not have trained first responders. In the ev"

The Coshocton Fire Department has been informed of the storage of CD-106 System materials and the Coshocton Fire Department conducts an annual site walkthrough of the system. The CD-106 system has its own emergency shutdown devices located in three key areas. Part of the shutdown procedure involves disconnecting the electrical supply to the facility, shutting the facility natural gas supply and performing the CD-106 Distillation System emergency shutdown.\n\n\n\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nOrganic Technologies is committed to the continual improvement of its safety, health and environmental programs. Below are some of the major steps we will be considering to improve safety at our facility over the coming year.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes:\n\n1)  Continue to review and update process specific training programs\n\n2)  Improve the MOC program\n\n3)  Improve the permitting process to add safe work permitting"
