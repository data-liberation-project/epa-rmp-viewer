      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies Review:\nManagement is committed to the safe use of anhydrous ammonia.  Safety programs include formal training and on-the-job training activities.  Material Safety Data Sheets and other chemical related safety information is made available to employees.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances:\nThis facility receives, stores, and ships anhydrous ammonia for re-sale purposes only (retail to the end user-crop production).  This is a minor portion of the facility's business.  This facility is primarily a fertilizer, ag-chem, and ag-product handling facility.  The facility has one 10,000 gallon storage tank.  The facility receives inbound anhydrous ammonia via transport trucks.  The one-tank system is used for storage of the material until it is sold for use by the customer.\n\nWorst-case Scenario:\nThe Worst-case scenario would be release of the entire volume of the 10,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nAlternate-release Scenario:\nThe Alternate-release scenario assumed a rupture of a 2-inch pipe or hose with employee intervention by closing a valve two minutes after the release began.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nRelease prevention activities include daily observations, routine equipment inspections, and annual maintenance/evaulation of equipment.  Operating and maintenance procedures have been developed.  Employee training programs are continuously reviewed and updated.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\nThere have been no accidental releases within the past five (5) years that resulted in off-site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nEmergency response activities include coordination with the local volunteer fire department.  Employees are aware of the Emergency Response Plan. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nAll equipment is being reviewed and upgraded as needed.  All written plans and procedures are being reviewed and employee refresher training will be conducted."
