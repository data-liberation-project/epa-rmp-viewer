      "SummaryText": "The North Coast Superaqueduct project is an integrated water treatment and distribution system. It consists of raw water abstraction, storage and pumping to a water treatment plant where potable water is produced. The treated water up to 100MGD flows by gravity through a transmission pipeline of approximately 50 Km serving municipalities along the north coast of Puerto Rico and the metropolitan area of San Juan. The water treatment plant is situated in the town of Arecibo in the Miraflores ward. The project is owned by the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA).  It is operated by Caribbean Water Specialist Corp. Caribbean Water Specialist Corp., is responsible for day-to-day operation. Chlorine is used at the water treatment plant for the disinfection of the treated water supply. Chlorine is delivered to site on a purpose built road transporter (contained in 1 ton drums).  The unloading, loading and handling of drums is only done using a purpose designed fixed crane and lifting beam. The supplier has been selected after a tendering procedure, which included a review of safety management and operating systems.  The chlorine installation is designed so that all chlorine storage, handling and use is carried out in a well-defined single, segregated building.  The building is designed to meet local building codes including earthquake protection.  The unloading bay and storage area are set back from any site road traffic and fully enclosed by an open sided concrete structure fitted with full height steel mesh panels. The chlorine scale and chlorinator rooms are adjacent and fully enclosed concrete structures. Access to all areas is through normally locked doors and the area is also protected by a closed circuit TV security system. All access doors are fitted with strobe light and horn alarms and warning signs. The drum store has purpose built trunnion storage cradles for fifty-four (54) drums. The area has fixed chlorine leak detectors at the perimeter of the s"

      "SummaryText": "tore. The chlorine scale room has trunnions for four drums arranged as pairs either side of a change over switch.  Each drum will be connected to the pipe system using flexible aluminum pipes (pigtails). The pipe system is designed to be compact and arranged to prevent accidental mechanical damage from drum lifting operations. It is fitted with pressure switches, bursting discs and expansion bottles to protect against over pressurization and release to the atmosphere. Each drum will be fitted with automatic drum valve shutdown devices connected to the chlorine leak detection system and remote manual emergency switches. The chlorine scale room is fitted with a floor level ventilation system, which continuously purges the atmosphere within the room.  In the event of a leak being detected by the permanently installed floor level chlorine sensors, this will shut and the ventilation louvers will close to contain the leak inside the room. The chlorine will be drawn from the drum as liquid and passed through one of two thermostatically controlled and protected water bath evaporators. The gas will pass through pressure regulators and vacuum regulators before passing into the chlorinator room next door. The chlorinatorsA? room is also ventilated and fitted with a leak detection system.  The operation of the chlorination system including alarms will be monitored continuously by the site wide SCADA system. This can be viewed at any of the five area control panels or the centralized site control room. In the event of an emergency there are windsocks and assembly points at strategic positions and a site wide audible alarm system. Other equipment available for use by operators and maintenance staff for routine and /or emergency use include six (6) Self Contained Breathing Apparatus sets with thirteen (13) air cylinders, dedicated air compressor, five (5) portable electronic multi-gas detectors, two (2) Chlorine Institute set B drum repair kits, mobile telephones and site radios, "

      "SummaryText": "two (2) oxygen resuscitation kits, class A and B chemical hazard respond suits. Sufficient equipment for emergency response will always be identified and available to allow a response to any emergency within ten minutes. The plant will be manned continuously. At night and weekends a team of three operators will be on shift. During normal working hours, up to five operators and maintenance staff will be on site. All normal, routine operations including delivery, drum handling, connections and disconnections will be done during normal working days. All operators and select maintenance staff have received training in all aspects of chlorine operation. This includes the following courses of: Self Contained Breathing Apparatus, Confined Spaces, Lifting equipment and its use, Hazardous substances, Right to Know, Disinfection process safety, Gas control, safety shutdown and leakage control, Emergency Response Plans, Permits to work (Lockout - Tagout), Disinfection process theory and operation including drum changing, Process Operation Control and Standard Operating Procedures. These courses are supported by The Chlorine Institute literature, videos and additional chlorine vendor training.  The courses include classroom as well as extensive practical demonstrations, practice and testing. The Caribbean Water Specialist Corp training has been delivered and competency assessed by experienced and dedicated trainers and assessors. A system of refresher training practice and assessment is also in place. The company has a comprehensive written health and safety program, which includes corporate health and safety policies and identifies the organization and management of health and safety within Caribbean Water Specialist Corp.  This includes the appointment of a Safety Coordinator who coordinates the function of health and safety and chairs the company Safety Committee.  Written procedures to cover all aspects of routine and emergency operation of the chlorine installation are in "
