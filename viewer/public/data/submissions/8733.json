In fact, the Deer Park Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nOxyVinyls' policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Deer Park Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Deer Park Plant, the plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance that could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) procedures that are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyVinyls strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility by implementing reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.

The facility mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxyVinyls' goal is to minimize impacts from accidental releases should they occur.  In the event of an accidental release, the Deer Park Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the impact to the public and the environment.  The facility maintains an active Emergency Response Team that is on call at all times to respond to accidental releases of any of the hazardous chemicals handled by OxyVinyls facilities.  OxyVinyls also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office and at the facility to assistant workers, their families, and the public during and after all emergencies. In addition, OxyVinyls has a leadership role in Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA).  This is a state chartered non-profit mutual-aid cooperative combining the fire fighting, rescue, hazardous material handling and emergency medical capabilities to its members in the Houston Ship Channel area.  Participating in this organization ensures emergency response capabilities far greater than an individual plant can provide.

If the emergency extends beyond or could potentially extend beyond the plant boundaries, the Deer Park Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is notified and a statement of the type of emergency and any community protection factors are recommended.\n\nThe facility employees are active participants in the community.  As part of OxyVinyls Responsible Care. efforts, the Houston Operations had a leadership role in establishing the Citizen's Advisory Council to Deer Park industry in 1990.  The purpose of this group is to share information about plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The group meets monthly and covers topics of interest to the members including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, health issues and process safety performance.  Through this outreach effort, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays abreast of community concerns and works to address them.\n\nThe facility has implemented a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) in which employee participation at all levels is required in designing, implementing and maintaining safety programs.  Safety is a primary concern in our facility and is demonstrated by our selection by OSHA in Sept.1997 as an OSHA Star facility under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\nTo effectively implement these policies, OxyVinyls has established a management system headed by the Health, Environmental and Safety (HES) Departments to oversee safety and environmental-related activities. \n\n\n2.

The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst case scenario and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario. The Landview.

USGS maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance.\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by the Deer Park Plant:\n\n3.1 Toxic Substances - Chlorine\nThe worst-case scenario would be a catastrophic failure of one of the 250-ton chlorine storage tanks.   Since administrative controls limit the quantity of chlorine in these tanks to 225-tons, this scenario assumes 450,000 pounds of liquid chlorine is released and evaporated within a 10-minute period.  Under the EPA default worst weather conditions, the chlorine gas cloud would travel a distance of 25 miles before the concentration of chlorine diminished below 3 ppm (toxic endpoint concentration).  No credit is taken for passive or active mitigation in the analysis.  U.S. Census data indicates that approximately 2 million persons live within this distance from the storage tank.  Essentially all public-type receptors are located within this distance.  Environmental receptors within this distance include a state park and wildlife sanctuary.\n\nAn alternative release scenario selected is failure of a 1-1/2 inch loading hose connected from the liquid chlorine tank car loading header to a rail car.
