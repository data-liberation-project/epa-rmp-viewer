The Tooele Fire Department is the primary response agency to a release\n\nat this location and is trained in Hazardous Materials operations.\n\nThis facility has a flammable worst case scenario. The worst case scenario would be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the full release and ignition of a cylinder containing 116 lbs. of n-Butane.\n\nThe distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 0.04 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered rural, thus this release scenario would not likely impact any persons in a 0.04 mile radius.\n\nThis information was determined using RMP*Comp and MARPLOT software.\n\nAn alternate flammable release would be the venting of an n-Butane cylinder due to very high ambient temperatures potentially releasing 23 lbs"
