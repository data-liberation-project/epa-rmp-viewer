      "SummaryText": "The U.S. Field Artillery Center and Fort Sill in Lawton Oklahoma uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant at the installation wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and at the installation swimming pools and at two vehicle wash areas.  The concentrated form of this disinfection agent, before it is mixed with water, can be extremely hazardous if a sudden release of the vessel contents occur.  Chlorine gas is carefully stored and handled to prevent its accidental release.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) describes the chemical hazardous of chlorine gas and explains what Fort sill is doing to prevent an accidental release.  This plan has been developed and implemented in accordance with the US EPA Accidental Release Prevention Provisions regulations (40 CFR 68) and guidlines.  Fort Sill currently has two stationary subject to EPA RMP regulations:  The WWTP source area (Building 5933) and Chlorine Cylinder Storage Area (Building 5953).  The WWTP source area consists of a chlorinator that introduces chlorine gas into treated wastewater for disinfection.  As many as six 1 ton cylingers can be stored on trunnions within the enclosure of bldg. 5933.  The Fort Sill WWTP treats an estimated 2.0 million gallons of wastewater each day, and uses an average of 80 pounds of chlorine gas daily.  The storage room is equipp[ed with a ventilation system that, under normal operations, circulates fesh air throughout the building to maintain a moderate room temperature.  A chlorine detector monitors the air within the building for chlorine gas.  In the event that the concentration of chlorine gas exceeds 3 ppm, the ventilation system is automatically shut down and sealed to mitigate the rate of release from the building.  The chlorine cylinder storage area (Bldg. 5953) source area is used to store up to ninety, 150 pound chlorine cylinders.  Bldg. 5953 is used as a staging area for the cylinders, which are transported to the installation swimming pools and vechicle wash area (as an algicide) on a "
