The onsite reported substance regulated under the RMP rule is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the Griffith Energy Plant in the Chiller System.  The Chiller System is comprised of various vessels, piping, evaporators, and compressors.  Liquid ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Chiller System to enhance gas turbine performance and efficiency during warm weather conditions by cooling the turbine inlet air.\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the 5-yr update, Risk Management Professionals, Inc. completed the Hazard Assessment portion using EPA's approved dispersion modeling software, RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\nChiller System Prevention Program Safety\n\n\n\nIn addition to the regulations under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68), the Griffith Energy Plant maintains compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM) Program set forth in 29 CFR 1910.119 for its anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe following engineering and administrative controls will be in place to eliminate, or reduce the possibility of an accidental anhydrous ammonia release at the Griffith Energy facility:\n\n\n\nComputer Control System monitors and controls compressors, condenser, vessels and ammonia pumps. System displays continual operational status of equipment and controls alarms / shutdowns for out of parameter operation. High level alarm and system shut offs are installed on the recirculator and flash tank pressure vessels. Abnormal operating levels sensed in the ammonia vessels will activate a shutdown of the chiller system compressors. Pressure relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels to eliminate the potential of an over-pressure condition within the vessel"

Detection system activates visual alarms at the facility main control center to alert personnel of a possible ammonia leak in the chiller system. Preventative maintenance programs are established within the maintenance department to ensure all ammonia system components are maintained in optimum operational and mechanical condition. Continual vibration analysis of compressors and condenser fan drive shafts is provided to alert maintenance personnel of potential equipment malfunction, or failure. Ammonia system operators receive system training from outside contractors with extensive knowledge and experience with anhydrous ammonia. Mechanical Integrity audits of the chiller facility are completed annually to facilitate increased system reliability.\n\n\n\nOff Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\n40 CFR Section 68.20 (RMP), worst-case and alternative release scenario analyses were performed for this facility.  Each scenario evaluated potential offsite impacts resulting from the release of anhydrous ammonia.  Details regarding the worst-case and alternative release scenarios were provided in the appropriate RMP*eSubmit Sections. The results are also retained on file at the Griffith Energy facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nGriffith Energy's emergency plan is part of the overall facility Emergency Response Plan which establishes steps to be taken in an emergency situation. \n\n\n\nAll emergency response personnel undergo required training. Records of this training is maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the local contracted Fire Department would be called to provide assistance.\n\n\n\nMitigation\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the RMP regulations, active mitigation was not taken into consideration in determining the distance to toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario.

      "SummaryText": "er, the facility is equipped with water monitors that are strategically located around the Chiller System. Ammonia is extremely soluble in water, so the purpose of water monitors is to use high pressure water to knock down the ammonia vapors into a pool to mitigate the plume.  In a release of anhydrous ammonia, trained facility operators can activate these monitors which, when used correctly, will greatly reduce the distance to the toxic endpoint and the potentially affected population.  Thus, it should be noted that the scenarios modeled for both the worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenarios are considered conservative and unlikely.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Griffith Energy Plant has not had any RMP-reportable releases at the facility in the last five years."
