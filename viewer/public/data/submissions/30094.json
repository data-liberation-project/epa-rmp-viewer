Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at SWMN Farmers Coop in Magnolia are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We also coordinate our response efforts with the Magnolia and Luverne Fire Departments, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production. We have anhydrous ammonia stored in 1 - 30,000 gallon tank and 1 - 18,000 gallon tank at our facility in Magnolia. The maximum amount stored is 40,800 gallons (210,000#) at the maximum filling capacity of 85%.\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSWMN Farmers Coop maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the c"
