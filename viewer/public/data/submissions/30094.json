Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at SWMN Farmers Coop in Magnolia are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We also coordinate our response efforts with the Magnolia and Luverne Fire Departments, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production. We have anhydrous ammonia stored in 1 - 30,000 gallon tank and 1 - 18,000 gallon tank at our facility in Magnolia. The maximum amount stored is 40,800 gallons (210,000#) at the maximum filling capacity of 85%.\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSWMN Farmers Coop maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the c"

(Appendix D)\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively. Any findings from the hazard analysis are adddressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nSWMN Farmers Coop maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely. These procedures address various modes of operation: the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. (Appendix B)\n\nTraining\nSWMN Farmers Coop has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nSWMN Farmers Coop conductes documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief  and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. (Appendix C)\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at SWMN Farmers Coop to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are effected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nSWMN Farmers Coop routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,"

Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nSWMN Farmers Coop truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP<, particularly information resulting from the process hazard analyses.\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History\n\nSWMN Farmers Coop has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nSWMN Farmers Coop maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. (Appendix A)"
