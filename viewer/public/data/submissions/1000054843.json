Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nGrowers Ice Company - Central Coast Cooling South conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nGrowers Ice Company - Central Coast Cooling South uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. The refrigeration drawings show the facility location map, site plan and equipment layout.\n\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage, produce pre-cooling and ice generation. The refrigeration system is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system includes, one dual screw compressor package, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporative cooling coils, pressure cooling systems, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. Portable systems are one compressor skid, one half car vacuum tub"

All portable equipment are removed from the site at the end of the operational season and fixed system is shut down and all ammonia in the system is pumped down to high pressure receiver. High pressure receiver is located under shaded structure and protected by pressure relief valves and the water sprinkler system against the high pressure situations in the summer time. Vacuum tube, hydroshower and the portable compressor skid are tied to main system, while the ice generation trailer operates as a stand alone system. \n\nFacility operates seasonally from approximately April 15 through November 15. Portable refrigeration systems are brought to the site during this time only. All of the fixed refrigeration equipment except the room evaporators and pressure coolers are located outdoors. \n\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of emergency situation or any high pressure, vessel high liquid level, high temp or ammonia detection. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming. There are assigned responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\n\nThe refrigeration systems at the facility were constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 19,100 lb \n\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" in the Process Safety Information describe equipment details.\n\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are single-stage vapor compression cycles.

The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia are located in the Process Safety Information.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nGrowers Ice Company - Central Coast Cooling South maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. The Incident Investigation Program analyzes releases for ways to prevent a similar future release.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There is emergency shut-off switch inside the refrigeration operator's office for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. All of the relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient. \n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History:\n\nAccording to Growers Ice Company - Central Coast Cooling South personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries since they acquired the facility in October 2014. Facility had one small incident in 04/04/2010 due to earthquake"

The facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to Safety Coordinator, Facility Managers, and RMP administrator. \n\nThe Safety Coordinator is responsible in assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the Correction Items tables. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n"
