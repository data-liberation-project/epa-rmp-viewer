      "SummaryText": "The Turkey Valley Farms facility located in Marshall, Minnesota is a turkey (poultry) processing facility.  For this operation, products for distribution require refrigeration.  To accomplish this, the plant has an ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is contained in equipment at the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility to maintain safety storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.  The main supply of ammonia is stored in steel tanks located at various areas within the facility.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  Ammonia properties result in an efficient and effective refrigeration system while operating at reasonable pressures. Ammonia can be detected at low concentrations in the air providing an early warning for correction to potential maintenance tasks.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThe facility ammonia refrigeration system was re-activated in the 2004 - 05 period when the facility was purchase by Turkey Valley Farms following a period which the entire system was out of service.  Prior to re-activation, new equipment was installed in new and certain existing refrigerated areas and the entire refrigeration system was reviewed for integrity by a qualified refrigeration contractor.   It should be noted that previously, an accidental release prevention program has been in pl"

      "SummaryText": "ace for many years.  The original facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and was in compliance with state codes, as available during the time of construction.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program.  All of our ammonia refrigeration operators are experienced and trained in the Standard Operating Procedures.  This program also consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  \n\n\n\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \n\n?  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\n?  Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \n\n?  Most of the evaporator emergency shut off valves are located on the roof.  \n\n?  The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n\n?  A detailed process hazard review was conducted in January 2012.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The recommendations are being implemented on a time table.  \n\n?  Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\n?  For projects, a managemen"

Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\n?  The Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and  local emergency response agencies which will notify of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency action plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency action plan has been discussed with the Marshall Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response.  Representatives of the Marshal Fire Department visited this plant on an annual basis.  \n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past 5 years related to the ammonia system.  Furthermore, there have been no reportable releases at this facility in the past 8 years."
