Employees maintain a file of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for use.  They are trained in proper use of the MSDS and personnel protective equipment.  CPC hosts inspections from Regulatory Agency Inspectors, the Fire Department, the Insurance Company, and numerous other agencies regulating heating and cooling systems with related pressure vessels and valves.   New and transferred employees are trained concerning the hazards of the job site and instruction includes Hazard Communication, emergency response, and importance of reporting incidents immediately.  Training is also provided to Supervisory and Engineering personnel.  Outside Contractors are provided with an overview of working conditions and safety practices to be used prior to commencement of work at the facility.  The facility has full sprinkler system protection, with monitors and alarms as feasible. CPC is undergoing a seismic retrofit as a result of a seismic assessment for the property location, equipment and buildings.  New equipment continues to be installed to improve the refrigeration system.  The propane system was installed in about 1971.  As the equipment is repaired, new bracing and parts conforming to current standards and codes are being used. \n\n1.2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n(1) Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nCPC uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant, for processing, storing and preserving pork products.  Two separate refrigeration systems contain approximately 6,700 gallons total of anhydrous ammonia distributed among compressors, condensers, vessels, evaporators, and piping.  \n\nThe ammonia is utilized as a high pressure/low pressure gas/liquid and has a pressure temperature range within the system of 10 in/Hg @ -40 degrees F to 160 psig @ 88 degrees F.

      "SummaryText": "a at (160 psig) is allowed to expand to 15 psig within the coils of a heat exchanger (evaporator, votators, chillers).  This process absorbs heat from the product in the room or water in a chiller.  The low-pressure super-saturated gas is then returned to the engine room to be compressed and condensed to its liquid state to be reused (see Figure 1-3 Simplified Refrigeration System Flow Chart). The compressors, condensers and high-pressure receiver vessels are located in both North and South Engine Rooms.  Evaporators, chillers and low pressure accumulator vessels are utilized in the cooler boxes and production areas throughout the facility buildings.\n\n(2) Propane System\n\nThe Propane System consists of two 30,000-gallon tanks, which can be run separately, a vapor air system, a pump with an explosion-proof motor, and associated piping.  A concrete/block wall encloses the tanks with vent holes at the base of the wall.  The wall is 6-feet high.  The entire tank area is protected by a deluge-type sprinkler system.  The propane system is utilized in two ways.\n\nThe system was installed in accordance with an agreement with the Southern California Gas Company (SCGC) in the late 1971 to 1973 period, to provide Stand-by fuel for the plant boilers.  Upon notification by the SCGC, procedures are initiated to shut down the gas to the boilers and power them instead with propane.  This generally occurs during particularly cold weather, when gas usage peaks.  \n\nSteam from the boilers is used to heat the vapor air system to 150( to 160(.  Once that temperature range is achieved, liquid propane is introduced through a 2-inch pipeline and the gas is shut off.  The heat converts the liquid to gas.  There are four guns or regulators that are pressure sensitive, increasing and decreasing the propane feed to the boilers, based upon the steam demand in plant processing.\n\nThe tanks are recharged as needed by various suppliers. The propane is delivered in tank trucks.  The drivers hook up"

The frequency of recharging the tanks depends primarily on the frequency of standby use.  The system is rarely called on for stand-by and has not required a recharge of propane in over a year.\n\nThe more common use of propane at the facility is fueling the forklifts.  Liquid Propane is pumped into 5-gallon fuel tanks using the pump and a hose.  The Vapor Air System is not required for this operation.  There is one trained employee, under the supervision of the Mechanical Superintendent, who performs that tank-filling task. Access to the filling area is limited.  The area is fenced and the gate is locked. The Superintendent, the trained worker, and plant security have keys.\n\n1.3\tOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis was performed using population information, sensitive receptors such as schools, hospitals, recreation areas, and convalescent centers. A worst-case scenario model was run and studied to determine how far the hazardous material was likely to go in the surrounding areas should it be accidentally released into the atmosphere.  For ammonia, the worst-case scenario involved the release of 15,000 pounds into the environment, from the one high-pressure receiver.  In this case, the worst-case scenario estimated distance to toxic endpoint is approximately 1.46 miles. The estimated population within the affected radius would be 14,627 people.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a propane release involved the release of 30,000-gallons from the pressurized storage tank.  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint, according to the model run, would be 0.478 square miles.  The estimated population within the circle is 1,043 people.\n\nThe alternate scenario chosen for modeling of a propane release involved the release of 4040 gallons of propane from damaged overhead piping.  A working crane causes the damage with a heated engine, which provides an ignition sour"

In order to insure that equipment is monitored on a timely and orderly fashion, that any necessary repairs or negative deviation situations are resolved as promptly as possible by knowledgeable professionals, CPC employs a full time staff whose function is maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The team consists of (1) the Plant Engineer, (2) the Maintenance Superintendent, (3) the Lead Man-Operating Engineer, and (4) a Maintenance Engineer.  \n\nInspections and Audits\n\nIn addition to other specified inspection and audit programs mentioned in this section, the Safety Director and his team conduct a monthly facility Walk-Through Inspection which is part of the new CMMS program.  The CMMS Safety Route includes a departmental review of fire extinguishers, and will include other emergency equipment such as self-contained breathing apparatus, and chemical suits.  Observations are recorded on an Inspection form and deviations are noted and forwarded to the appropriate department for correction.  The Safety Director, or designated representative performs follow-up inspections to assure that corrective action is taken in a timely manner.  Inspection documentation is maintained in file in the Human Resources office.\n\nThe maintenance engineers conduct daily inspections on the compressors, pressure gauges, and watch for AHM or oil leaks, oil level, discharge temperature, suction temperature and oil temperature.  Also inspected daily are the temperature of condensers, pump leaks, vibration; inspectors check the dump pots and valve operation, the accumulators solenoid valves, and they inspection receivers and evaporators, \n\nIn addition to internal self-audits and"

The written plan includes evacuation procedures and employees have been trained in ERP activities. Copies of the evacuation plan are located in several areas of the plant.The ERP insures that supervisory personnel on each shift are trained in Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), first aid and basic fire fighting techniques.  Security personnel are also trained in CPR and first aid.The bilingual (Spanish and English) evacuation procedures (see Clougherty Packing Company - Evacuation Procedures, Figure 2-2)  and muster areas are thoroughly reviewed during the employee's orientation training and are posted in each department.Evacuation drills are conducted on a rotating departmental basis throughout the year, with a goal of two evacuation drills per department per year (see Figure 2-3).  Beginning in 1994 there will be a full plant evacuation conducted annually.  Drills are carefully audited and evaluated to assure that any noted deficiencies in the plan are corrected.  When evacuation of either the  full  facility or a portion thereof is required, notice is made by public address system, horn, two-way radio, bull horns, telephones (landline or mobile), or a combination of these methods.Employees leave the premises and proceed to the designated muster area where a head count is made by the supervisor or his representative.
