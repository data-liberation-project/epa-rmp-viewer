Topeka MSB Plant (Reser's Topeka MSB) refrigeration systems use pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant.  Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by the EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Reser's Topeka MSB to be compliant with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \r\n\r\n1.1.2.\tSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\n1.1.3.\tWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with state and federal regulations.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Action provisions.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\n1.2.\tFacility Description and Substances Handled\r\n\r\n1.2.1.\tReser's Topeka MSB is a food manufacturing facility that stores and distributes refrigerated foods.  Production requires the use of two conjoined separate refrigeration systems (North Bistro and South Bistro) to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees only. Management personnel, visitors and contractors are accompanied by trained personnel o"

(South Bistro 48462lbs, North Bistro 16402.4lbs). There is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\r\n\r\n1.3.\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario (South Bistro is the larger system)\r\n\r\n1.3.1.\tRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 2.01), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the Marplot Map Server.  This system was used to estimate the residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  \r\n\r\n1.3.2.\tWorst-Case Scenario.  Catastrophic failure of the High-Pressure Receiver located at South Bistro, outside the compressor room, when filled to the greatest amount would release 12,619 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario presumes that the entire contents are released.  \r\n\r\n1.3.3.\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 2.2 miles from the point of release.  This distance extends beyond the facility fence line and would encompass an estimated population of 26,282.  Within this distance, there are many school, parks, and multiple businesses inside the release zone.\r\n\r\n1.3.4.\tThis worst-case scenario would not likely occur unless an act of nature (e.g., earthquake) by physically compromising the tank. The structural integrity of the tank is safeguarded by periodic inspection for mechanical integrity to prevent a rupture due to tank degradation.  The tank is also safeguarded from rupture from over-pressurization.  It is a rated pressure vessel hydro-tested to 325 psi and equipped with 250 psi pressure"

During high demand, the High-Pressure Receiver may only be filled to a fraction (~30%) of capacity.  In addition, predominant winds are significantly stronger than input into the modeling program, helping to dispense the vapors more rapidly.  The worst-case weather scenarios are uncommon.  \r\n\r\n1.4.\tAlternative Scenario. (South Bistro)\r\n\r\n1.4.1.\tSeveral alternative scenarios can generate the equivalent of a 1 opening in a high-pressure liquid line.  Alternative scenarios could include an opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, or a pressure relief valve release.  This scenario presumes a release duration of 10 minutes resulting in a loss of 1,260 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario was selected because a release of this type would occur outdoors resulting in the highest potential exposure to offsite receptors.\r\n\r\n1.4.2.\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.8 miles from the point of release.  This distance extends beyond the facility fence line and would encompass an estimated population of 2,965 with the closest residence and schools inside the release zone.  \r\n\r\n1.4.3.\tThe severity of release from this scenario would likely be less since safety system provisions are in place to limit the release duration to less than ten minutes using appropriately placed isolation valves.  In addition, predominant winds are significantly stronger than input into the modeling program, helping to dispense the vapors more rapidly and effectively reducing the distance to toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\n1.5.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\n\r\n1.5.1.\tReser's Topeka MSB complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.
