Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Runkle's Fertilizer Service, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and emergency response teams so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quanitity stored would be 95,333 pounds in the facility's two permanent storage tanks.  The capacity of each tank is 47,667 pounds.\n3.The Worst-Case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 47,667 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance of dispersion based on the model used is 2.2 miles. \nThe Alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose, with 26,638 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.7 miles.\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities.  These Regulations are administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture.\n5.  The Five-year Accident History:  The following is a list of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have occurred from the covered process:\nMarch 23, 1995; a total of approximately 3739"

The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has provided state and local authorities with emergency and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response information has been provided to the local fire department and emergency response team.\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility. Evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
