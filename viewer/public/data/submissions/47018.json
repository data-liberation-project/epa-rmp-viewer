Describe the accident release prevention and emergency policies\n\nIt is the intent of Dreyer's Ice Cream Company to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment. Dreyer's Ice Cream Company will also comply with all federal, state, and local laws. The Plant Manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key components in the plant safety and health program. Dreyer's Ice Cream Company exercises many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, emergency air washing systems, ammonia spill holding containment systems, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to upsets in the system.\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\n \n\n\nB.    Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nDreyer's Ice Cream Company Bakersfield Plant produces ice cream products for sale to the public. The facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems to freeze ice cream products and also to operate the plant air-conditioning.   Since the two ammonia refrigeration systems have interconnected piping they are considered a single process.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the Bakersfield plant, in reference to this RMP submittal.\n\n\nC.    Description of the accidental release preventi"
