The valves are designed to close automatically either on command or when there is a power loss to the building.\n\nProcedures:\nCity Utilities\u00bf written operating and maintenance procedures manual addresses the safe handling of chlorine cylinders.  The manual draws extensively on CU\u00bfs safe handling experience as well as on guidance from professional organizations such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the Chlorine Institute.  A proper respect for the chemical, adequate knowledge of chemical properties, proper use of tools, and good communication between employees are all important to accident prevention.  These and other issues are addressed in the written procedures for the Blackman Treatment Plant.\n\nTraining:\nCU provides chlorine safety training to all employees involved in operating and maintaining the Blackman Plant.  The training centers around the specific procedures outlined in the plant chlorine procedures manual, and is augmented by additional material from AWWA and other outside sources.  This training occurs at the time an employee is assigned to Water Treatment and is repeated biennially.  Blackman employees also receive extensive training in chemical emergency response.  The training involves general mitigation techniques, such as how to deploy a valve repair kit, as well as specific aspects of the Blackman HazMat emergency response plan.  City Utilities has shared our expertise for many years by providing training programs in chlorine safety and response to other water utilities and civil authorities.  We also cooperate with these entities in providing training opportunities, including joint exercises, under the OSHA/EPA HazWOPER program.\n\nFive-year chemical safety record:\nCity Utilities has not experienced a chemical accident at either of its drinking water facilities in the past five years.

      "SummaryText": "Introduction:\nThe Blackman Water Treatment Plant provides drinking water to the metropolitan area of Springfield Missouri.  The plant is located at 2601 South Blackman Road.  Important steps in the water treatment process include taste and odor control, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, chlorination, pH adjustment, and fluoridation.  Some of these steps require the addition of chemicals such as powdered activated carbon, potassium permanganate, polyaluminum chloride polymer, chlorine, fluoride, and soda ash.\n\nThis plan centers on the use of chlorine at the Blackman Plant.  Chlorine is a yellow-green gas with a bleach-like odor.  It is used extensively as a disinfectant in public drinking water, swimming pools, and cooling water systems due to its ability to react with easily oxidizable compounds.  Bacteria, viruses, and other harmful organisms are effectively deactivated by disrupting their biochemical processes.  Chlorine gas is added to the raw water during the treatment process and to the finished water prior to distribution.  Unlike many disinfectants, chlorine stays in the water providing residual protection as it travels through the distribution system.\n\nChlorine workers must take special precautions to prevent the gas from escaping.  In its vapor form the oxidant can attack skin, eye, and lung tissues.  The resulting damage can be serious, irreversible, and even fatal at high concentrations.  The potential hazard is greatest in the immediate working area near the gas cylinders; but in a large-scale release the gas could disperse and pose an exposure risk to people and property near the plant grounds.  City Utilities has never experienced such an event involving any chemicals at this facility.\n\nAccident Prevention:\nCity Utilities has an effective chlorine safety program.  The key components include contingency planning, on-site monitoring, emergency shutoff equipment, and specialized operation and maintenance procedures.  A strong emphasis"

For many years CU has been called upon to share expertise and training techniques with local fire departments and other water utilities in the region.\n\nPlanning:\nThe Blackman hazardous materials (HazMat) emergency response plan covers all chemicals used at the facility.  This plan addresses accident scenarios during normal operating hours, nights, and weekends.  The plan is integrated with the Greene County Emergency Management response plan.  The plan is updated as needed to account for organizational changes and is completely reevaluated every three years.\n\nMonitoring:\nChlorine is added to the water from a central storage and injection system located in a totally enclosed and fireproof building situated over 800 feet from the closest property boundary.  It is equipped with a gas detection and monitoring system that operates on two levels of safety.  The first monitor senses chlorine gas inside the enclosure to warn workers before entering.  The second monitoring stage can detect a release that escapes the building.  It consists of an array of six chlorine detectors situated around the perimeter of the structure.  An alarm from any of these monitors would warn plant personnel, by warning light and bell, (or the plant security officer during unstaffed hours), of the potential for an uncontrolled release.  This is one of the mechanisms that would activate the plant emergency response plan.  The information from these perimeter monitors would indicate the direction and extent of chlorine drift and dispersion.  This information would be valuable to civil authorities in determining whether the release posed a threat to people living or working nearby.\n\nShutoff valves:\nInside the chlorine containment building, each cylinder is equipped with an emergency shutoff valve.  These valves may be activated remotely by the Plant Operator to stop the flow of chlorine if the monitors detect a continuous release.  This could prevent a pr"

The Water Treatment Department is distinguished by the fact that it has never experienced a lost time injury.  This record encompasses over 46 years of public ownership.  The Water Treatment employees are deservedly proud of this distinction, and intend to make a concerted effort to keep it intact well into the future.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Blackman HazMat emergency response plan can be activated either through the monitoring and alarm system noted above or by human detection.  In either case, the plan calls for immediate notification of the appropriate public response agencies.\n\nResponse personnel:\nSmall chlorine leaks can be repaired immediately by properly trained and equipped Blackman personnel.  However, leaks judged to be large enough for potential off-sire consequences are assigned to the Springfield Fire Department HazMat response team. The City developed this local response capability, with substantial input from City Utilities, to ensure a fully staffed and equipped response team around the clock.  During a Fire Department response, some Blackman employees would be deployed to help monitor off-site vapor dispersion and contain any chlorine-laden runoff.\n\nLocal evacuation:\nThe response plan calls for all plant employees not involved in response activities to evacuate the facility using their own vehicles and reassembling at a designated point in the neighboring community.  The specific assembly point would depend on the wind direction at the time of the event.\n\nGeneral area evacuation:\nIn an event with potential off-site impacts, the neighboring community would either be evacuated or instructed to implement in-place sheltering at the discretion of the Fire Department.  Evacuation or sheltering operations would be directed by the Greene County Sheriff\u00bfs office.  This agency is authorized to issue evacuation orders und"

All routes are capable of handling high volume traffic.\n\nConclusion:\nCity Utilities places a high priority on the need to safely handle all chemicals at all locations, including the Blackman Water Treatment Plant.  This responsibility is heightened as we watch urban and suburban development move toward the originally rural plant site.  CU is proud of the plant safety record, both with respect to chemical usage and general work practices.  We are confident in the monitoring systems, shutoff mechanisms, and response plans that make up a tiered protection plan for our employees and our neighbors.  We will continue to work with local response agencies and government regulators to ensure that all parties maintain this high level of vigilance for the safety of our community."
