Contractors-On occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Univar USA Inc has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental relaese of a regulated substance occur.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  Univar USA Inc has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only one minor accidental release (>3 lbs) of Ammonium (conc 20% or greater) has occurred during this period, and that was in 1999..\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN:  Univar USA Inc is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with tthe processes at our facillty.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the local Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nUnivar USA Inc carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency"

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  Our facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Repackaging, Storage & Distribution.  We have two RMP-regulated substances stored above threshold limits:  Ammonium Hydroxide; Cyclohexylamine.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO:  The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a RMP substance in inventory onsite.  The RMP liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of 1 cm height, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes by using Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed.  For each Alternate Release Scenario onsite Emergency Response Personnel and Equipment were considered for active mitigation.  The Worse Case Scenario release of 39400 lbs of Ammonium (conc 20% or greater) resulted in the maximum distance of .3 miles to the toxic endpoint.  The Alternate Case Scenarios involved both RMP-regulated substances stored above threshold limits and resulted in the maximum distance of .1 miles to the toxic endpoint using Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA including:  1. Safety Information-Univar USA Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  2. Hazard Review-Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.
