Auditing, investigating incidents and taking corrective measures to prevent future mishaps are the tools used to maintain our programs.

These PMs are monitored annually by our corporate Engineering Department.  In addition to the monitoring of the PM's, Corporate annually have the Health, Safety and Environmental departments conduct audits.  These audits are in addition to departmental monthly audits.\r\n                                                                                                                           \r\n Prior to start-up a pre-start check of equipment is conducted by the employees and during a pour the computer system monitors chemical flow and if a flow problem is detected the system shuts down.  In addition to the hardware monitoring the pouring team monitors the process closely and if a problem arises then they can take the appropriate action to prevent a release.
