      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan covers the Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's Walker Creek Distribution Center in Camp County, TX.  The facility's refrigeration system is a standard two-stage refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in the system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy follow the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (\"one plan\") and is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of two ammonia release scenarios identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternate release scenario\".  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Pilgrims Pride Walker Creek Distribution Center involves a failure of the High Pressure Receiver under maximum storage conditions.  The computer program, RMP*Comp, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  This scenario was performed using pre-define"

The EPA-mandated meteorological conditions used for this scenario were Atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (77? F), and average humidity (50%).  \n\nThe EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n1. Under normal operating conditions, this High Pressure Receiver contains less than the maximum storage capacity and would seldom, if ever, reach the maximum capacity.\n\n2. Assumption is that ammonia liquefied under pressure is released at its boiling point.  At true atmospheric conditions only a fraction (about 20% of the total) of the liquid ammonia will release to the atmosphere flashing as a vapor.  The remaining un-flashed liquid will stay in the vessel or pool on the ground.\n\n3. Requirement to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard.\n\n4. Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6% of the area of the full circle.\n\n5. Worst case weather conditions are extremely uncommon.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of a ammonia due to a pipe leak at the pump.  The scenario, by definition, is \"more likely to occur\" than the worst case scenario and must reach an endpoint off site using the typical meteorological conditions of Atmospheric Stability Class D, wind speed of 3.0 m/s, average air temperature of 77?F and 50% average humidity.  The scenario we chose to evaluate does reach offsite endpoints and a few nearby public receptors.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporat"

Line Break procedures\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrims Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.  They were also instrumental in developing the Process Safety Information.  All anhydrous ammonia pipes and valves are labeled and all equipment information has been compiled.  The Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system, as required under the RMP regulations.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and respirators for the refrigeration partners' use, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.  We also give our refrigeration partners HAZMAT training on an annual basis.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, the Company performs periodical audits and hazard reviews to enhance continued safe performance.  Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked on a monthly basis for timely completion as required.\n\nThe Pilgrim's Pride Walker Creek Distributio"
