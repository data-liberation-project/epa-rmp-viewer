The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in each system is summarized below:\n\n\n\nHigh Pressure Receivers\n\nThe purpose of each high pressure receiver is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration systems. Each high pressure receiver receives high pressure liquid from the condensers and supplies high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration and liquid recirculators. Each high pressure receiver is also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in each process at any given moment. Each high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout each system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlooded Accumulators\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the low pressure receiver.

Each intercooler is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the intercoolers contain low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nSubcooler\n\nThe subcooler receives and subcools liquid from the high pressure receiver in order to supply subcooled liquid to the liquid recirculator. The subcooler is a heat exchanger that uses a supply of low temperature ammonia to cool high pressure liquid ammonia. On the low temperature side, the subcooler is equipped with an expansion valve which expands high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the heat exchanger. On the high pressure side, high pressure liquid is piped from the high pressure receiver and into spiral piping inside the subcooler. The low pressure liquid in the vessel absorbs heat from the high pressure liquid in the spiral piping. The subcooled high pressure liquid exits the subcooler and is supplied to the liquid recirculator. Under normal conditions, the subcooler contains low and high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nLow Temperature Recirculators\n\nThe purpose of each low temperature recirculator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid that can be used in low temperature evaporators throughout the facility.

The oil pots receive liquid ammonia and oil from the recirculators, intercoolers, or low pressure receiver and vent ammonia vapor back to each associated vessel. The oil pots are equipped with spring-return oil drain valves which are used to drain oil from the systems as needed. Under normal conditions, the oil pots contain low pressure liquid ammonia, low pressure vapor ammonia, and refrigerant oil.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates.

The shell and tube heat exchanger receives liquid from a flooded accumulator where it is contained within the shell of the heat exchanger and surrounds the tubes containing secondary coolant. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the shell and tube heat exchanger and is returned to the flooded accumulator. Under normal conditions, the shell and tube heat exchanger contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nLow Pressure Receiver\n\nThe purpose of the low pressure receiver is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The low pressure receiver receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and recirculators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the low pressure receiver drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel.

The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the low pressure receiver, intercooler, or recirculator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nEvaporative Condensers\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Wawona Frozen Foods facility are an integral part of the overall business and operates year round. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Eme"

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Wawona Frozen Foods has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Wawona Frozen Foods now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Wawona Frozen Foods employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Wawona Frozen Foods will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n\n"
