If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the following agencies: Hutchinson County LEPC, Texas Commission on Environmental Quanlity, and the local fire and police departments.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: This facility is a petroleum products transportation facility, that receives refined product from Borger Refinery via pipeline. There are three bullet-type storage tanks located at this facility - two that store butane (not open to atmosphere) and one transmix tank. The transmix tank serves as a surge vessel for contaminated products, including product that is drained for maintenance activities; the tank also serves as a liquid knockout vessel for the terminal's relief system.  Also located at the terminal are eleven (11) dehydrator towers that contain an alumina dessicant. \r\n\r\n \r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS: The worst case scenario was considered to be the complete and immediate failure of the largest vessel containing a flammable material.   The only flammable material at this facility which meets the EPA RMP threshold level is butane.  The maximum amount of butane stored in any one vessel at the facility is 82,860 pounds.  The distance to the flammable worst-case endpoint was calculated to be 0.4 miles.    There are no public receptors within the 0.4 mile radius of concern for the flammable worst case scenario.  This is a Program 1 facility which does not require an alternative case scenario.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: This facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management rule, DOT RSPA and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The butane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with EPA, DOT and state laws.\r\n\r\nFIVE-"

This policy has been discussed with the fire department so that they may render assistance as necessary.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: None"
