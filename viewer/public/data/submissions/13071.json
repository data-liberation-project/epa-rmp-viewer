This plan complies with the policy of providing a safe work environment for all employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors.  It extends to the design, training and implementation of a comprehensive emergency management program that saves lives and reduces property damage in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nPrevention is the primary goal.  However if an emergency should ever occur, the immediate goal is to contain the emergency and its effects within facility boundaries, mitigate the incident as quickly as possible and prevent any threat to the general public and neighbors.  It is Enron Methanol Company's policy to operate in an environmentally responsible manner consistent with environmental knowledge, policy and regulation that best serves the needs of the employees, community and the company.  Life preservation is the prime consideration, so all procedures will be carried out in a manner to minimize risk to employees and emergency response personnel.  Rescue and medical activities have priority over all other actions. \n\n\nThe Enron Methanol Company plant produces methanol from natural gas.  The process produces a syngas containing hydrogen and methane. Hydrogen and methane do not individually meet the threshold quantity requirements; however, the syngas mixture does and is therefore regulated as a flammable mixture under RMP.  Syngas is produced and consumed within the process and is not stored in significant quantities.  Finished methanol is not regulated under the RMP rules.  \n\nThis facility has no substantial amount of any toxic materials that are covered by this regulation. \n\n\nA worst case scenario is designed to be a theoretical exercise which calculates the potential impact on the community based upon extreme conditions p"

Enron Methanol Company uses modern maintenance practices, tools and systems to keep equipment operating reliably and detect repair needs in their early stages.  To improve equipment reliability, Enron Methanol Company conducts mechanical integrity inspections and failure analysis to determine the root cause of failures.  Qualified personnel who have been trained in plant maintenance procedures maintain the plant.  A Management of Change system controls changes to equipment and procedures.\n\n\nThere has been one incident at Enron Methanol Company in the last 5 years that meets the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) reporting requirements:\n\nOn October 12, 1994, an explosion occurred at the facility.  Community effects included road closures, shelter in place orders and black smoke.  The number of people affected in the community was estimated at 500 based on reports published after the explosion.  Only minor injuries were reported.  During the seven month period following the incident, the facility was rebuilt using the latest available technology.  Several vessels were removed or replaced with smaller vessels resulting in a smaller process inventory.  The revisions include an upgraded plant control system and monitoring capabilities.\n\n\nThe Emergency Planning and Response plan consists of four elements: prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.  \n\nPrevention is supported by policies and procedures intended to assure the plant is operated in a safe manner.  Inspections and audits of practices assure that the policies and procedures are being followed.  Periodic reviews of the procedures and training serve to reinforce the importance of operating the plant in a safe manner.\n\nPreparedness includes development of emergency procedures, obtaining and installing emergency equipment and notification devices, development and training of a plant emergency response team, coordinatio"
