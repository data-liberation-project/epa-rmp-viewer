OSI's Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at OSI; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. OSI is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is OSI policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility's Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, an"

Facility Identification\n\nThe OSI facility is located at 711 Industrial Drive in West Chicago, Illinois. The facility processes ground beef specialties. The NAICS code for the processes at the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\n\n\n\nOSI West Chicago Plant is a food processing facility that runs a continuous operation. OSI utilizes a regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, for refrigeration. Two closed loop refrigeration systems are required to freeze the produced product and maintain the facility's temperature. The two systems are interconnected through a pump out line.\n\n\n\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A.\n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed throughout this document OSI is continuously improving this program. \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was conducted on August 20, 2015, and the next audit will occur bef"

The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - OSI has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - OSI maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - OSI has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. OSI completed a thorough PHA revalidation study for the ammonia refrigeration systems on March 6, 2014.\n\n?    Operating Procedures - OSI has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.    \n\n?    Training - OSI has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\n\n?    Management of Change - OSI has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except "

Pre-Startup Review - OSI has developed a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity - OSI has updated a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  \n\n?    Contractor Qualifications - OSI has developed a site-specific contractor qualification procedure that ensures all contract employers' safety performance and programs are evaluated, a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained, information of potential hazards are communicated between OSI and the contract employer, and required training and information is communicated, such as the provisions of the emergency action plan and control over entrance into process areas.\n\n?    Incident Investigation - OSI has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure will also make provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n\n?
