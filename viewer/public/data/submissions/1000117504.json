Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents and operating procedures, participation in Process Hazard Analyses (PHA), and periodic employee training.  TNBO has an employee participation plan that documents many other ways employees are involved in accident prevention and process safety.\nTNBO has a comprehensive PSM program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this system, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nTNBO has well-established mechanical integrity practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems.\nTraining of plant personnel includes: (1) an overview of the pro"

Trammo North Bend Operations (TNBO) produces nitric acid and aqua ammonia solution.  Additionally, TNBO ships anhydrous ammonia and Urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) without being processed.  \nAmmonia is the precursor chemical for most of the processes that take place on site.  Anhydrous ammonia is brought to the site by rail, truck or barge and stored in a low-pressure storage tank.  The ammonia is vaporized and oxidized over a Platinum metal gauze at high temperature and pressure.  This creates NOx gas that is then absorbed into water in two absorbing towers in succession.  The NOx absorbed into the water creates nitric acid.  The nitric acid is sold out of the facility in a number of different concentrations depending on customer specifications.  \nAqua ammonia (aqua) is made by absorbing anhydrous ammonia into water.  Aqua is used in many different applications, such as emission reduction.\nThe facility receives UAN by barge and stores it in two atmospheric tanks. The UAN can be shipped at various concentrations by dilution at the truck rack. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nAs part of the management system for Process Safety Management (PSM), a plant wide computer system is utilized to control maintenance and process safety functions. Computers located in easily accessible locations are used to access plant files such as P&ID drawings, operating procedures, Management of Change (MOC), and other pertinent documents.  This system is used to provide our employees with the necessary tools and records for process safety requirements.  It plays an integral part in the safety efforts of the plant. In addition, plant personnel routinely participate in monthly safety meetings.\nEach employee is trained ann"

This system requires that process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards.  The MOC system verifies that existing controls have not been compromised.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, drawings, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all effected personnel receive training on the change.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of any chemicals for the covered processes at this facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThis facility has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) regulated by OSHA under 29 CFR \u00a71910.38. The EAP includes the following elements:\n\u0095\tFire and emergency reporting procedures.\n\u0095\tEvacuation procedures and emergency escape route assignments.\n\u0095\tProcedures for employees who remain to operate critical operations before evacuating.\n\u0095\tProcedures to account for all personnel after evacuation.\n\u0095\tProcedures for employees performing rescue or medical duties.\n\u0095\tPersons to be contacted for further information about the Plan.\nThe EAP outlines response actions to be taken during abnormal operations and emergencies that present danger, real or potential, to human health or the environment at the facility.
