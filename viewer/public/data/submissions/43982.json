      "SummaryText": "VWR International (VWR) is a distributor of high-quality chemicals and laboratory supplies.  The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers (typically ranging from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single ?covered process? for regulatory purposes.  The VWR facility is considered to be covered under the Program 2 eligibility requirements (per 68.10(c)) because VWR is not covered by one of the SIC codes listed under Program 3 nor OSHA?s Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nAt the present time, hydrochloric acid solution (>36%) exceeds the Threshold Quantity (TQ) for that substance under the revised New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJ TCPA) with a maximum quantity in 2003 of 13,000 lbs. as compared to the NJ TCPA TQ of 5,600 lbs.  Additionally VWR has had a maximum of 18,000 lbs. of chloroform and anticipates that it may exceed the TQ for that substance of 20,000 lbs. even though at most times it will be below that.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a hypothetical incident in which the single largest container stored at the site, a 200 liter metal drum, is pierced by a fo"

RMP Comp, a software program furnished by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was used to determine the farthest distance from the facility that toxic effects may be anticipated, following the chemical release.  This is known as the ?toxic? endpoint.\n\nResults of the worst-case analysis indicate that all distances to the endpoints are relatively small.  The estimated distance to the toxic for hydrochloric acid was determined to be 0.7 miles.  The worst-case distance for chloroform was less than one tenth (0.1) of a mile.  There are no residences, schools, hospitals or environmentally sensitive areas within that distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a more realistic hypothetical incident in which a single one-gallon (approximately 4 liter) container is dropped on the floor.   According to the analysis, the distance to the toxic endpoint was also equal to one-tenth of a mile (0.1 mile) or less for both hydrochloric acid and chloroform.\n\nAdministrative controls and active mitigation measures were not included as a factor of consideration during the worst case or alternative release scenarios.  However, both release scenarios considered indoor releases contained by dikes or berms in the flammable storage room.\n\nVWR?s prevention program consists of several key elements, including:\n?    Safety Information ? includes detailed information about the hazards of the regulated chemicals, maximum intended inventory, facility design features, applicable standards, equipment use and maintenance.\n\n?    Hazard Review ? a process of evaluating facility operations, using warehouse industry checklists, to identify and control potential hazards.\n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures ? written SOP?s to guide employees in safety conducting normal, temporary and non-routine/emergency operations.\n\n?    Training ? includes training commensurate with the types of activities employees are expe"

      "SummaryText": "cted to perform during normal and emergency situations.\n\n?    Maintenance ? required maintenance activities are performed by trained employees or qualified workers.\n\n?    Compliance Audits ? conducted at least once every three years to verify compliance with regulatory requirements for Accidental Release Prevention.\n\n?    Incident Investigation ? conducted whenever an incident occurs that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release (i.e., a release that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment).\n\nThe need for chemical specific prevention steps is very limited because chemicals are contained within sealed DOT-approved containers, and the containers are not opened during handling.  Additionally, all chemicals are segregated and stored by hazard class to ensure that incompatible chemicals are not stored together.\n\nThere have been no accidents in the previous five years that have resulted in any deaths or significant property damage on-site, or any off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering from regulated substances or otherwise.  However, VWR has developed a comprehensive emergency response program that addresses small and large-scale incidents, including coordination with outside agencies and responders.  This plan has been approved by the State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection under its Discharge Prevention, Containment and Countermeasures (DPCC) and Discharge Cleanup & Removal (DCR) Plan requirements."
