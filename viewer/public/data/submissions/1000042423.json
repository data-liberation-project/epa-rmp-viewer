They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  We at the Robert A. Weese Water Treatment Plant (Weese WTP) use chemicals, too.  For example, we use chlorine and aqueous ammonia to disinfect our water supply to provide a safe drinking water to our customers.  Storing large quantities of chlorine and aqueous ammonia can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using these chemicals as seriously as we take providing the public safe disinfected water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure safety, and what to do in event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n1.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe City of Oceanside and the Weese WTP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\n\r\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  Weese WTP has one chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers and an aqueous ammonia system that provides a small amount of ammonia in the water to limit the formation of possible harmful disinfection by-products.  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal response, procedures, and ongoing"

      "SummaryText": "actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine or aqueous ammonia to the environment.  Weese WTP has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.  This plan will be reviewed by the San Diego County Hazardous Material Division (HMD), which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  To date, we have an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\r\n\r\n1.3  General Facility and Regulated Substances Information\r\n\r\nThe Weese WTP is located at 3885 Silverleaf Lane in Vista, California in rural San Diego County.  Owned and operated by the City of Oceanside, it consists of a 25-million-gallon-per-day (mgd) water filtration plant.  The filtration plant finishes raw water that is supplied by either the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California or the State Project.  \r\n\r\nThe processes at Weese WTP include:\r\n\u00b7 Flash mixing\r\n\u00b7 Flocculation\r\n\u00b7 Filtration\r\n\u00b7 Chlorination\r\n\u00b7 Chloramination\r\n\r\nThe facility currently stores chlorine and aqueous ammonia (24.5 percent), both regulated toxic substances.  Chlorine is used for the chlorination of the plant effluent in the Chlorine Contact Tank.  Gaseous chlorine is drawn from the storage vessel as a gas and injected into the water.  Prior to discharging the treated water into the distribution system, aqueous ammonia is injected into the chlorinated water to convert the residual chlorine to chloramines.  \r\n\r\nChlorine is stored in 10 1-ton storage containers in the chlorine building, where the chlorine process is located.  This chlorine storage exceeds the minimum threshold planning quantities in the PSM, RMP, and CalARP Rules. \r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia is stored in a 6500 gallon tank (49,300 pounds of aqueous ammonia) which exceeds the California threshold planning quantity.  \r\n\r\n1.4  Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\n\r\nThe Weese WTP is in compliance with Feder"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine or aqueous ammonia release, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\r\n\r\n1.6  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe safety of the chlorine and aqueous ammonia processes were reviewed initially in 1999 and revalidated in 2004, 2009, and 2014 in the process hazard analysis.  Based on these reviews, additional changes were identified to improve the safety of the chlorination and chloramination systems.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the covered processes.\r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the City employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of full face respirators, worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine and ammonia deliveries; awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and ammonia; and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine leak detector monitors continuously for leaks in the in the chlorine storage room.  The leak detectors are set to alarm at 0.5 ppm.  At 0.5 ppm, an alarm is activated in the control room, and audible and visual lights are activated inside and outside the chlorination building.  In addition to the audible and visual alarms to alert operators near the chlorine building, the central computer sends an alarm to all SCADA monitors, the scrubber is activated and the vent fan is locked out. All 1-ton chlorine containers are equipped with fusible metal type safety relief devices, called fusible plugs.  Most 1-ton containers have six fusible plugs, three at each end, spaced 120 degrees apart.  In the event of a fire or other high temperatures, the fusible plug is designed to melt between 158\u00b0F and 165\u00b0F to relieve pressure and prevent a catastrophic rupture of the container.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an aqueous ammonia leak, where the chemical will drain into the containment berm and into the floor drain system, plant staff would suspend recovery of backwash water.  (The terminus of the floor drain system in the chemical storage and feed areas are the primary sludge beds.)  The floor drain is normally closed and would need to be manually opened to drain.  A determination would then be made as to the effect of the spill, and cleanup or salvage operations would be undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe chloramination process is a simple gravity system.  Ammonia dosage is manually adjusted and fed by gravity into the plant effluent lines in a vault beneath the tank.  The ammonia tank is surrounded by a concrete containment berm desi"
