The employees at the Sanborn Terminal & Storage are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\r\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\r\n* Emergency Response Programs\r\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Sanborn Terminal that are regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule.  \r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe Sanborn Terminal is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline and propane storage/loading facility.  The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\r\n\r\nThe Sanborn Terminal has two pipelines that are routed through the facility and are regulated by the Department of Transportation.  These two pipelines are in part, a mix product line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane) and a dedicated propane line.  In addition, the facility receives propane from the pipeline to two 90,000 gallon capacity storage tanks and six 6"

The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\r\n\r\nAlternate Case Scenario \u00bf Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 30,500 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  This consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  This scenario would be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\r\n\r\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.
