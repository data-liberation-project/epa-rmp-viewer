Support operations include cold storage and administrative offices.\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Council Bluffs, Iowa facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n* 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\nThe key concepts in Tyson Foods's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.  Tyson Foods has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Tyson Foods management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia systems.  Tyson Foods employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\nTyson Foods policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.
