This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nSolvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC Augusta plant is located at 3702 Clanton Road in Augusta, GA.  The plant's parent company is Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC  located in Apharetta, Georgia.  Various chemicals are processed to produce engineering plastics.The only regulated substance at the plant in excess of the RMP threshold quantity is sulfur trioxide.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC Augusta plant. Since this plant is regulated under RMP and the OSHA PSM standard, this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC Augusta plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC Augusta plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Each process has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition).  The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e. automated shutdown systems).  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide inform"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC Augusta plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. Extensive predictive and preventive maintenance programs also ensure that equipment and instrumentation operates continuously, effectively, and accurately.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nThe Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC Augusta plant has a hot work permit program which details those areas which require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.  A permit is required in classified areas for all cutting, welding, spark producing equipment, etc. except in designated free burn areas.

These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nAlso, safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters.

New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.)  adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  Computer-based training (CBT) is also used to enhance plant training in safety and operating procedures and instructions.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC Augusta plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during normal operation and periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
