This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, mainenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible relases of regulated substances.                                                                                                                            2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled.  Our facility's primary activities encompass semi-conductor grade hydrochloric acid and zinc dialkyldithiophosphates.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are chlorine and hydrochloric acid at 37%.  Chlorine is used for making hydrochloric acid.  Hyrdrochloric acid is used for strictly to ship as a finished product to customers.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 540,000 pounds and hydrochloric acid maximum inventory is 1,000,000 pounds.                                                                                                         \n\n     3.  The worst case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To perform the required offsite consequences analyses for our facility, we have used EPA's RMP Comply.  The following provides details of the chosen scenarios.                                        \n\n     The worst case release scenario submitted for program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic relase of chlorine storage and handling system.  In this scenario, 180,000 pounds of chlorine is released over a ten minute time frame.  The toxic liquid release is estimated to "

An estimated 158,000 people may be affected by this elease.                                                                                 \n\n     The worst case scenario for hydrochloric acid involves a release of 165,000 pounds from the storage tank of hydrochloric acid.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 9,000 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as a dike that is 1200 square feet and 2.5 feet high is taken into account to calculate this scenario.  This dike has the effect of controlling the spread of the liquid. At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.70 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/l.  It is estimated that no residents will be affected by this type of release.                  \n\n     The alternate release scenario for chlorine involves a relase from chlorine storage and handling system.  The scenario involves the release of 9,450 pounds of chlorine.  The chlorine is assumed to evaporate during one minute from a burst pipe during transfer.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown systems.  At class D atomospheric stablilty and wind speed of 6.7 mph, the maximum distance of 3.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.
