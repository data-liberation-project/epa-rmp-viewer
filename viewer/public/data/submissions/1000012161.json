Ralcorp Frozen mixes, cooks and freezes pancakes, french toast and waffles. This plant was originally constructed in 1984 and, as is true with most industrial plants, has undergone modifications and additions over the years.\n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program rule as it has an ammonia refrigeration system that contains more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia. Bakery Chef has complied with both the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and the EPA Risk Management Program rule. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed loop system for product cooling.  In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Ralcorp Frozen has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. \n\n3.Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Kent facility.\n\n4.General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThis Ralcorp facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the system.  In case of a release that could travel off the plant property,"

      "SummaryText": " calls would be made to the Fire Department and the County Disaster Services Coordinator to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n5.Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of ammonia.\n\n6.Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance. Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRalcorp Frozen Bakery Products expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of a PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the revalidated process hazard analysis are designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.  Ralcorp expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release.
