The valves have been installed and operational since July 27,1999. Modeling of the alternative release scenario assumed these valves were in place and their installation has no impact on any other portion of this RMP."

      "SummaryText": "Facility personnel as well as upper management have a strong commitment to safety at all of the Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility (AWWU) facilities. Specifically, at the John M. Asplund Wastewater Treatment Facility, monthly safety meetings are held to discuss predetermined issues such as ladder safety, forklift safety, and chlorine safety. In addition, weekly operations meetings are held and safety issues are discussed as they come up. New personnel are trained prior to starting work at the facility. Dangerous or hazardous equipment and/or chemicals are well labeled, MSDS sheets on all compounds used at the facility are readily available, and new personnel are always accompanied by experienced personnel when handling compounds such as chlorine.\n\nThe John M. Asplund Wastewater Treatment Facility is subject to RMP since it stores gaseous chlorine in quantities greater than the threshold for the program. The facility treats municipal wastewater. Gaseous chlorine is injected into the treated wastewater for disinfection as the last process prior to release into Cook Inlet. Eight to twenty four 1-ton containers of chlorine are stored at the facility at anyone time.\n\nThe facility is also in compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) program and the SARA Title III program. Several ongoing steps are taken to prevent accidental releases. They include continuous evaluation and updating of the system such installing additional shut-off valves, making maintenance procedural improvements as they are recognized, and implementing on-site training on a regular basis.\n\nThe facility has had no incidents in the last five years. \nNo other impacts occurred.\n\nThe emergency response program for the facility primarily involves response by the Anchorage Fire Department (AFD). The AFD has well trained and equipped Hazmat teams who will respond in the even of an uncontrolled leak. AFD and AWWU personnel have participated together in emergency response drills.
