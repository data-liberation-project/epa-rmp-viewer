ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  We at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and protection.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at this facility.  It is our goal and objective to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release were to occur, Brenntag has coordinated emergency response activities with the Marion County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Indianapolis Fire Department.\n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE & THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  Brenntag's primary activities encompass chemical repackaging, warehousing and distribution.  Currently, there are six regulated substances present at this facility that exceed the Threshold Quantity (TQ) as defined within 40 CFR 68.130. \n\n\n\n3.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  Our facility has taken necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements as set forth under 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are currently in place at this facility.\n\n\n\na).  Process Safety Information:  Brenntag maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all regulated processes.\n\n\n\nb).  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA's):  This facility conducts comprehensive PHA's to ensure that hazards associated with each regulated process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The Fault Tree Analysis and What If Techniques are methodologies utilized for completion PHA's.  The PHA's are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  PHA's are re"

At a minimum, PHA's are revalidation every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.   \n\n\n\nc).  Operating Procedures:  For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround.  Operating procedures are regularly evaluated and are accessible to all applicable employees involved within each regulated process.\n\n\n\nd).  Training:  Brenntag has a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees are competent in the operating and safety procedures associated with the each regulated process. New employees receive basic training in process operations and safety procedures, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided whenever there has been a change in the process or at a minimum once every 3 years.\n\n\n\ne).  Mechanical Integrity:  Brenntag conducts inspections and maintenance on process equipment to ensure on-going equipment integrity.  Qualified personnel receive specialized training to ensure that process equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  Any equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nf).  Management of Change:  Written procedures are in place at Brenntag to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Applicable Brenntag personnel whose job task is affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly informed and trained of such changes to ensure safe and efficient i"
