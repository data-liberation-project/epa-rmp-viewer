The facility utilizes a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of ice cream and frozen desserts within the facility.  The refigerant used is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  The refrigerant is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nAs a part of its PMS Program, Dean Foods Co. of California, Inc. has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  These programs included:\n\n     Process Safety Information\n     Process Hazard Analysis\n     Operation Procedures\n     Training\n     Mechanical Integrity\n     Management of Changd\n     Pre-Startup Review\n     Compliance Audits\n     Incident Investigations\n     Employee Participation\n     Hot Work Permits\n     Contractor Safety\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION:\n\nAs a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the realibility of actions taken during an incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the refrigeration system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911, which will notify the California Region 1 LEPC.  In addition, the LEPC has included Dean Foods Co. Of California, Inc. in its local emergency response planning.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDSENT HIST"

Because of inherent safety controls within the refrigeration system, a chemical release under this scenario was considered an alternate release, although not as likely to occur as others considered.  This system was last reviewed September, 2003.\n\n     FIRE / EXPLOSION\n\nThe possibility of an explosion and/or fire related to the facility refrigeration system was considered, although the occurrence very remote.  In such an event, the refrigeration source would be removed by shutting down the feed valves and appropriate safety measures would be taken by operation personnel.  If a fire is of an electrical nature, power to the affected area would be cut via circuit breakers.  This system was last reviewed June, 2002.\n\n     WEATHER\n\nVarious weather conditions, and their possible effect on the facilities refrigeration system were also studied, and considered to be remote."

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nSTEPS TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Installation of  sensors, revised operating procedures and increased employee training are some of the major staps taken to improve safety at our facility.  In addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the refrigeration system in accordance with industry association  and will continue to implement its PMS/RMP Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program.\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSES:\n\nUnder CalARP program requirements, applicable external events shall be considered within the hazard review.  Hazard reviews are encompassed within a complete Process Safety Management program, which is reviewed and updated every five years.  Such events included, but were not limited to; seismic activity & sabotage with the effect on safety of the facility and the surroundings being considered.\n\n     SABOTAGE\n\nThe Dean foods Company facility is located on a site controlled by security officers, operating 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  These officers provide active, secured restricted access with manual inspections and verification of all vehicles entering and leaving the property.  Additionally, a secondary level of restricted access exists within the production facility.  A key code entry is required to gain access to the production facility and refrigeration room.  For these reasons, the likelihood of a chemical accident was considered remote.\n\n     SEISMIC ACTIVITY\n\nThe potential for earthquakes, and the possible effect on the facility taking into account the existing seismic restraints incorporated into the facility/equipment design was also considered.
