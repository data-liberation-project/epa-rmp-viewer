These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup.  Emergency shutdown procedures include the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that an emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner.  Operating procedures are regularly reviewed, certified annually, and are readily accessible to those involved in operating and maintaining the process.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Ammonia plant has a comprehensive training program in place to conduct initial and refresher training for all personnel who operate and maintain a covered process.  Operations personnel are initially trained in assigned unit process overviews and operating procedures.  The training includes specific safety and health hazards, normal and emergency operations and safe work practices.  Operators receive classroom, field training, exercise and simulation training.  Operators are required to demonstrate their knowledge through tests, skill demonstrations and have adequate knowledge to perform job duties and tasks in a safe manner.  Refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Ammonia plant carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Woodside Energy - Beaumont New Ammonia plant in Nederland, Texas, are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Woodside Energy - Beaumont New Ammonia plant in Nederland is a hydrogen-based greenfield ammonia facility, which is expected to begin producing ammonia in 2025. The project is a collaboration between Woodside Energy and Linde that integrates Linde\u0092s low-carbon intensity hydrogen production and carbon capture technology with Woodside Energy\u0092s ammonia production, storage and transportation infrastructure. Anhydrous Ammonia and the Synthesis Gas Flammable Mixture are the only two Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substances present in the covered process above the threshold quantity (TQ) identified in the Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA\u0092s) RMP rule (40 CFR 68). Synthesis Gas is used in the loop section of the plant and is a combination of hydrogen, ammonia, and nitrogen with a CAT 4 flammability rating. Individually Hydrogen and natural gas (containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane) are also used in the ammonia product process but are not present in quantities that exceed the TQ.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Ammonia plant has developed an accidental release prevention program to comply with the requirements set out under the RMP rule. In addition, this program complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA\u0092s) P"

All changes are systematically evaluated, documented, approved and implemented while minimizing risks and maintaining operational efficiency.  Employees involved in operating a process and maintenance whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.  If a change results in a change in the process safety information and/or an operating procedure, such information is updated.  \n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety review is required for new facility or modified plants prior to commissioning and prior to start up after a major maintenance turnaround or shutdown.  A PSSR is conducted to confirm that the required construction, modification or maintenance actions have been completed in accordance with design specifications and that all safety, operating, maintenance, reliability and emergency procedures are adequate and in place.  The PSSR must further confirm that recommendations from the various PHAs have been implemented, process safety information has been updated, and training completed.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Ammonia plant conducts compliance audits at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed under the RMP rule are adequate and are being followed.

Management shall promptly determine and document an appropriate response to each of the findings of the compliance audit, and document that deficiencies have been corrected. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Ammonia plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  Incident investigations are initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  An incident investigation team is established and consists of at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A tracking system is in place to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations.  Resolutions and corrective actions are documented.  The report is reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Ammonia plant believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Examples of employee participation include involvement in safety committees, pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analysis, job hazard analysis and procedure reviews.  Employees can also participate in the resolution of process hazard analysis, compliance audit and incident investigation recommendations and findings.  A system is in place for employees to anonymously report RMP-reportable accidents or other related RMP non-compliance issues.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Ammonia plant uses contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities."

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Ammonia plant strives to continually improve its safety program and to reward employees for outstanding safety performance.  The site has a Safety Committee that meets on a regular basis.  The Safety Committee is comprised of employees from all areas of the plant.  Lessons learned are held to present different safety topics to raise awareness. The site has continuous training in the Training Registration module within the company-wide HSE MESH system.  The assigned courses are sent out on a set frequency to the employees based on their job description.  Site wide safety drills are conducted to determine deficiencies and improvement opportunities.  Tabletop exercises are held internally and with neighboring and local LEPC.  The site has a system in place to notify the community should there be an off-site release."
