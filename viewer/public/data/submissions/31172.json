The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Fairfax are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Fairfax Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and sale of pesticides, feed, seed, and farm supplies.\nAnhydrous ammonia nurse tanks are filled at the MFA Bulk Plant and stored at this facility until used by farmers.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 4,400 pounds in each 1000 gallon nurse tank.  There could be as many as 26 filled nurse tanks at one time. This facility does not transfer anhydrous ammonia.  Nurse tanks are filled at the bulk anhydrous plant at Hwy 59N and Hwy J, then parked at this facility until the farmer picks them up.\n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will adopt changes required to meet the 1999 ANSI Code as budgets and time allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n    6/3/04"
