BERNARD PARISH WATER TREATMENT PLANT \n\n                        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n     In 1990, the United States Congress amended the Clean Air Act to address Chemical\nAccident Prevention by requiring the USEPA to develop chemical accident prevention/community\nright-to-know regulations referred to as the Risk Management Program Rule.\n     The Rule requires covered facilities, whether they be Public, Commercial, or Industrial\nentities, to create and implement a risk management/accident prevention program and to submit a\nstructured Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the USEPA by not later than June 21, 1999.  A covered\nfacility is one that stores any of a long list of dangerous chemicals (e.g., chemicals that are either\ntoxic, flammable, or explosive), in quantities greater than the threshold levels listed in the Rule. \nListed toxic chemicals and their respective threshold quantities can be found in the Federal\nRegulations at 40 CFR 68.\n     The stationary (potential) source that is addressed herein is the St. Bernard Parish Water  \nTreatment Plant.  The Plant's location is identified as follows:\n\n                                   1) Street Address:       1111 E. St. Bernard Highway \n                         Chalmette, LA 70043\n\n                                        2) Geographical Location:     29o55'52\" North Latitude\n                         89o57'23\" West Longitude\n\n\n     Chlorine gas, an air toxic chemical, is listed.  Chlorine is used by most water treatment and\nwastewater treatment plants as a disinfectant.  The threshold quantity listed for chlorine is 2,500\npounds.  The St. Bernard Parish Water Treatment Plant stores chlorine gas in quantities that exceed\nthe  threshold quantity and, as a result, is a covered facility.  Accordingly, St. Bernard Parish has\nconducted a Program 2 Hazard Review, a Compliance A"

The Parish also is preparing written Safety, O&M, and Emergency\nResponse Plans for the safe handling of the toxic gas, as required by the USEPA.  \n     It is pertinent to note, however, that the St. Bernard Parish Water Treatment Plant has been\nin continuous operation for more than 45 years.  During that long operational history, there has never\nbeen a release of chlorine gas of such a magnitude so as to cause injury to people, pets or property\nsurrounding the water treatment plant.  \n     Pure chlorine gas (an air toxic), used to disinfect the Parish's drinking water supply, is\nreceived and stored at the above location in the form of a gas that is liquified under pressure.  The\nliquified chlorine gas is supplied in steel pressure cylinders that contain one ton (2000 lbs) of\nchlorine when received.  Typical inventory of chlorine at the St. Bernard Parish Water Treatment\nPlant is five ton cylinders.  \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\"Worst-Case\" Scenario \n     The USEPA regulations require an assessment of risk and emergency response planning for\naccidental release of any of the listed air toxics under two (or more) different scenarios.  That is, the\nregulations call for analysis/planning for a \"worst-case\" scenario based on rigid scenario conditions\nfor any air toxic.  These \"worst-case\" scenario - required conditions are identified as follows:\n\n                                                       Release Duration                   10 minutes\n                                                            Quantity of Air Toxic Released          2000 lbs\n                                                       Release Rate                       200 lbs/min\n                                                                 Endpoint Toxic Concentration (safe level)    0.0087 mg/l\n                                                  Windspeed                     1.5 M/sec (3.36 mph)\n                                "

The resulting risk area for this \"worst-case\" scenario was determined from the\nUSEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants for the St.\nBernard Parish Water Treatment Plant.  For an urban setting, such as is the condition at the St.\nBernard Parish Water Treatment Plant, the distance to the endpoint (or safe exposure distance) is\nlisted in Exhibit 4-12 in the Guidance document as a 1.3 miles radius around the water treatment\nplant.\n     Additionally, the USEPA regulations provide for consideration of passive mitigation in\n\"worst-case\" assessments, i.e., enclosure of air toxic containers/feed systems within a building is\nconsidered a valid, passive mitigation condition.  Passive mitigation presence provides for a toxic\ngas release area reduction of 45 percent (i.e., by multiplying the model \"worst-case\" radius by a\nfactor of 0.55).  However, the St. Bernard Parish Water Treatment Plant has no passive mitigation\npresent.  Thus, the USEPA's model endpoint for chlorine remains 1.3 miles for the St. Bernard\nParish Water Treatment Plant in the \"worst-case\" scenario.\n\nAlternative Scenario\n     The regulations also permit planners to provide one or more realistic, alternative scenarios\ninvolving accidental release of air toxics.

      "SummaryText": ". Bernard\nParish Water Treatment Plant was based on a tubing failure, a bad connection or valve failure\nresulting in the release of chlorine gas through a 5/16 inch-diameter whole or opening in a ton\ncylinder. \n     This scenario was modeled by the USEPA study, (see Exhibit 4-15 in the Guidance\ndocument) and produced the following information.  The release described above would last for 60\nminutes with an average maximum gas flow rate of 15 lbs/min.  Again, for an urban setting, the\nrelease impact area, i.e., the distance from the source out to the endpoint concentration for chlorine\n(0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm) was found to be 0.1 miles.\n     Further, while only passive mitigation can be considered for the \"worst-case\" scenario, the\nregulations permit inclusion of active mitigation factor(s) for the alternative scenario modeling that\ncan further reduce the estimated toxic gas spread area (i.e., distance to endpoint).  A few examples\nof active mitigation are air scrubbers, emergency shut-down systems, and sprinkler systems. \nHowever, the St. Bernard Parish Water Treatment Plant employs no form of active mitigation.  Thus,\nthe USEPA's model endpoint for chlorine remains 0.1 miles for the St. Bernard Parish Water\nTreatment Plant in the \"alternative\" scenario.\n     The Parish has developed a toxic gas release Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that is\napplicable to both the Parish's Water and Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The plan has been\ncoordinated with the Parish's Fire and Police Departments.\n     During the operational history of the plant and certainly for the past 5 years, there have been\nno toxic gas releases from the plant.\n\n  \n\n\n"
