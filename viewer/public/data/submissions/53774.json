Facility Policy\n\n      The owner, management and employees of Sur-Gro Plant Food Co. Inc.-Forest City are committed to the\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility \nis prepared to work with the local fire department, Holt County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and\nminimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n2.   Facility Information.\n\n      The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers. The fertilizer product, anhydrous\nammonia is received, stored and distributed for the dircet application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous\nammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\n\n       An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental\nreleases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n       The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and ANSI K61.1-1999 covering\nanhydrous ammonia. The OSHA and ANSI standards are referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section\n8.3 (b).\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n       This is a new facility therefore there has not been any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia to cause \nany deaths, injuries or significant property damage at this facility or off-site.\n\n\n6.    Emergency Action Plan\n\n       The facility has:\n\n       a. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n       b. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and Community right-to-know\ninformatio"
