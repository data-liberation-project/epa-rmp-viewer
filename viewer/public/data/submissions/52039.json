It strives to maintain a safe workplace.  Our farmer owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan for prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  One of the activities of this company is the retail sale of anhydrous ammonia to area farmers as fertilizer for crop production.\n\nOur plant consists of two ? 11,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tanks.  The maximum quantity stored (filled at 85%) is 96,000 lbs.  In addition, there could be 23 additional anhydrous trailers, 22 holding 1000 gallons and 1 holding 2000 galons that could be stored here.  This would add an additional 104,000 pounds of product ( filled at 85%).  This makes a total storage capacity of 200,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia stored at the Bartlett Anhydrous Plant.\n\nOur plant is operated and maintained in strict accordance with all state and federal rules and regulations.  The employees who work in the facility are training at a state school every three years and company wide on a yearly basis on the proper procedures to operate the plant, as well as the procedures to full a nurse tank.  Our workers always have fresh safety water on hand and wear the proper personal protective equipment (goggles and gloves) during ammonia operations.\n\nBartlett Cooperative Association in Bartlett is proud to report that there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years resulting in injury, property damage, death, evacuation, sheltering in place, or other emergency procedures.\n\nOur emergency response plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public, and area emergency responders.   Our company?s emergency response plan is shared with the local fire department and the county LEPC.  First responders will be given a tour of our facility and in return, they?ve agreed to assist us in the event "
