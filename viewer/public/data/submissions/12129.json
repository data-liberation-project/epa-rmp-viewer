      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Joseph Jensen Filtration Plant (Jensen Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nThe Jensen Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and eme"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nIn addition, all MWDSC chlorine systems have undergone a high priority evaluation for Y2K readiness.  They will be Y2K compliant by July 31, 1999, though no Y2K problems are anticipated.\n\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy for chlorine involves the preparation of integrated contingency plans, which address emergency response for hazardous materials and are tailored to each facility.  These plans integrate with the emergency response services available in the community and are in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  Jensen Plant has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  This emergency response plan is being  coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  Jensen Plant has an excellent safety record with chlorine use.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe MWDSC Joseph Jensen Filtration Plant is located at 13100 Balboa "

The plant was built in 1972 to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. Chlorine is received at the Jensen Plant in a covered unloading area just north of the Administration Building.  The chlorine evaporators and chlorinators are located in the Chlorine Building.  The Chlorine Building is located north of the Administration Building, beside the unloading area.  The chlorine storage and use at the Jensen Plant is subject to EPA and CalARP rules, as well as the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nThe chlorine unloading area is continuously monitored in the control room by a video camera and chlorine leak detectors.  Chlorine leak sensors are also provided in the chlorine building and chlorine vent boxes, located outside the building.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process, is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system from any of the three control panels: unloading platform, north wall of the main building, or the east wall of the Area Control Center.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided in the chlorine unloading area and outside the chlorine room.\n\nThe chlorine pressure reducing valves, leak detectors, and computer control system are connected to uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system.

The filtration plant has an emergency generator system, which provides backup power to run the filtration plant in the event of a power failure.  \n\nThe control room at the plant is manned 24 hours a day, year round.  Access to the plant is through guarded security gates, which are closed after regular hours.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nFor the worst-case as well as alternative release scenarios, the released liquid chlorine is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) which then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distances to the toxic endpoints were estimated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.06).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (77 deg F), and average relative humidity (50%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  No passive mitigation or administrative controls were considered for the worst-case release scenario.  The results of the dispersion a"

Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no such chlorine releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the Jensen Plant boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis, where a release would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement. \n\nThe alternative release scenario selected involves the release of chlorine from the monel flexible hose connecting the chlorine storage vessel to the chlorination process.  This scenario can occur if the operator uses a flex hose which is worn or has a defect, resulting in a crack during withdrawal of chlorine from the chlorine storage vessel. It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16-inch) diameter.  If such a leak were to occur, the control room would be immediately warned by the chlorine monitors installed at the facility.  It is assumed that approximately fifteen minutes would be required for an emergency response team to be notified, don personal protective equipment, and evaluate the s"

Then the emergency response team or the operator would activate the remote controlled shutoff actuator and immediately close the valve at the chlorine storage vessel (chlorine flow from storage is stopped in approximately 3 seconds after the activation of remote controlled shutoff actuator).  The activation of the shutoff actuator is considered as an active mitigation.  This will reduce the total quantity of chlorine released to the atmosphere during an accident.\n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of this scenario is highly unlikely because the flex hose is carefully inspected during each connection/disconnection operation, and during operator rounds, once each shift.  In addition, under the Jensen Plant preventive maintenance schedule, the flex hoses are replaced at least every two years (more frequently than recommended by the manufacturer).  \n\nThe alternative release scenario toxic endpoint distance was also estimated using the RMP*Comp (version 1.06) software.  Toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3 ppm.  EPA suggested typical meteorological conditions used were Stability Class D, wind speed of 3.0 meter per second, average air temperature of 77 deg F, and average relative humidity of 50 percent.  The results of the dispersion analysis indicated that the alternative release scenario goes offsite, but has no discernable offsite impacts.\n\nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Jensen Plant during the last five years.  \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nJensen Plant complies with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements.
