The facility is also committed to providing its employees with the skills necessary to safely handle the chemicals used at the site. \n\nFor the anhydrous ammonia,  the tanks and associated piping are visually inspected and maintained to ensure the tank and its components are in good condition and they do not develop defects which could compromise the tanks integrity.  Both tanks contain manual shut-off valves which will stop the flow out of the piping if a rupture in any of the connected hosing should develop.  The anhydrous tanks are also equipped with automatic valves which will shut off the flow if a pipe break were to occur.  The anhydrous ammonia tanks are equipped with break away piping  which will prevent damage to the tank and loss of substantial product if a transfer tank is not disconnected prior to moving away from the loading area.   The applicator tanks for the anhydrous operations are also inspected regularly and maintained to prevent releases.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nRothsay Farmers Coop stores and handles anhydrous ammonia in qauntities above the 10,000 pound threshold, which requires the facility to complete a Risk Management Plan (RMP)  \n\nThe facility stores and distributes anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in two 30,000 gallon tanks at  the facility.  Facility personnel are responsible for transferring the anhydrous ammonia to transfer tanks which are used in conjunction with injection equipment to inject the product into the ground for use as a fertilizer.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst case scenario for the anhydrous ammonia stored and handled on the site would be a tank rupture releasing 280,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which would crea"

The EPAs RMP comp program was used to determine the worst case scenario impacts.\n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen for the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling was a pipe leak for two minutes from the tank resulting in a smaller release of anhydrous ammonia and vaporization.  The alternative release scenario would have an impact extending to approximately 0.83 miles from the pipe leak.  An EPA reference table was used to determine this alternative release scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA (29CFR 1910.111) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release our first steps will include, calling 911 which will in turn notify the local fire department.  The processes utilized to prevent injuries from the release will be to evacuate residences downwind of the release which could be impacted by the anhydrous ammonia vapors.  The fire department will utilize water to minimize the amount of vaporization.  Water is also the first means of first aid for persons that come into contact with the anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe site has not had a release of anhydrous ammonia within the last five years which resulted in any injury to site personnel or to surrounding residents.\n\nEmergency Response Program: \n\nAll of the sites emergency procedures are conducted with the local volunteer fire department.  In case of an accident at the site, the local fire department would be called upon for assistance.  The facility personnel are trained in the proper handling of the anhydrous ammonia equipment and in basic first aid procedures in case of contact with the anhydrous ammonia.  Water tanks for utilizing in case of accidental contact with anhydrous ammonia are present on all of the transfer tanks.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve S"
