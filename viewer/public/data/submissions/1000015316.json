Fresh produce is brought from the fields, cooled to remove field heat, and then stored in a cold storage warehouse. The system is operated in full configuration during the growing season from April to November.\n\nInspection procedures are in place at Salyer American that incorporate refrigeration equipment review prior to startup and during operations.  These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases.  The equipment is reviewed by onsite personnel, and certified refrigeration contractors as required. Licensed refrigeration engineers are utilized to review new and modified systems prior to startup.\n\nInitial emergency response is provided by onsite personnel.  Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release.\n\nLocal fire and police departments with mutual aide response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractor would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency contact information is included in this RMP.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is tied together to form a single common system.  This equipment consists of portable and permanently installed equipment.\n\nSalyer American Cooling maintains an accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes equipment monitoring, regular inspections and maintenance, and log keeping "

Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. \n\nA thorough review of the system, including a What If hazard analysis, was performed in accordance with update requirements.\nThe facility has implemented the federal and state mandated emergency response plan (Business Response Plan). This plan outlines procedures for emergency ammonia release response as well as general facility response.\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The safety coordinator is responsible for contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if offsite evacuations are required.\n\nAs required, refrigeration equipment will be inspected and reviewed periodically and as new equipment becomes operational onsite. This RMP, which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system, is maintained onsite."
