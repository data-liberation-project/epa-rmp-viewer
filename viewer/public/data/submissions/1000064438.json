      "SummaryText": "The City of Belmont WWTP's employees who work with chlorine and sulfur dioxide are trained in the safe handling of these chemicals, equipment that uses them in the process, and chemical storage. This training includes the awareness of dangers of the hazardous chemicals and response procedures in the event of an incident involving them. Although some of this training does include emergency response for those employees on the response team, much of the training is awareness for employees who operate the process equipment. Operating procedures and guidelines have been established for emergency response decisions. This includes the proper shutdown procedures, evacuation procedures, and the proper procedures for handling small and immediate incidences. There is an emergency response team on site that responds to small emergency incidents. In all events of emergency response, the local fire department will be notified to respond. Under the direction of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), the local fire department has a response plan in coordination with the City of Belmont WWTP's emergency response plan. The information necessary for coordination is included with the Process Safety Management (PSM) program. For specific information please refer to the facility's Emergency Response Plan which is incorporated by reference and available through the Operator in Responsible Control (ORC)."
