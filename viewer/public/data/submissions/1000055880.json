This equipment has been classified as PSM covered. This equipment is inspected on a frequency determined internally, based on past performance and risk. Any problems found during the inspections are repaired in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nThere are operating procedures for each unit. These procedures are reviewed and certified on an annual basis. GB Biosciences has developed computer based training (CBT) for each procedure. Individuals affected by a procedure must perform a CBT for that procedure and pass a subsequent written test once per year. Training records are kept of this activity.\r\n\r\nAll incidents are investigated to determine root cause and measures to prevent recurrence.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program Level 2\r\nThe facility has no program level 2 processes.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\nOver the past 5 years, the facility has experienced 1 accidental release that met the RMP\r\nreporting criteria threshold. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nThe Greens Bayou site has a 24 hour emergency response system in place. The site operates under an Incident Command System (ICS) for all emergencies. GB Biosciences has personnel on site trained to respond to fires, hazardous material releases, medical needs, and rescue situations 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Quarterly training and regular drills are received by all emergency responders. GB Biosciences is a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid organization (CIMA).

Both of these groups include the local fire department, sheriff's department, Harris County Office of Emergency Management ambulance services, local hospital, neighboring industries and business owners.\r\n\r\nGB Biosciences utilizes a computer driven voice message alarm system to communicate to the plant population the type and location of an emergency. Critical plant personnel are also equipped with portable radios to aid in communications during an emergency. Radios are also in place for instant communications with neighboring industries and other CIMA members. \r\n\r\nGB Biosciences has its own internal fire water system with backup water supply.

GBB will meet or exceed Federal, State, and Local regulations and other legal requirements.\r\n\r\nFacility Information\r\nThe GB Biosciences facility produces agricultural chemicals. The plant has three covered processes Isophthalonitrile (IPN), Chlorothalonil (CTL), and chlorine distribution. The CTL unit produces the fungicide active ingredient Chlorothalonil which goes into the trade name products Ultrex&reg; and Bravo&reg;. Chlorothalonil is a fungicide for bananas, potatoes, peanuts, turf and other crops.\r\n\r\nThe IPN is produced by reacting ammonia and meta-xylene in the presence of oxygen and a catalyst. Ammonia enters the plant by rail car or tank truck, and is stored in a 12,000 gallon storage tank. Meta-xylene enters the plant either by railcar or truck.\r\n\r\nThe CTL unit takes IPN reacts it in vapor phase with Chlorine in the presence of a catalyst to form Chlorothalonil. Technical CTL is sent to Syngenta formulation plants worldwide or formulated and packaged into finished product on-site.\r\n\r\nThe plant has a chlorine distribution process which provides liquid chlorine to the CTL unit. Chlorine liquid is received in 180,000 pound rail cars and transferred to the CTL unit via pipeline. The chlorine is vaporized in the CTL unit and fed into the process.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program Level 3\r\nIn addition to complying with EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68), GB Biosciences is governed by OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (1910.119). There are two (2) regulated chemicals above the threshold quantity; ammonia and chlorine. GB Biosciences has identified three covered processes; IPN process, CTL process, and chlorine distribution. \r\n\r\nProcess hazard analyses (PHA) were performed for each covered unit.
