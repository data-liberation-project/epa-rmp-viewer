      "SummaryText": "The City of Coleman, Texas, operates the Coleman Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The WTP is rated at 6 million gallons per day and provides potable water to residents within the City and nearby areas.  The WTP receives its water from Hords Creek Lake and from Lake Coleman.  While the water from Hords Creek Lake flows by gravity, the water from Lake Coleman is pumped to the WTP.  In order to prevent a biological growth layer from forming in the pipeline and to remove algae that the WTP could not previously remove, chlorine is added to the water at the Lake Coleman Raw Water Pump Station.  The pump station is an unmanned facility that is operated by employees of the WTP.  Two one-ton containers of chlorine are planned for use at the pump station.  Chlorine will be fed from one container at a time, with the other container serving as a reserve supply.  Because the quantity of chlorine to be stored onsite will exceed the threshold allowed in the regulations and because a potential to impact offsite residents in case of a chlorine release exists, the City developed a Risk Management Program for this facility.  The City approached the engineering firm of Hibbs & Todd, Inc. for assistance in developing a Risk Management Program (Program) and in creating a Risk Management Plan to document these efforts.  \n\nColeman is committed to minimizing and preventing accidental releases of chlorine from the Lake Coleman Raw Water Pump Station.  The preparation of a Program will assist in these efforts.  A Management System has been established to ensure that the Program is implemented correctly and kept up-to-date.  The WTP Supervisor will have the overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Program.  \n\nAs part of the requirements for the Risk Management Program, a Hazard Assessment was conducted that evaluated a worst-case chlorine release scenario and an alternate release scenario.  The worst-case release scenario involved the release of the entire contents of a 2,000-pound"

      "SummaryText": " container over a 10-minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was 3.0 miles, as determined by the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  No passive mitigation measures were used.  The potential number of offsite residents affected by this scenario is 70.  The alternate release scenario was determined to be a faulty connection to a one-ton chlorine container.  The Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, published by the American Water Works Association, was used to determine a distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.56 miles.  For this scenario, 2 people could be potentially affected.  \n\nA Prevention Program was also established, and expands upon the current practices already in-place at the Lake Coleman Raw Water Pump Station.  Written operating procedures have been developed and are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties at the pump station before being allowed to work alone.  Operators conduct weekly inspections and any problems with the chlorine system are documented and addressed.  In addition, the operators insure that the various equipment used in the chlorine process are maintained according to the manufacturers? recommendations.  Because of these efforts, the pump station has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either onsite or offsite, within the previous five (5) years.  As part of the Program, the operators will periodically perform compliance audits and incident investigations, when necessary.  \n\nThe Lake Coleman Raw Water Pump Station complies with the emergency response regulations per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 and also with applicable fire code and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  Because of the lack of sufficient resources, the WTP has developed an emergency action plan and has coordinated with the Coleman Fire Department and the Lake Coleman Warden to provide emergen"

Conversely, if the Warden notices a release, he will notify the WTP and the Fire Department.  The Fire Department will oversee response procedures, including the evacuation of surrounding residents.  In order to increase the effectiveness of the emergency action plan, it is recommended that the chlorine leak detection equipment be installed at the pump station.  This equipment can alert both the operations staff at the WTP, the Fire Department, and the Warden should a sustained chlorine leak occur, thereby decreasing response time."
