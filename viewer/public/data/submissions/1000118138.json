The company has implemented comprehensive employee safety programs and a Process Safety Management (PSM) system to support the safe operation of its LPG gas system.\n\nDAP Products, Inc. manufactures aerosol products, and its LPG operations include two large propellant tanks, along with pumps, piping, valves, and fittings leading to the aerosol can filling heads. The largest tank holds approximately 63,800 lbs of an LPG blend (15.75% propane, 34.25% isobutane, 50.00% dimethyl ether). This flammable mixture is regulated under both the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standards. No other substances at the facility are present in quantities that would trigger additional RMP or PSM requirements.\n\nThe facility has implemented a robust PSM program and Hazard Communication program, both required by OSHA to ensure worker safety. The RMP is in place to protect the surrounding community.\n\nTo ensure the safe operation of the LPG system, the facility uses a variety of safety devices and procedures, including relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, alarms, grounding mechanisms, and excess flow devices.\n\nDAP Products, Inc. has an exemplary safety record, with no accidental releases from the LPG system. An Emergency Action Plan is also in place, which includes coordination with the local fire department, regular employee training, emergency drills, and public notification procedures.\n\nThe company is committed to continuously evaluating and improving the LPG system to ensure the safety of both employees and the surrounding community through regular program reviews, external audits, and operator training and drills."
