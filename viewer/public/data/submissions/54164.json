In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the \"environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.\"  They went on to say, \"We further believe ExxonMobil to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been intergrated into its ongoing business processes.\" \n\nThe ExxonMobil Chemical Company Baton Rouge Plastics Plant (BRPP) has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the neighboring community as well as employees and contractors on plant property.  ExxonMobil, operator of BRPP, has a long-standing dedication to safety and environmental stewardship as the corporation's primary goal. Safety and protection of the environment are an integral part of ExxonMobil's operations and corporate culture.  \n\nBRPP's dedication to safety is demonstrated in many ways.  To help ensure the safety of BRPP operations, BRPP invests significant resources in accident prevention. Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes, and other operations facilities.

If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with our Emergency Response Plan.  \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's new Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nBRPP, located in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, is owned and operated by ExxonMobil Chemical Company (ExxonMobil).  BRPP is a low density, high-pressure polyethylene (LDPE) manufacturing facility.  \n\nIn accordance with the EPA's new Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120, BRPP was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were on the plant site in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity defined by the regulations.  The largest quantity is evaluated because the regulations guide the operator to consider the largest quantity of the substance in a process or operation if a listed substance is used or located in different processes or operations on a plant site.  The term \"threshold quantity\" is simply the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated under these new regulations.  Based on process knowledge, ExxonMobil identified the regulated substances involved in the operation and determined the quantities of each regulated substance on the site.\n\nBRPP uses six regulated substances above the threshold quantity in 13 separate processes.  These substances are acetaldehyde, n-butane, 1-butene, ethylene, propylene, and vinyl acetate.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements"

BRPP has aligned and integrated its safety management programs at a high level with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program regulations for consistency and effectiveness. Because processes at BRPP that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAll employees at BRPP are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, BRPP has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBRPP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address written data and engineering drawings on the design of the facility, the chemistry of the process and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any of the process safety information.\n\nSafety data is maintained for all chemicals that are used, handled, or produced at the facility.  This data includes permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity and corrosive information, thermal and chemical stability, toxicity data (if applicable), personal protective equipment, and measures to be taken in the event of physical contact or airborne exposure to a chemical.  This information is maintained in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), as part of OSHA's Hazard Communication Program at the plant.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented the safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, etc.).  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems such as automatic shutdown systems.\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nBRPP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

      "SummaryText": " that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nBRPP primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these PHA evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings and suggestions are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative priority ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking process is intended to ensure that potential hazards that are considered to have the highest priority receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards are continuously evaluated and maintained in a safe condition, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the Process Hazard Analysis.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nBRPP maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial sta"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, BRPP maintains CAPS (Compentency Analysis Profile System) Documentation which contain sections, that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nBRPP employs a comprehensive training program for all employees at the plant.  New employees receive job-specific basic training in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through test, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is provided as often as necessary, and no less than every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nBRPP uses contractors to perform project-specific activities and to supplement the plant workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  For those contractors who work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ens"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, BRPP evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Safety personnel periodically monitor contractor safety performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nBRPP conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure, before startup of the modified process or unit, that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that all personnel and supporting systems are operationally ready to operate the newly-modified process or equipment.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nBRPP has well-established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment, including pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pump"

The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and  (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures are intended to ensure that maintenance work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that the proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nBRPP developed safe work practices designed to ensure worker and process safety and these safe work practices are followed regularly to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  Examples of safe work practices include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel in the process areas (2) a lockout"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.  A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training regarding the process modification.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nBRPP promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and underlying cause(s) of the incident to develop corrective actions and implement steps to prevent a recurrence of the incident and prevent similar inc"

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, BRPP periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented properly, to evaluate the effectiveness of the program, and to develop ideas for improving the program.  OSHA PSM Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained for future review.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC ACCIDENT PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at BRPP have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release in the unlikely event of an accidental release, and"

These response procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and for accounting for all personnel (employees, contractors, and visitors) after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training to enable them to fulfill their role in an emergency.  The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on modifications made to processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for BRPP is coordinated with the East Baton Rouge Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  BRPP has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a method for notifying the public in the event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, BRPP conducts periodic emergency response drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substance in the plant.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAs explained above, many of the elements of BRPP's Accident Prevention Program include initiatives, methods, o"
