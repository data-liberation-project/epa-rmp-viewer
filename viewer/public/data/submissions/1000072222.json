If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the City of Columbus Division of Fire and the Franklin County Department of Emergency Management, as appropriate, through the 911 Service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of City of Columbus Division of Fire. The primary hospital response is provided through Mount Carmel West Hospital (and Level I Trauma Center). The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Columbus South Terminal is a refined product storage and distribution terminal, including the butane blending system (direct injection into the gasoline truck rack lines). The Risk Management Plan covers the butane blending system including three horizontal storage vessels, the associated piping, one blending skid, two sample analyzers along with associated gasoline fast loops, and one truck offloading point.\r\n\r\nThe Facility's worst case scenario is the complete failure of one liquefied butane vessel filled to 100% capacity resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site and includes public receptors. The Facility's alternate (potential to impact off-site populations) scenario is a vapor cloud explosion of a 10 minute release resulting from an impact to 3 inch piping. The resulting distance to endpoint extends off-site and affects public receptors.\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Columbus South Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmen"

Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor- Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all 14 compliance elements) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).\r\n\r\nThis Facility has never had an accident or incident involving the butane blending system resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Columbus South Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the City of Columbus Division of Fire and request their assistance. The Facility's Emergency Response Action Plan is coordinated with the City of Columbus Division of Fire and the Franklin County Department of Emergency Management. The City of Columbus Division of Fire is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the event of a significant release. The Columbus South Terminal maintains a vegetation control plan to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the butane vessels.  The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan.\r\n\r\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety. Also, Buckeye is implementing a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all 3 year PSM/RMP training cycles."
