The recommendations for the LAROCS included the performance of a detailed seismic assessment. These recommendations have been evaluated, and implemented or adequately addressed by the LADWP. Based on the performance of the detailed seismic assessment for the LAROCS in 2021, multiple structural deficiencies were identified that would require retrofitting or replacement of this facility. The LADWP has initiated and begun planning on a capital improvement project to replace the LAROCS.\n\n      Based on the 2024 seismic assessment updates for the above five facilities, three sets of recommendations (for LAAFP, LAROCS and VNCD) have been made to further improve chlorine safety during future earthquakes. Note that no additional recommendation was made for the VNCS#1 or VNCS#2 chlorine facilities.\n\n      It is expected that all the above 2024 recommendations will be evaluated, and implemented or adequately addressed by the LADWP by September 2026.

Midland valve actuators are connected to both the liquid and gas valves on the bulk tank. The Midland valve actuators will close on the bulk tank when two of the chlorine detectors detect 10 ppm of chlorine in the chlorine storage room. Ton containers connected to the feed header are equipped with automatic shut off valve actuators that automatically close the ton container feed valve when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the chlorine storage room by two chlorine detectors. \n\n      Liquid chlorine is normally withdrawn from the bulk tank to a piping header that leads to either one of the three evaporators. The gas discharge piping from the evaporators supply pressurized chlorine gas to the chlorinators through pressure regulating valves. A gas header from the bulk tank serves as a backup supply that automatically takes over when the evaporator is shut off due to a low temperature condition. The bank of eight ton containers can also feed liquid or gaseous chlorine through the header system to the evaporators or chlorinators.\n\n      There are a number of chlorine injectors located in four injection vaults. The injectors provide vacuum that draws chlorine gas from the chlorinators into mixing water to form a concentrated solution. The solution is piped through diffusers into the various water pipelines.  \n\n      Control of the chlorination process is by proportional flow and residual chlorine feed pacing. Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor and record the treated water residuals.\n\n      A dry media type chlorine gas scrubber system (main scrubber) is installed outside the chlorine storage room. The scrubber is designed to essentially neutralize any chlorine release from the PSV installed on the chlorine bulk storage tank. The scrubber is activated automatically by chlorine detectors installed inside the chlorin"

The evaporators vaporize the liquid in a water bath to form a superheated gas which passes through a pressure reducing valve and an evaporator activated vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, and then to the chlorinators. Chlorine gas from the vacuum regulating valve is pulled by vacuum to the chlorinators. The chlorinators regulate the gas flow and discharge it to the injection lines at the appropriate rate. Chlorine gas from the chlorinators is pulled by vacuum to injectors located on the downstream piping at various chlorine application points. \n\n      Multiple chlorine detectors continuously monitor the tank car area, ton container storage area, chlorine pipe trench and in the chlorination room. They alarm locally as well as at the operator's console in the control room.\n\n      A dry media chlorine mini-scrubber unit (MS) has been installed in the LAAFP chlorination room. MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release in the event of the failure of a vacuum regulating valve or a diaphragm leak in a pressure regulating valve. It can neutralize up to 25 lbs. of chlorine. The mini-scrubber is activated automatically at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm.\n\n      In the event power is lost at the LAAFP facility, two backup generators will automatically start and take overpowering the entire facility. Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.\n\n      The LAAFP control room at the plant is staffed 24 hours a day, year-round.  Access to the plant is through security gates, which are kept locked or staffed by security officers all the time.\n\n      The Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station - The primary supply of liquid chlorine at the LAROCS is from a 25-ton capacity bulk tank.

This detector combination minimizes the possibility of shutting down a tank car on just one detector false alarm or faulty detector. The Midland valve actuators can also be manually triggered from the following three locations: (1) Tank Car Platform Chlorine Control Panel (2) Chlorinator Room Chlorine Control Panel, and (3) Control Room SCADA system. In addition to the Midland actuators, there are three Jamesbury actuators on the hard piping to the flex hoses. The Midland actuators are for the tank car (the source) and the Jamesbury actuators are for the process feed piping. The Jamesbury valves are connected to the hard piping which is connected to the flex hoses; this closure is for stopping the possible backflow of chlorine in case a crack is developed in the flex hose. The chlorine leak detector can serve as a monitoring/alarm and/or perform shutdown function. The chlorine detectors near or on the tank car serve as a monitoring/alarm as well as perform the shutdown function.\n\n      In addition, to the leak detectors and capability to shut down tank cars, each tank car is set up with a pair of motion sensors. The motion sensors are at the top chain of the interlock system for the tank car.\n\n      The ton containers connected to the feed header are also equipped with automatic shutoff valve actuators. These valve actuators are installed on the angle valves of the ton containers that automatically close the ton container feed valve when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the ton container storage area. The automatic shutoff valve actuator is an automatic-closing, fail-safe valve closer that supplements the manual operation of the ton container valve by providing for powered valve closure in case of an emergency.\n\n      Liquid chlorine travels under pressure to evaporator units, while gaseous chlorine can be withdrawn dir"

The primary injection point is downstream of the Los Angeles Reservoir Ultraviolet Disinfection Plant (LARUVDP). The backup injection is upstream of the LARUVDP. The treated water is then piped into the distribution network which serves much of the San Fernando Valley with potable water and feeds other reservoirs. It also chlorinates the outlet flow from the Van Norman Bypass Reservoir and another pipeline called the Rinaldi Trunk Line.

The 25-ton bulk tank is the largest vessel (container) online. The station is equipped with a dry media chlorine main scrubber of one-ton capacity.
