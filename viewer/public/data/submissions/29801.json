The plant primarily manufactures anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions that provide Farmland's half million producer-members with affordable high quality nutrients for the crops they grow to feed families around the world.  As a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex, this facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require for facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan requirements include submission of the risk management plan to include hazard assessments defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for the Coffeyville Nitrogen Plant.\n\nFacility Overview\nThe Coffeyville facility is a new nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex scheduled to start production in January 2000.  The complex will produce for market approximately 550,000 tons of UAN and 180,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia annually for use as agricultural fertilizers.  The design of the facility incorporates state-of-art safety and environmental controls for the protection of the employees and the surrounding community.  Coffeyville Nitrogen has assembled a staff of knowledgeable personnel to provide the necessary leadership and skills to operate the fertilizer complex in a safe and economical manner.\n\nThe facility consists of an air separation unit, a ga"

The air separation unit makes high purity oxygen and nitrogen for use in the gasification unit.  In addition, BOC will market these gases along with argon to off-site customers. \n\nThe gasification unit produces hydrogen gas using the Texaco Hydrogen Generation Process.  The gasifier produces raw hydrogen and carbon oxides by the partial oxidation of petroleum coke with oxygen in the presence of water.  The petroleum coke will be provided primarily by the neighboring refinery, the Cooperative Refinery LLC, and supplemented with coke from other locations.  The hydrogen is purified by shift conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, the removal of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, and pressure swing absorption of  trace contaminants.  To ensure  the reliable operation of the gasification unit, Coffeyville Nitrogen has employed Texaco Syngas, Inc. to startup and operate the unit for the first five years of service.  \n\nThe ammonia synthesis unit reacts the hydrogen from the gasification unit with nitrogen from the air separation unit to make anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is either sold for direct fertilizer applications or upgraded for UAN solutions.  Ammonia along with by-product carbon dioxide from the gasification unit is used to produce liquid urea in the UAN plant.  Ammonia and air in the same plant are used to produce weak nitric acid solution that is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate.  The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product. Ammonia and UAN solutions can be shipped to the farmers by both truck and railcars.  On-site storage tanks have been constructed to safely hold the ammonia and UAN products until the farmers are ready to apply the fertilizers.\n\n\nImpact on the community\nCoffeyville Nitrogen employs"

For this facility the regulated substances in the toxic class are ammonia and chlorine.  The regulated substance in the flammable class is synthesis gas, which includes hydrogen.  The rule requires an analysis of the worst case toxic as that scenario affecting the greatest distance and a worst case flammable accident as a vapor cloud explosion.  Alternate scenarios, which are more reasonably likely events, for each regulated toxic and flammables in general must also be presented.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release-Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nBecause of the seasonal nature of fertilizer use and application in agriculture, large quantities of the ammonia produced at this facility must be stored until needed by the ultimate consumer.  The RMP rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst case event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nFor this facility, the largest single quantity of anhydrous ammonia is held in the atmospheric storage tank.  The quantity for the tank is 20,000 tons."

Many facility employees are active and participate in public and community groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and Rotary International.  Employees are also active in charity work including United Way, the Red Cross blood drive and March of Dimes.  In addition, staff members are active with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nCoffeyville Nitrogen employees recognize that community involvement and volunteerism is the most effective way to improve the communities in which they live.\n\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\nCoffeyville Nitrogen is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations.  We pledge to eliminate or reduce our use of toxic substances and to minimize our use of energy and the generation of all wastes to the extent technically and economically feasible.  We strive to prevent the generation of pollution at the source, but, where that cannot be achieved, we are committed to environmentally sound methods of recycling, treatment, and disposal.  By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace, and improve the environment.\n\nThe above goals were applied to the design and construction of the Coffeyville Nitrogen Plant.

A conventional natural gas based ammonia plant would consume 25,000 cubic feet for every ton of ammonia produced.  After considering these facts, Coffeyville Nitrogen chose to utilize Texaco Hydrogen Generation Process using coke as a feedstock.  Substituting coke for natural gas conserves over 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, which can be better used for home heating and electrical power generation.  Constructing our plant next to a refinery lowers the coke transportation cost.\n\nThe environmental design objective for this plant was to achieve significant emission reduction compared to the conventional nitrogen plant.  No hazardous solids will be produced during normal operations.  The water effluent will be clean enough to enter the Coffeyville's municipal water treatment system.  The air contaminant emissions will meet the requirements for a minor source under Title V of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 70 (K.A.R. 28-19-500). \n\nAdditional state-of-art safety features incorporated in the facility design will be described in the \"Synopsis of Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\" section below.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe gasification unit, ammonia synthesis unit and the UAN solution unit, along with the associated product ammonia storage and handling areas, constitute the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management Program rule.  Regulated substances include the primary product of the plant, anhydrous ammonia, which is also the main feed stock for urea-ammonium nitrate production.  In addition, flammable substances as a class, such as hydrogen produced by coke gasification, are regulated under Risk Management.

The rate of ammonia released is calculated from the vaporization rate from the liquid ammonia pool contain by the storage dike. A publicly available model (DEGADIS) which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release events modeled this unlikely event. This scenario has an off site impact.  Details of the results of this modeling are provided elsewhere in the Risk Management Plan Submittal. \n\nTo assure that the event indicated above was, in fact, the worst case as the rule defines it; failure of ammonia storage present at the site where ammonia is stored at higher pressure, but much lower quantities was also modeled.  In addition, a worst case failure of chlorine containers was similarly modeled.  Neither of these resulted in a distance greater than the circumstance noted above.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the probability of such an event as described by the worst case is nil.  Many identically constructed and similar size tanks are in existence all over the world and have been in service for many decades without structural failure. Facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nCoffeyville Nitrogen has taken extraordinary precautions to insure the atmospheric storage tank will never structurally fail.  The storage tank is completely enclosed in a second tank built to same design standards.  The walls and floor are doubled, only the roof is common to both tanks.

Atmospheric storage tanks leak very slowly compared to pressurize tanks, which in a real release event, allows time for mitigating actions. \n\nWorst Case Flammable\n\nAs the rule requires, the largest quantity flammable release and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion must be analyzed as the worst case for these substances.  In this facility, a failure releasing the entire contents of the ammonia synthesis loop constitutes the largest flammable release.  This quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look up Tables. Although large volumes of flammable gases are handled daily by the plant, actual in-process inventory is relatively small. This scenario has an off site impact.  Impact distance is relatively limited as a result.\n\nUnlike most conventional ammonia plants, the Coffeyville Nitrogen plant has all major loop relief valves discharge to a flare, significantly reducing the probability of a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nAlternate Case Toxics \n\n\tAmmonia\n\nMore reasonably likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Significantly lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards are present as they are through out the plant, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.  Such events can include failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario, modeled with the DEGADIS model for this facility is the accidental breakage of the four inch ammonia pipe that goes to the loading rack.
