Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n\n\n3.

The Accidental Release Program: The facility complies with Iowa Administrative Code Part 21, Chapter 43, Rule 43.6(200) relating to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. These regulations administered by the Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI/CGA G-2.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from the covered process in the past five years that have resulted in onsite or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities chemical inventory "
