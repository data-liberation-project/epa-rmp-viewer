Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Max Farm Service in Max, North Dakota are strongly committed to employee, public, and\r\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\r\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\r\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\r\nresponse efforts with the Max Fire Department, and McLean County, which provides additional\r\nemergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank, two 1,450-gallon nurse tanks and ten 1,000-gallon nurse\r\ntanks at our facility in Max, North Dakota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 36,465\r\ngallons (187,648.9 pounds) at 85% standard maximum storage capacity, including the capacity of\r\nthe on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at \r\n85% standard maximum storage capacity.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\r\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nMax Farm Service maintains a detailed record"
