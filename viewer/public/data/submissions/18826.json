              "Description": "The prevention program can be divided into 4 major sections: 1) Designing for Safety, 2) Operating Safely, 3) Maintaining safe operations, and 4) Auditing the operation.   Under section 1, part of the safeguards are industry items and part are items utilized by the City.  The chlorine cylinders are ruggedly designed and approved by the Department of Transportation.  The cylinders are equipped with pressure relief devices to prevent rupture of the cylinder if exposed to heat.  A protective cap covers the cylinder valves at all times when cylinder is not in use.  Special chlorine regulators are used which automatically shut off the flow of chlorine if the feed pipe breaks.  In addition, the chlorine cylinders and process piping are located and installed to minimize the potential damage from impact.  With regard to Section 2 (Operating Safely), the chlorine cylinders are unloaded and handled by special equipment designed specifically for cylinder handling.  The cylinders are stored and used away from flammable liquids and gases.  Trained operations personnel follow established procedures to connect or disconnect a chlorine cylinder.  They use proper tools and related safety equipment.  A chlorine monitor and alarm system alerts personnel to a chlorine leak in the chlorinator area.   Procedures with regard to Section 3 (Maintaining Safe Operations) include the following: Chlorine cylinders are inspected on a routine basis and approved by the Department of Transportation.  Gaskets, valves, and connections are visually inspected each time a chlorine cylinder is changed, and replaced at specific intervals.  Only one cylinder is connected to the process at each location to minimize the impact of a leak.  In Section 4 (Auditing the Operation) procedures include:  Chlorine suppliers undergo a safety inspection on a routine annual schedule.  A routine inspection schedule at each location insures the integrity of gaskets, gauges, and associated piping and equipment.",

      "SummaryText": "The City of Kilgore places great emphasis on safety and utilizing safe practices in handling the various chemicals used in the water treatment processes.  The City is committed to the safety and well being of its employees as well as the community.  This commitment comes from each employee, from the plant operators to the City Manager and City Commission.\n\nThe surface water treatment plant (SWTP) provides the facilities and equipment designed to treat the water pumped from the Sabine River.  The treated water from this plant is pumped into the City's distribution system to provide a safe supply of potable water for the residences, commercial and industrial facilities in the City.  This treatment is designed to meet the standards as set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to provide adequate treatment to the water.\n\nOne of the primary chemicals used in this treatment is chlorine, which is used in the disinfection of the treated water to kill any harmful bacteria in the water supply.  Chlorine is a greenish yellow gas with a sharp, irritating, bleach-like odor.  At low concentrations chlorine becomes colorless but it retains its characteristic odor.  It is commonly used to disinfect water and wastewater, bleach woodpulp, and to make other chemicals.  Before chlorine became widely used as a disinfectant early in this century, waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid killed hundreds of thousands every year.  In 1900, 25,000 people died from typhoid just in the United States.  Due to chlorine, these deaths in the U.S. were reduced to fewer than 20 in 1960.  Long term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health effects from inhalation.   In high enough concentrations, chlorine will cause severe irritation to the eyes, coughing and difficulty breathing.  Chlorine does not burn but will support combustion (lets other articles burn)"

      "SummaryText": ". The vapors are much heavier than air and tend to settle in low areas.\n\nThe City maintains a supply of not more than 4000 lbs. (2 cylinders of 1 ton capacity each) at the wastewater treatment plant.\n\nTo evaluate the potential hazards to the community, two scenarios were considered as required.  These scenarios were evaluated using the EPA's RMP Comp modeling program.  The first, or worst case scenario, assumes a complete failure of one of the 1 ton chlorine cylinders, releasing the entire contents into the surrounding area within 10 minutes.  If this were to happen, the estimated distance the chlorine gas would travel would cover a radius of approximately 1.3 miles from the source, and could affect an estimated 710 people.\n\nThis scenario is highly unlikely, due to the industry safeguards designed into the cylinders.  For example, chlorine cylinders are ruggedly designed and DOT approved.  A protective cap covers the cylinder valves at all times when the cylinder is not in use.  The cylinders are also equipped with pressure relief devices to prevent rupture of the cylinder if exposed to heat.  Special chlorine regulators are used which automatically shut off the flow of chlorine if the feed pipe breaks.  Additionally, chlorine cylinders and process piping are located and installed to minimize the potential damage from impact.  A chlorine gas sensor and alarm system also provide warning of a leak in the chlorinator area.\n\nAnother more reasonable scenario evaluated for emergency planning purposes involves having one of the = inch valves used to withdraw chlorine from the cylinder break off.  Should this happen, the estimated distance the chlorine gas would travel would be to a radius of about 0.1 miles, possibly affecting approximately 5 people according to the model.  The same safeguards mentioned above, as well as the prevention program outlined below, also make the likelihood of this happening significantly low.\n\nThe City is in compliance with the rules for extreme"

General emergency response practices include the following: \n\n- The City maintains a community emergency notification plan. \n- Response is coordinated with emergency response agencies in the community.\n- The City has radio communication capability with County emergency response agencies.\n- A telephone emergency notification system is being put into operation to provide quick, concise emergency information to the City's near neighbors.\n- Emergency response personnel regularly take training to comply with all federal, state, and local requirements.\n\nResponse practices specific to chlorine include the following:\n\n- Wa"
