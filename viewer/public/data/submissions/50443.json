Four containers are connected to vacuum regulators, rotometers and water vacuum ejectors.  The system is completely under vacuum.  If the vacuum is lost for any reason, a spring loaded valve on each of the regulators immediately closes to stop the flow of chlorine gas.  The chlorine storage system is monitored by two independent leak detection systems.\n\nListed below is a brief description of BTMUA.'s risk management program as it pertains to the location detailed above.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n1. The goal of BTMUA's Risk Management Program (RMP) is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental release of chlorine.  BTMUA's delineation of this RMP element details responsibilities which involve Directors and Supervisors.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n2. BTMUA's RMP includes chlorine information on its toxicity, physical data, permissible exposure limits, reactivity data, corrosivity data, and thermal and chemical stability data.  Information concerning the chlorination process chemistry, maximum inventory, safe upper and lower limits for temperature, pressures and flows or compositions, evaluation of consequences of deviations, piping and instrumentation diagram, materials of construction, electrical classification, ventilation system design, design codes and standards, safety systems, electrical one-line diagram, site plan, fire and sewer water system piping diagrams and external forces and events data are included in this element.

BTMUA has conducted Chlorination Process Hazard Analysis to identify, evaluate and control the risk associated with the hazards of the chlorination process.  Process Hazard Analysis Documentation includes analysis reports, dispersion modeling reports, action timetables and a record of meetings held in which process hazard analysis results are communicated. The Director of Water Quality implements the PHA planning in coordination with the Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor and Regulatory Compliance/Health and Safety Supervisor.  These PHA's are conducted and thoroughly reviewed and re-validated at least every five (5) years following the completion of the initial report by an in-house hazard analysis team.\n\nSTANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP'S)\n4.  The purpose of this RMP element is to ensure that BTMUA maintains up-to-date accurate, written SOP's that provide clear instructions for our chlorination system.  All procedures will contain simplified operating instructions as well as any attachments.  These procedures are reviewed annually to certify that they accurately reflect current operating practice.  Any revisions to SOP's that include changes in our process chemical, technology and equipment and facility changes will be addressed in our management of change.  The Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor has overall responsibility for implementing this element in coordination with Regulatory Compliance/Health and Safety Supervisor.\n\nEXTRAORDINARILY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE (EHS) OPERATOR TRAINING\n5.

The purpose of this RMP element is to ensure the continued integrity of all the chlorination process equipment.  The BTMUA PM Program identifies the direct and indirect EHS equipment as well as establishing, following and maintaining maintenance, inspection and testing schedules for this equipment.  The Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor has the overall responsibility for implementing this RMP Element.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n7.  The purpose of this RMP is to ensure that BTMUA's chlorination process system changes are properly reviewed against original system design specifications.  This is to determine that these changes can be accomplished safely and the chlorination system is ready to operate safely in accordance with original system design intent following the implementation of the change.  Included in this element is document review, PHA development, employee training and record keeping.  The Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor has the overall responsibility for this element in coordination with the Regulatory Compliance/Health and Safety Supervisor.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW (PSSR)\n8.

The purpose of this RMP element is to ensure audits are performed to evaluate that BTMUA's chlorination process safety and risk management programs, and their implementation for compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA/TCPA Risk Management Program Regulations.  This audit is completed annually under the direction of the Director of Water Quality in coordination with the Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor, and the Regulatory Compliance/Health and Safety Supervisor.\n\nACCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n10. All chlorine leak accidents or potentially catastrophic events at the Authority will be promptly investigated.  The purpose of the accident investigation element is to identify the underlying causes of an accident and to implement corrective actions to prevent the accident from reoccurring.  The Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for initiating this RMP element and ensures that any resulting corrective actions are addressed and documented. \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION PLAN\n11.
