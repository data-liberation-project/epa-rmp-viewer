The area is secured with crash posts and the ton containers are secured to stands in case of an earthquake.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased upon the Hazard Assessment Addendum (April 2004) the five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there have been no reportable releases of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Tri-County Pool Service, Inc.'s action plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Tri-County Pool Service, Inc. has a B-kit available at the facility for the HAZMAT team's use in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nTri-County Pool Service has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (May 2004) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (May 2004).  All recommendations resulting from the audit will be completed by December 2004.  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation revealed that no necessary modifications are needed to ensure a safe operation. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
