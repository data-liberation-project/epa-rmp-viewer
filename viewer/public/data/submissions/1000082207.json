Executive Summary\r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental release and emergncy response policies.\r\n\r\nAt this facility,handles the requlated substance, hydrogen chloride. The delivery vehicles are unloaded, the containers stored and then delivered to the final user. Hydrogen chloride is considered hazardous under both Oregon and Federal regulations. Rinchem Company, manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices(e.g. alarms,relief devices)inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the facility. \r\n\r\nOur emergency action program is based upon OSHA's 1910.38 regulation. The emergency action plan includes procedrues for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by the local emergency responders to control accidental releases. \r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\r\n\r\n1.2 The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and redelivery of a variety or compressed gases and chemicals to the end user. The Hydrogen Chloride is a regulated substance that is handled in quanties that exceed the EPA and Oregon State thresholds for regulated substances. \r\n\r\n1.3 The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.

Retraining is conducted annually.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Procedure Manual that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release. This information also contains the names and numbers of responding outside agencies.  Emergency actions and response for flammable releases have been coordinated with Tualatin Valley Fire Department.  \r\n\r\n1.6 Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHA and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
