      "SummaryText": "1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCity Utilities has an effective chlorine safety program. The key components include contingency planning, on-site monitoring, emergency shutoff equipment, and specialized operation and maintenance procedures.  A strong emphasis on staff training reinforces these elements. For many years CU has been called upon to share expertise and training techniques with local fire departments and other water utilities in the region.\n\n\n\nThe Fulbright hazardous materials (HazMat) emergency response plan covers all chemicals used at the facility. This plan addresses accident scenarios during both normal operating hours and nights and weekends. The plan is integrated with the Greene County Emergency Management response plan. This relationship with the countywide plan has been tested through full-scale mock emergency training. The plan is updated as needed to account for organizational changes and is completely reevaluated every three years.\n\n\n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Fulbright Water Treatment Plant provides drinking water to the metropolitan area of Springfield, Missouri.  The plant is located at 3920 North Farmer Road. Important steps in the water treatment process include taste and odor control, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, chlorination, pH adjustment, and fluoridation. Some of these steps require the addition of chemicals such as powdered activated carbon, potassium permanganate, polyaluminum chloride polymer, chlorine, fluoride, and soda ash.\n\n\n\nThis plan centers on the use of chlorine at the Fulbright Plant. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas with a bleach-like odor. It is used extensively as a disinfectant in public drinking water, swimming pools, and cooling water systems due to its ability to react with readily oxidizable compounds. Bacteria, viruses, and other harmful organisms are effectively deactivated by disrupting their biochemical processes. Chlo"

      "SummaryText": "rine gas is added to the raw water during the treatment process and to the finished water prior to distribution. Unlike many disinfectants, chlorine stays in the water providing residual protection as it travels through the distribution system.\n\n\n\nWhile the use of chlorine as a disinfectant is a safe, industry-standard practice, drinking water workers must take special precautions to prevent the gas from escaping. In its vapor form the oxidant can attack skin, eye, and lung tissues. The resulting damage can be serious, irreversible, and even fatal at high concentrations. The potential hazard is greatest in the immediate working area near the gas cylinders; but in a large-scale release the gas could disperse and pose an exposure risk to people and property near the plant grounds. City Utilities has never experienced such an event involving any chemicals at this facility.\n\n\n\n1.3 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nInside the chlorine containment building, each cylinder is equipped with an emergency shutoff valve. These valves may be activated remotely by the Plant Operator to stop the flow of chlorine if the monitors detect a continuous release. This could prevent a prolonged escape of pressurized gas. The valves are designed to close automatically either on command or when there is a power loss to the building.\n\n\n\nCity Utilities' written operating and maintenance procedures manual addresses the safe handling of chlorine cylinders. The manual draws extensively on CU's safe handling experience as well as on guidance from professional organizations such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the Chlorine Institute. A proper respect for the chemical, adequate knowledge of chemical properties, proper use of tools, and good communication between employees are all important to accident prevention. These and other issues are addressed in the written procedures for the Fulbright plant. \n\n\n\n1.4 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nCity"

      "SummaryText": " Utilities has not experienced a chlorine accident at either of its drinking water facilities in the past five years.  \n\n\n\n1.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nChlorine is added to the water from a central storage and injection system located in a totally enclosed and fireproof building situated over 945 feet from the closest property boundary.  It is equipped with a gas detection and monitoring system that operates on two levels of safety.\n\n\n\nThe Fulbright HazMat emergency response plan can be activated either through the monitoring and alarm system noted above or by human detection. In either case, the plan calls for immediate notification of the appropriate public response agencies.  Small chlorine leaks can be repaired immediately by properly trained and equipped Fulbright personnel.  However, leaks judged to be large enough for potential off-site consequences are assigned to the Springfield Fire Department HazMat response team. During a Fire Department response, some Fulbright employees would be deployed to help monitor offsite vapor dispersion and contain any chlorine-laden runoff. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.6 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCity Utilities identified three specific improvements to the chlorine safety system at Fulbright during its 2009 review.  These included upgrading the emergency lighting at the chlorine building, upgrading vehicle protection through the use of Jersey barriers or similar safety barricades, and the addition of one more chlorine detector at the north end of the chlorine building.  CU completed these improvements in calendar year 2010.  We continue to examine disinfection safety options and implement any new measures deemed appropriate for our system.   \n\n\n\n1.7 CONCLUSION\n\nCity Utilities places a high priority on the need to safely handle all chemicals at all locations, including the Fulbright Water Treatment Plant.  CU is proud of the plant safety record, with respect both to chemical usage and general work practices. We are confident in the moni"
