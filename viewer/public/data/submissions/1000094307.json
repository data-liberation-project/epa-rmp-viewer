If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Bethel Township Hose Company and the Delaware County LEPC, as appropriate through the 911 Service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of Concord 59 and Talleyville 25 (both Basic Life Support Units) or Medic 104 (Advanced Life Support unit) via 911 for ambulance service.  The primary hospital response is provided through Crozier Chester Medical Center with support through Riddle Hospital.  The Facility is not currently designated a \"responding\" facility, however, the Facility maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response teams to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nLaurel Pipe Line Company, L.P.- Booth Station is a refined product pipeline breakout station, including the butane blending system (direct injection into the pipelines).  The Risk Management Plan covers the butane blending system including three 60,000 gallon vessels, truck offloading stations, and associated sampling and transfer equipment.\n\n\n\nLaurel Pipe Line Company, L.P.- Booth Station complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D - Program Level 3).  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all 14 elements) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).\n\n\n\nTo date, this Facility has never had an accident or incident involving the butane blending system resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmenta"
