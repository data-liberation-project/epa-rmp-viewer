      "SummaryText": "Giant Resource Recovery - Arvonia, Inc. (GRR) operates a fully RCRA-permitted hazardous waste derived fuel storage and blending facility on an apprximate 0.56 acre parcle of land wholly contiguous to an adjacent lightweight aggregate manufacturing operation (Solite, LLC) in Arvonia, VA.  Liquid waste fuel is received at the GRR facility via tanker truck from off-site and pumped into one of several waste fuel blending tanks.  In addition, containerized waste, including waste aerosol cans, are received via box trailer and processed in a can processing operation.  The containerized waste is crushed and separated into three streams: 1) drained liquid contents, 2) propellant gases (if applicable), and 3) scrap steel.  The liquid waste fuels are blended to meet burning specifications for use as fuel at the adjacent Solite facility for the production of lightweight aggregate.  The propellant gases are also used as a fuel in the Solite process.\n\nThe GRR facility consists of 15 storage tanks, ancillary equipment, and the container management facility including the can processing operation.  Waste fuels (liquid and gaseous) are transferred to the Solite facility via pipeline.  The GRR storage tanks and can processing units are interconnected via pipelines and are also considered co-located within the facility and therefore, for purposes of compliance with 40 CFR Part 68, the GRR facility is considered to have one regulated process, the GRR tank farm and container processing facility.\n\nThe threshold quantity determination performed at the GRR facility used several conservative assumptions as outlined in the EPA RMP guidance document for warehousing (1/99).  From this threshold determination, the facility developed a list of regulated substances that could potentially (although unlikely) be present in the regulated process above the applicable threshold quantity as follows:  acrylontrile, allyl alcohol, ammonia, carbon disulfide, chloroform, methyl chloride, methyl mercaptan, t"

From this analysis it was determined that the facility did not have any public receptors within the distance to the endpoint for the worst case toxic release scenaro.  In addition, the facility has not had any reportable accidents under RMP and therefore, the facility is subject to the RMP Program 1 requirements.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that although the GRR facility is subject to the Program 1 requirements of RMP (and is reporting accordingly), to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances at the stationary source, it has implemented an internal risk management program (and associated prevention program), using the Program 2 Prevention Program requirements as a guide.  The Risk Management Program is intended to address all potential hazards and comply with the general duty clause of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe GRR prevention program includes 1) the development of a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program, 2) the performance of a hazard review, 3) the development of standard operating procedures for the regulated process (including maintenance procedures), 4) the implementaion of a risk management program training plan, 5) the performance of compliance audits and incident investigations, and 6) procedures for maintaining and updating safety information for the process and regulated constituents.\n\nIn addition, as a RCRA permitted facility, GRR has developed and implemented a Contingency Plan in accordance with the federal RCRA regulations at 40 CFR Part 264.  These plans are maintained on site and have been coordinated with the local emergency response agencies.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the facility include ongoing training of employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the regulated pr"
