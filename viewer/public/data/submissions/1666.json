FACILITY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY.\n\n      THE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF TWIN COUNTY SERVICE COMPANY ARE COMMITTED TO \n      THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTIAL\n      RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT.,\n      OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE \n      TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. \n\n2.   THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n      THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR \n      SALE TO FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED,  STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR \n      DIRECT APPLICATION AS A CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENT.\n\n3.   THE WORSE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n      THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO  WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A\n      STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED \n      WOULD BE 140,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK\n      AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n\n      THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS 2.5 MILES.\n\n      THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A \n      RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.\n\n      THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS .19 MILES. THIS\n      RELEASE HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING  BEYOUND THE FACILITY BOUNDARY.\n\n4.   THE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n      THIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH EPA'S ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION RULE AND WITH ALL\n      APPLICABLE STATE CODES AND REGULATIONS.  THIS HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF\n      SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1,"
