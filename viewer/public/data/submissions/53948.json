If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency reponse plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.0  Facility Information\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage and sale of fertilizers and the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.  Aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Aqua ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 27,000-gallon aboveground storage tank.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 204,500 pounds of 24% solution. \n\n3.0 Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario is the failure of the aqua ammonia storage tank filled to the greatest amount.  This scenario would release 204,500 pounds of aqua ammonia within the secondary containment dike.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, based on a more plausible potential incident, is the release from a transfer hose break with an increased wind speed and atmosheric stability class D.\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Facility implements the provisions of the Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1 published by the American National Standards Institute, inc.; the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as they apply to aqua ammonia st"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. Specific changes to the aqua ammonia process at the Facility will be implemented as needed."
