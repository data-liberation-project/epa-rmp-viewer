The facility is located at 625 E. US \nHighway 36. Equistar employs approximately 137 full time employees at the plant site.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary \nsource (' 68.155a):\n\nEquistar is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public \nand the environment.  As part of this commitment, Equistar has established a system to help \nensure safe operation of the processes at the Tuscola Plant. One component of this system is a \nrisk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with \nthe requirements of the Environmental Protection (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental \nRelease Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule); and the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) \nStandard (29 CFR 1910.119).

A team composed of personnel with \nengineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis \nexperience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses \nthe HAZOP and what-if checklist techniques to perform this analysis.  The PHA team \nprepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of \nrecommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit \npersonnel and, as appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are \nimplemented.\n\nC)  Operating Procedures\n\nTuscola Plant engineers, operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain \noperating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely \nperformed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as \nreference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and \nprocess upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n     Steps for safely conducting activities \n     Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and \n          consequences of process deviations\n     Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective \n          equipment requirements and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance \n          occurs\n     Plant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of \n          operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency \n          shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary \n          operations.\n\nD)  Training\n\nThe Tuscola Plant trains its workers"
