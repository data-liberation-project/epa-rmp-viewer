The Tanner family started out in the ammonia business in 1954 with the purchase of National Ammonia Company in Philadelphia, PA. The company has grown to its current size through the acquisition of three other ammonia companies, Bower Ammonia and Chemical Co. in 1971, Northeastern Ammonia Co. in 1985, and Hamler Industries in 1991. This particular facility was established in 2015.\n\n\n\nThe mission of Tanner Industries, Inc. is to constantly improve our products and services to meet or exceed our customer's needs, to distribute our products in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner, and to generate a reasonable return in order to provide continuity for the business and employment for our employees. \n\n\n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as it applies to the safe distribution of ammonia. Our commitment to Responsible Distribution (RD) provides our company with an integrated environmental, health, safety, security, and product stewardship program that is supported by our strong corporate capabilities. Our dedication to the proper distribution and stewardship of ammonia includes involvement in emergency response training for first responders and other industry personnel to enhance the protection of our employees and community neighbors. \n\n\n\nTanner Industr"

      "SummaryText": "ies, Inc. is a distributor of anhydrous ammonia. We are not a manufacturer. The material is transported to our facility by tank truck and then distributed to end-users. At this facility, we also distribute a product we call \"aqua ammonia\". This material, ammonium hydroxide, is a solution of ammonia and water , and is distributed in the same fashion as Anhydrous Ammonia .\n\n\n\nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\n\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses. The largest users of ammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a fertilizer. Some agricultural businesses combine ammonia and other chemicals and nutrients to form more complex fertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles, pharmaceuticals, cleaning solutions, dyes, inks and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used by some companies in various processes. Ammonia is recognized as an \"ozone safe\" refrigerant. This means that, unlike other refrigerants, any ammonia releases into the atmosphere will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Besides refrigeration, Ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, reprographics, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\n\n\n\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\n\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages.  Accompanied with a very pungent odor, ammonia can be said to be \"auto-repulsive\". These characteristics provide us with an early warning of the material's presence and force us to retreat from ammonia contaminated atmospheres.  High concentrations could have more serious health effects. These could include convulsive coughing, difficult and painful breathing, eye damage and in extreme cases, death. Liquid ammonia or ammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce serious chemical burns requiring prompt medical attention.\n\nEmp"

Tanner Industries, Inc. continuously searches for ways to improve safety performance.  The corporate safety committee is comprised of upper management, compliance personnel, headquarters employees, and field personnel that are familiar with plant processes. This committee meets on a regular basis to review accident and injury investigations, evaluate site specific issues, and provide recommendations and implementation guidance.  Also, qualified personnel periodically inspect and evaluate each facility to assess safety and maintenance conditions. The results of these facility inspections are reported directly to upper management and the operations department. As a whole, these systems provide Tanner Industries, Inc. with a continuous process for the identification of safety improvement opportunities thus reducing any risk to our society associated with a release of this important chemical.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Tanner Industries, Inc.
