The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in April 2007.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted on July 31, 1998.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations.

The management and employees of the Hillsboro facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Trichlorosilane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of Trichlorosilane into DOT containers for distribution to customers. Trichlorosilane is received and stored in a 6,000 gallon (67,200 lb) tank.  The Trichlorosilane is then filled into various size DOT containers for distribution to customers.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, would be the rupture of the 6,000 gallon Trichlorosilane Tank. The result would be a maximum release of 67,200 lbs of Trichlorosilane over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe Alternative release scenario was based on a release from a 550 lb container over a 10 minute period. Results were calculated using RMPComp.* version 1.07 and LandView V to determine effected population. Results can be gotten from contacting Linde, Hillsboro site and requesting to view documentation.\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the past five years. \n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Trichlorosilane.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\n  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the Trichlorosilane"
