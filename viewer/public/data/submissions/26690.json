Facility Policy\n\n    The management and employees of Farmers Union Cooperative Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Saline Co. LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 800,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  Worst Case Scenerio and Alternate release scenerio\n\n    a.  Tworst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10.0 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 120,000, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capapcity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point ( point of dispersiion to 200 ppm) is 4.70 miles.\n\n    B.  The alternate release scenario:  a 1 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenerio followed by the release of ammonia 1.0 minutes before and automatic excess flow shut down valve intervenes, or a remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 40. 0 lbs.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .02 mile.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n    The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8"

Emergency Action Plan\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.  A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b.  Provded state and local authorities with the emergency planning and the community right-to-know information and required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendation regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time ."
