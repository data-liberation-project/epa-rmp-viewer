Urban means that there are many obstacles in the area immediately surrounding the release including skyscrapers, buildings, or trees. Rural means that there are few buildings or other obstacles in the immediate area.\r\n\r\nEstimation of Distance to Toxic Endpoint\r\nThe following source was used to identify the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 mg/L).  The results of a 10-minute release from the Processing System's High-Pressure Receiver. The atmospheric stability class of F in a Urban area and a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second were considered. The distance to the toxic endpoint was found as 3.4 miles. \r\n \r\n2.2 ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE\r\nThe alternative release scenario presented is similar to the worst case in that it is a liquid release. The alternative release scenario chosen for this facility is that of a 0.25-inch diameter orifice leading to an airborne release, representative of a pump seal leak, a gasket rupture, pinhole leak due to corrosion, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, small vessel release etc. (this is representative of many release scenarios discussed during the Process Hazard Analysis). It is assumed that this release is from the high side of the system, therefore at a maximum pressure of 150 psig. The release scenario is assumed to last approximately 60 minutes (in which time the entire charge will be released). Passive mitigation was considered for the release as some ammonia equipment is located inside of building walls.\r\n\r\nRelease Rate Calculations\r\nFor modeling the alternative release scenario, the RMP regulation allows typical meteorological conditions at the facility to be used. For the alternative release scenario, a wind speed of 3 meters/second and neutral conditions, D stability, were used.  The alternate release rate is approximately 84.3 pounds per minute. Passive mitigation measures were not considered as this release could occur outside. This release rat"

      "SummaryText": "in an enclosure (building), the release rate to the outside atmosphere will be considerably less than if it were stored outside. In case of a release inside a building, the building can be considered to provide passive mitigation, unless:\r\n\r\n*The building may fail as a result of the release. This is unlikely except in the case of a large vessel in a very small room. As a rough rule of thumb, if the room volume divided by the quantity of ammonia released is less than the value of 0.1, there is a possibility that the release of ammonia will cause failures such as windows blowing out or doors blowing open.\r\n*The release takes place facing an opening in the building (door or windows). In this case, the door or windows will be assumed to be open, and the ammonia will be released through these openings.\r\n\r\nSince the largest vessel, the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) is located outside, a release from the vessel would not be mitigated by the building however, there is an emergency ventilation system in place which will automatically vent the ammonia vapors to the outside. Thus, passive mitigation effects were not taken into account for the worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nMeteorological Conditions\r\nFor the worst case scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and stable conditions (F class stability) were used, based on EPA requirements.\r\n\r\nRelease Rate Calculations\r\nThe initial release rate is derived by dividing the total quantity released evenly over a 10-minute duration. The High-Pressure Receiver is not capable of holding the system's entire ammonia charge of 200,000 pounds. The High-Pressure Receiver only holds 43,885 lbs., therefore the Worst-case will be based off of the amount of ammonia in this vessel. In 10 minutes, the release rate of ammonia to the outside environment in the worst-case scenario is 4,388.5 pounds per minute. This release rate will be used to determine the potential downwind distance for the Worst-Case scenario.\r\n\r\nRural vs. Urban Topography\r\nThe local to"

As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from this vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side. It also serves to hold the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not in operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0 POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nCSL Behring's refrigeration system is a closed system. Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  The off-site consequence modeling consists of both a worst case and an alternative case release scenario for the refrigeration system at the facility.  EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (April 2004) was used as the primary source to determine the downwind distances for each scenario.  Information regarding sensitive environmental receptors was gathered from ALOHA Version 5.4.7, Marplot 5.1.1 Mapping Software, and Yahoo Yellow Pages.  \r\n\r\n2.1 WORST-CASE RELEASE\r\nQuantity Released\r\nThe Worst-Case release scenario is a release of the total quantity of ammonia from the largest vessel (High Pressure Receiver) in the ammonia refrigeration system in 10 minutes, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity in the vessel. The receiver cannot hold the system's entire ammonia inventory as currently designed, so this amount was not assumed to be released for the worst-case scenario. \r\n\r\nRelease Duration\r\nThe first 10 minutes of the release for solutions under ambient conditions is required for estimating the off-site consequences, because the toxic component in a solution evaporates fastest during the first few minutes of a spill, when its concentration is highest.\r\n\r\nPassive Mitigation Measures\r\nIf the largest vessel in the process is stored"

      "SummaryText": "the refrigerant vapor releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid. The system basically moves heat from the low side to the high side. Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulated enclosure where goods or processes can be chilled or frozen.\r\nThe low side of the refrigeration system typically uses one or more evaporators to remove heat from the space or products to be cooled. An evaporator contains a set of continuous coils through which the refrigerant flows. Due to the low pressures and corresponding low temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant quickly evaporates, absorbing a great deal of heat from the surrounding area. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe low and high sides of the refrigeration system are separated by the compressor and the expansion valve. The compressor is the driving force of the system. It pulls refrigerant vapor from the evaporator (low side) at a rate that will maintain the evaporator pressure required for the desired operating temperature. At the same time it pressurizes the warm vapor and forces it into the condenser and the high side of the system. Refrigeration compressors on the market today are screw type, reciprocating, and centrifugal.\r\n\r\nExpansion valves regulate the flow of liquid refrigerant from the high side to the low side by causing a large pressure drop. These valves are located between the receiver (high side) and the evaporator (low side). These valves, coupled with the capacities of the compressor, can help regulate the pressure of the evaporator thereby creating the cooling capabilities of the system. The high side of the refrigeration system consists of a condenser and a receiver. Warm refrigerant vapor enters the condenser after it has been pressurized by the compressor. A condenser will typically use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n1.0 SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n1.1 SOURCE\r\nThe CSL Behring L.L.C., Bradley, Illinois, pharmaceutical manufacturing facility is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) (Chemical Abstract System [CAS] Number 7664-41-7). Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas at ambient conditions. The ammonia refrigeration system is used to control the processing and room temperature for plasma-derived and related products. It is a closed system that contains 198,689.70 pounds of ammonia.  For the purposes of this summary, this inventory will be rounded to approximately 200,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor). The vessel that can contains the largest volume of ammonia is the high-pressure (HP) receiver at approximately 43,885 lbs. Ammonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world. It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure. At this facility, ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment and its chemical properties allow for immediate detection and response.\r\n\r\n1.2 PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nA refrigeration system is used to reduce the temperature of a heat source. A mechanical refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. As the refrigerant absorbs large amounts of heat from the source, it changes from liquid to gas. At a different part of the system, the refrigerant releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid. This system is referred to as having two sides: a low pressure or low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high pressure or high side, where"
