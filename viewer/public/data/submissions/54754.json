Texas Petrochemicals Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its associates and neighbors. The PNO Plant maintains a working OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been built upon this existing PSM program.   The PNO Plant participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) Sabine-Neches Chiefs Association and the Port Neches Fire Department in assisting local officials in the development of emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with them.   The facility complies with all applicable codes and standards regarding operating and equipment safety. Texas Petrochemicals has participated in the past with the Responsible Care&reg; initiative ACC and is committed to the responsible management of chemicals.   The PNO Plant Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMP).\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled. The PNO Plant is located at the corner of Highway 136 and Highway 366 in Port Neches, Texas. The site began production in 1943 and was acquired by Huntsman in 1994 then Texas Petrochemicals, LLC in 2007.  The site produces the primary end product butadiene.  Butadiene is a monomer used in the production of butadiene rubber and various butadiene co-polymers.\r\n\r\nThe PNO Plant processes or stores volumes of a regulated flammable mixture containing the following:  1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methylpropene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-butene-cis, butane, ethane, isobutane, isopentane, methane, pe"

The only regulated toxic substance, in a quantity greater than the threshold amount, at the time of this submittal of the Risk Management Plan is chlorine. \r\n\r\nThe PNO stationary source is composed of two processes. They are identified as the Butadiene Process, which includes Receiving, Storage, and Transfer (RS&T), and the Steam, Power and Water (SP&W) process.\r\n\r\nThe Butadiene Process produces butadiene by extraction and distillation of crude butadiene purchased from various olefin plants. This process also produces a by-product stream (Raffinate-1). Receiving, Storage & Transfer (RS&T) consists of storage tanks, marine docks, and railcar facilities for, loading, unloading and storage of raw materials, intermediates, by-products and finished products.\r\n\r\nThe SP&W Process consists of utilities, including raw water treatment, steam boilers, wastewater treatment and cooling towers. The only part of the SP&W Process which is covered by PSM and RMP is that area which contains chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in cylinders and utilized for water treatment.\r\n\r\n3.  General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. Following is a brief summary of the elements that the PNO Plant has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by the EPA in the RMP Rule, as well as, with the OSHA PSM standard.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe PNO Plant maintains a compilation of written safety information.  This includes information pertaining to hazards of regulated substances, the technology of the covered process and the equipment in the covered process.\r\n \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe PNO Plant has performed initial process hazard analysis to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) and these hazard analysis apply to processes covered by RMP.  The PNO Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted metho"

Employees are assigned to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which are further evaluated and implemented where beneficial.  Recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The hazards imposed by hurricanes and inclement weather are minimally discussed during PHA's since this issue is well-covered by our Hurricane Preparedness Plan and Corporate Standards require designing equipment/structures to withstand high winds.\r\n \r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe PNO Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed by operations, and provide clear instructions for safely operating covered processes.  These operating procedures are available to all employees who work in the processes.  The procedures are reviewed annually and modified whenever needed to accommodate operational and process changes.\r\n \r\nTraining\r\nThe PNO Plant provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees who operate the processes to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  Training documentation provides records of when training was received and whether or not the training was understood. All operators receive periodic refresher training.\r\n\r\n \r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe PNO Plant has developed written procedures for maintaining the mechanical integrity of  equipment in the covered processes, including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps.
