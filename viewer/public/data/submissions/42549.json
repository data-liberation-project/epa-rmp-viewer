The hydrocarbon portion of the facility is owned by Enterprise Terminal & Storage, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mapletree, LLC and operated by Enterprise Products Operating L.P.  The anhydrous ammonia portion of the facility is owned by Magellan Midstream Partners L.P. and operated by Enterprise Products Operating L.P.\n\n\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n* Emergency Response Programs\n\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Whiting Terminal that are regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.  \n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe Whiting Terminal is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and anhydrous ammonia pipeline facility well as a propane and anhydrous ammonia storage/loading facility.

We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\n\n\nThe Whiting Terminal has three Department of Transportation ? regulated pipelines that are routed through the facility.  These three pipelines are a mixed natural gas liquids line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane), a dedicated natural gas liquids (propane) line and a dedicated anhydrous ammonia line.  These pipelines have pumps that are driven by gas turbines, which can add horsepower to the product transfer down the pipelines, or the pump system can be bypassed.  In addition there is one pipeline leg that comes off the dedicated propane pipeline and is the propane product supply line to the Enterprise Ogden Terminal and Storage facility.   The Whiting facility also receives propane from one of the two natural gas liquids pipelines to a single 90,000 gallon capacity storage tank.  This tank is used for distribution to the two truck transport loading docks which also has capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.\n\n\n\nThe Magellan anhydrous ammonia system receives anhydrous ammonia product off the anhydrous ammonia pipeline and is routed to their single 63,000 gallon storage tank.  Enterprise maintains and operates the system for Magellan.\n\n\n\nAll of the previously mentioned tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.\n\n\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is transported and stored at the facility via a dedicated anhydrous ammonia pipeline.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nThis simulation involves a complete failure of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the transfer loading hose on the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 2,500 pounds per minutes for 10 minutes after the hose break.  The simulation calculated that 25,000 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  The measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the "

Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the propane storage tank resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.  The entire inventory of the tank is simulated due to the proximity of the tanks relative to mitigation of the simulation.  This scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.

Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 30,500 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Monona County Sheriff?s Department Emergency Management District, which includes the local Whiting Police department, Monona County Sheriff?s Department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Monona County Sheriff?s Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from Houston Control which has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by operations personnel.  A third party contractor, 3E Company is under contract to contact the necessary agencies if required.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Our Process Safety Management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention program, including:\n\n\n\n* Process safety information\n\n* Process hazard analysis\n\n* Operating procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical integrity\n"

A training program has been developed in which Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the facility, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  Employees are trained on, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\n\n\nThere is an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies with the process equipment prior to any incident.\n\n\n\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\n\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.
