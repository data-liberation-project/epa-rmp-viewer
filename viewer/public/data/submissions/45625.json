      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of Collier County to maintain compliance, provide a reliable source of drinking water to our customers, take care of customers concerns and to ensure the safety of our team members.  In order to accomplish these goals the Collier County team works to ensure that all preventative and mitigation steps are taken so that customers and residents surrounding the South Regional Water Treatment Plant are safe.  Collier County also has a strong relationship with the first response agencies and has them conduct regular exercises on site to ensure that should there ever be an event that they are familiar with our facility.\n\nRegulated Substances\nThe primary activity at the South Regional Water Treatment Plant is to treat raw water to meet all potable drinking water standards.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility.  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility at a time is 30 tons.\n\nAccidential Release Prevention Program\nCollier County is in compliance with 40 CFR 68.  The County has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system as well as admnistrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures.  The County has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building; and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber to minimize the consequences of an accidential release.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThe SCRWTP has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Collier County Comprehensive Emergency Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that has been prepared in accordance with all local, state, and federal regulations.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Updates\nIn the 1999 submittal, there were a number of items that still needed to be accomplished that were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis.  The following is the items that were listed and the status on fulfilling the recommendations:\n\nTo be completed by August 1999\nA. Safeguards should be provided to prevent delivery trucks from c"

The chlorine piping system should be modified to isolate the pressure guage from the header to prevent a potential leak at the header pressure guage.  Status: Completed.\nC. Request Standard Operating Procedures and certifications that chlorine meets AWWA specifications from chlorine supplier. Status:  Completed.\nD. Spare injectors and check valves should be purchased and kept on site for backup in case of a failure.  Status: Completed.\nE. Emergency evacuation plan should be revised to include a second egress route as well as a reassembly area for personnel to meet.  A site coordinator should be assigned to every shift.  Status: Completed - on-going updates as shift assignments are alternated.\nF. Due to the chemical nature of chlorine any work performed in the chlorine areas that involves heat or sparks should be closely monitored. Hot work permit process should be implemeneted.  Status: Completed.\nG. A program for respirator maintenance and training that provides for purchase of spare parts and cartridge replacement should be implemented.  Status:  Completed set-up of program - on-going maintenance activities.\nH. The monorail used to move chlorine containers has a potential of sticking in place.  The monorail should be lubricated.
