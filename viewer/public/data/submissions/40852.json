(Precision) facility located in Los Angeles, California (see Figure 1) has been prepared to satisfy the following regulations:\n\u00bf California Office of Emergency Services, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\u00bf Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\n2. The purpose of this document is to facilitate the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by providing to the public and regulatory agencies information on regulated substances, a 5 year history of no accidents, potential offsite consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative release scenarios, and coordination with local emergency response agencies.\n\n3. The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is hydrofluoric acid (HF, 70 percent by weight).  The facility uses HF to clean and treat the surface of metals that may also be subject to the following onsite processes:\n\u00bf Rolling\n\u00bf Annealing\n\u00bf Slitting\n\u00bf Polishing\n\u00bf Cutting\n\u00bf Tempering\n \n4. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Data Elements are contained in Chapter 2.0 of the RMP.\n\n5. Information required in the RMP by the EPA Risk Management Program and the CalARP Program is summarized in Sections 1.2 through 1.6\n \n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n1. Precision has an existing Emergency Response Plan.  The plan provides emergency response organization, notification procedures, evacuation assembly locations, health hazards, and mitigation procedures.  The objective of the Emergency Response Plan is to avoid, or at least minimize, injuries to onsite and offsite persons, environmental damage, and property damage.\n\n2. The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updat"

Precision uses the following three acids that could potentially be classified as Regulated Substances under CalARP or federal regulations:  hydrofluoric, nitric and sulfuric.  The six largest storage and process situations that were evaluated to determine if an RMP was needed are listed in Table 1 along with the evaluation parameters. \n\n2. Only the storage of 70 percent by weight hydrofluoric acid in quantities up to thirty-two 55 gallon drums exceeds a threshold quantity (TQ).  The federal TQ for HF in concentrations equal to or greater than 50 percent is 1,000 pounds (lbs).  The amount of stored HF can reach 17,568 lbs.\n\n3. All other process and storage quantities of acids fall below threshold requirements of concentration, partial pressure or physical/chemical state of the acid (e.g., anhydrous gas).\n\n1.4 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n1. The basic approach to accidental release prevention is attention and a well-organized and diligently followed preventive maintenance program.  Employees are taught to pay attention to all processes, including storage, that utilize HF or other hazardous chemicals.  Forklift drivers are taught to be especially careful in their use of these machines to handle drums of acids and other hazardous loads.\n\n2. Acid baths in the pickling system are visually monitored daily to assure that acid level is maintained at least 4 inches below the tank top to provide ample freeboard space.  This freeboard will prevent acid spilling during an earthquake.\n\n3. The sulfuric acid system for wastewater treatment has an acid level probe in the storage tank.  An alarm (horn and light) will activate if the acid reaches a preset high level or low level in the storage tank.\n\n4. Table 2 lists 14 specific preventive maintenance checks and the schedule for these checks, for more complete inspections, and for repair or replacement of selec"

The accident history researched back 5 years shows that the facility has not had an accidental release or \"near miss\" of HF, the regulated substance subject to this RMP.\n\n\n1.5  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n1.5.1  GENERAL\n1. This section covers the procedures to be followed by Precision personnel in the event of an emergency.  The operator(s) on duty assess the situation, decide on the plan to follow, and then carry out the plan in an orderly, controlled manner.  The operator is the only one who can assess the situation as it occurs.  Therefore, should the operator feel that a change in procedure is justified due to the events as they happen, he will make the changes required.  The operator will discuss these changes with the Environmental Manager later, so that procedures are revised, if appropriate.\n\n1.5.2  DEFINITIONS\n1. Emergency:  An occurrence of such magnitude that normal operations cannot continue.\n \n1.5.3  HANDLING AND CLEANUP OF LEAKS OR SPILLS\n1. In addition to the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), the spill cleanup procedure is included in the Hazardous Material Spill Response Procedures Section of the Health and Safety Manual.\n\n\n1.5.4  NOTIFICATION\n1. In the event of a significant spill outside of the design containment area, the operator, or his designated representative, shall make notifications to agencies as required by regulations.\n\n\n1.5.5  EARTHQUAKE\n1. In the event of an earthquake, there is nothing the operator can do while the quake is happening, save protect himself from injury.  However, once the quake has subsided there are certain procedures that will be followed.  These consist of checking for acid leaks or mechanical damages.\n\n\n1.6  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n1. As a result of evaluations conducted by Precision and a study of the outcome of the HAZOP, several changes to improve safety are being considered.  Recognizing that safety improvements are most likely to be imple"

Included among these steps are operator-oriented actions to:\n\u00bf Conduct periodic inspections of key components when working in the area.  For example, operators would be asked to visually assess the piping at and around the sulfuric acid storage tank for signs of leaks, and the floor of the diked area containing the hydrofluoric acid 55-gallon drums in the storage building for evidence of liquid.\n\u00bf Observe the available freeboard in the pickling tanks when adding the required materials to the tanks.\n\u00bf Observe any discrepancies in operating procedures, including those by vendors delivering chemicals, and report these immediately to the Environmental Manager and Shift Foreman; assist such vendors in rectifying these discrepancies.\n\n3. In addition, Precision will implement the recommended actions from the HAZOP; these include specific items related to equipment components and procedures."
