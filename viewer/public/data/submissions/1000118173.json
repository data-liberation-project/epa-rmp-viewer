The Jeffrey Energy Center is located northwest of the city of St. Marys, Kansas at 25905 Jeffrey Road. The property surrounding the Jeffrey Energy Center is rural. \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are addressed in the individual RMP procedures which detail the RMP program requirements as well as how the Jeffrey Energy Center complies with the applicable requirements. The Jeffrey Energy Center is a nonresponding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nEvergy Jeffery Energy Center (Evergy JEC) maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities. The listed RMP rule threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds. Evergy stores the chemical in three (3) tanks. The storage and management of anhydrous ammonia for both systems is addressed in this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the Jeffery Energy Center as an air pollution control additive, to reduce the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to the atmosphere from the unit boilers. Each boiler unit is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device. \n\nThe ammonia storage tanks are filled by a tanker truck at a dedicated loading station. For the NOx control systems, liquid ammonia from the storage tanks is forwarded to a vaporizer skid, regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the Unit 1 flue within the ammonia injection grid. In combination with the catalyst in the selective catalytic reduction unit, nitrogen oxides are reacted and emissions of the pollutant are reduced. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-"

Evergy complies with the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and is subject to Program 3 requirements for anhydrous ammonia. The following sections provide a brief overview of the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nEvergy JEC maintains a record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the ammonia processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Evergy JEC maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nEvergy JEC has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nEvergy JEC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, storage"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  \n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at Evergy to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review [PSSR] [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routinely at Evergy. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nEvergy conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nEvergy promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nEvergy believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort."

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Evergy has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nThe Jeffery Energy Center has not had any RMP-reportable accidents in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nEvergy JEC maintains an Emergency Action Plan along with periodic training that details procedures for how to handle emergency situations quickly and effectively with minimum hazard to the employees involved. In addition to protecting employee safety, the procedures are in place to minimize damage to equipment, minimize interruption of operations, and coordinate outside response to emergency situations.
