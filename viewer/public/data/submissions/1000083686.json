Ethane rejection can be achieved with minimal process changes and allow for a maximum ethane recovery of 15% while maintaining propane recovery of > 91.5%.\r\n\r\nThe Panola III Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.  Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Panola III Gas Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and pentane.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.\r\n\r\nWe have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility since there are no receptors within the calculated worst case distance.  Additionally, there have been no incidents with offsite consequences in the last five years, and emergency response activities are coordinated with the local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Panola III Gas Plant. The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM Standard.  \r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Panola III Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.

The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for Panola III Gas Plant is coordinated with the Panola County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  Panola III Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPanola III Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at Panola III Gas Plant.\r\n\r\n* There currently no planned changed to improve safety."

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark- producing activities (hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nPanola III Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\r\n* Fire detectors on gas compression equipment\r\n* Plant video surveillance system\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\r\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\r\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\r\n* Dual mechanical seals with seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\r\n* Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\r\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, hard ha"
