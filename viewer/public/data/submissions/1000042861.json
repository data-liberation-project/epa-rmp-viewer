      "SummaryText": "A.  S.D. Warren is committed to operating the Somerset Mill in Skowhegan, Maine in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  S.D. Warren has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases.  S.D. Warren has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the plant to respond to potential releases.\n\n\n\nB. The plant provides bleach kraft pulp from a single continuous Kamyr digester and a Bleach Plant.  In 1982, the first of three high-speed, lightweight coated paper machines was built, followed by additional paper machines in 1986 and 1990.  The plant currently produces approximately 1,650 tons/day of bleach pulp, which is used in the production of approximately 2,400 tons/day of bleached fine kraft paper.  The plant has two power boilers and two turbine generators which supply steam and electricity for the plant's operations.  Excess electricity can be supplied to the local utility.  The plant has its own onsite wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and a solid waste disposal facility.  The plant is located adjacent to the Kennebec River from which it draws approximately 25,000,000 gallons a day to support operations.  The water is treated in an on-site water treatment facility before use.   A 1.2% concentration aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide is stored on-site in four 110,000 gallon tanks and used to bleach pulp and is the only RMP covered substance at the plant.\n\n\n\nC. The Plant is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA PSM program for the chlorine dioxide processes.  These include programs related to: Employee Participation; Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nD.

      "SummaryText": "There have been no incidents in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nE. The Plant has trained responders on-site for small releases and relies on the Skowhegan Fire Department and the Somerset County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for more extensive releases.\n\n\n\nF. The Mill has a very strong safety program both at the plant and throughout the organization.  Somerset has implemented the OHSAS 18001:2007 Occupational Health and Safety Management System. The Safety Management System integrates processes for improving and controlling practices that support a safe and healthy work environment.  On December 5, 2005 the mill was granted ISO 14001 Certification. ISO 14001 is a standard for environmental management systems to be implemented in any business, regardless of , location or income.  The aim of the standard is to reduce the environmental footprint of a business and to decrease the pollution and waste a business produces by implementing a program of continuous improvement.  The ISO 14001 environmental management standards exist to help organizations minimize how their operations negatively affect the environment. In order for an organization to be awarded an ISO 14001 certificate they must be externally audited by an audit body that has been accredited by an accreditation body.  The 14001 program was last audited on May 19-21, 2014."
