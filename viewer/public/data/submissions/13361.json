The City's program provides all information necessary to properly manage the regulated chemical - Chlorine. Plant Personnel are trained in the safe handling and use of Chlorine and are provided with the necessary safety equipment for working in proximity with this substance. It is the City's policy to utilize the City of Pompano Beach Fire Department's HAZMAT team to respond to all major emergency conditions.\n\nThe City's Water Treatment Plant is a 40 mgd lime softening treatment process which serves the City of Pompano Beach service area.  The plant utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection of the potable water prior to distribution.  The maximum quantity of chlorine stored on-site is 32,000 lbs. in the form of 16 1-ton cylinders.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the release of 2,000 lbs. of chlorine gas from a ruptured ton cylinder.   Area of impact is a 2.6 mile radius from the chlorine storage facility.  In the unlikely event of this release, off-site impacts will occur and include risk to public and private receptors, such as schools, businesses, parks, airport, hospital and residences.  There are no off-site environmental impacts associated with this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of 780 lbs. of chlorine gas from a leaking transfer hose.  Area of impact is a 938-yard radius from the chlorine storage facility which will impact parks, schools and airport.  There are no off-site environmental impacts associated with this scenario.\n\nThe City's Water Treatment Plant complies with all requirements stipulated in EPA 40 CFR Part 68 \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Program\" and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\".\n\nThere have been no accidental release of ch"
