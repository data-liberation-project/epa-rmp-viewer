Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices. To insure safe operation and release prevention at Club Chef, Covington, KY., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system.   To insure proper response to emergency situations, Club Chef, Covington, KY., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n     Ammonia:     We have 2 High Pressure receivers located in the plant containing a total amount of anhydrous ammonia equaling 19,500 pounds. \n \n\n                                                       \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\nWorst-case scenario - Failure of high-pressure receiver when full releasing 9,500 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high-pressure receiver will be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation occurs on the average of 1 time per year.  Therefore the possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 1% of the time.  This is a new facility has never had a failure of a high-pressure receiver.  The loss of 9,500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 1.80 miles before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative release scenario - An upset con"

The loss of 3000 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 0.2 miles before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system is equipped with high-pressure cutouts that help to prevent releases of this nature.  Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations' Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems Club Chef has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Club Chef uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators.  \n\n5.  Five-year accident history\n\nNo accidents\n\n6.   The emergency response program.    \n\nA fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team will be provided by the Covington, Kentucky Fire Department's Hazmat Unit.  This response plan was reviewed by the Director of Public Safety, Homeland Security and Emergency Management. This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge.  Also Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment,"
