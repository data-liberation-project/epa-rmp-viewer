Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Tri County FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled. \n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 1,200,000 pounds, this includes the maximum capacity of the storage tank.\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release  Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc, as adopted by state regulation and standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n4. Five year accident history.\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: \n\n    -have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n    -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite death, injuries, evacuation, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.
