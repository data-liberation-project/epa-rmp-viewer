The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the processes at the facility is 311412.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code for the processes at the facility is 2038. \r\n\r\nThe process area of the facility is located at:\r\nLatitude: 41 deg. 41 min. 50 sec. North\r\nLongitude: -88 deg. 00 min. 54 sec. West \r\n\r\nAnyhydrous ammonia is the material used in the frozen pizza refrigeration system.  The system has a total capacity of 15000 pounds.  The largest vessel located inside the building (HTRP-1) may contain as much as 6600 pounds.   \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nRMP/PSM Prevention Program provides information and procedures to prevent or minimize an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. The following ammonia refrigeration process equipment is covered: piping, condensers, evaporators, compressors, etc. The next compliance audit of the RMP/PSM Program will occur in August 2013 (three (3) years).

PSI enables Home Run Inn employees and contractors to identify and understand the potential hazards in the ammonia refrigeration system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Review (PHA) \u00bf Home run Inn has developed a site-specific PHA Program which is a formal study designed to analyze the process and identify potential hazards. In addition, this program has been established to ensure PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and to ensure findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. A What if/Checklist approach was taken. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures \u00bf Home run Inn has developed site-specific written operating procedures that provide detailed, clear instructions describing the steps that should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system. \r\n\r\nTraining \u00bf Home run Inn has developed a site-specific Training Program that ensures employees operating the ammonia refrigeration process have the knowledge to safely operate all aspects of the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the potential causes of process problems.

This Program also makes provisions to ensure that a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly reviewed and addressed.\r\n \r\nCompliance Audit \u00bf Home Run Inn has developed a site-specific Compliance Audit Program to ensure that compliance audits are conducted at a minimum of every three years to verify that Home Run Inn\u00bfs PSM/RMP Program is in place and working properly; and that practices and procedures are adequate and are being followed. The Compliance Audit Program also ensures that regular audits are performed. \r\n\r\nHot Work Permits \u00bf Home Run Inn has developed and implemented a Best Management Practice for hot work.

The MOC Procedure ensures that changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented and communicated. \r\n\r\nPre-startup Review (PSSR) \u00bf Home run Inn has developed a site-specific Pre-startup Safety Review Program that is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the process is started. A PSSR is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI) \u00bf Home Run Inn has developed a site-specific Mechanical Integrity Program that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training. The MI Program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration system is built, used, and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigati"

Their main responsibilities are spelled out in each section within this Program, but in general is to comply with the requirements set forth in this written document.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolicies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Home Run Inn. This RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Home Run Inn is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner thereby reducing risks to human health and the environment. It is Home Run Inn\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses a potentially catastrophic chemical release that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes a Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures that are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\r\n\r\nAlthough ammonia is a listed toxic substance, it is also a ubiquitous material, which is used by the surrounding farmers for fertilizer. Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.125\u00a0Exemptions \u00bf Ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient, when held by farmers, is exempt from all provisions of this part (40 CFR 68).\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nThe Home Run Inn facility has not had an accidental anhydrous ammonia release, which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacility Identification and Process Description\r\nThe Home Run Inn facility is located at 1300 Internationale Parkway, Woodridge, Illinois 60"
