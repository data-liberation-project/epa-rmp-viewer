Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident protection and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs. Enable Midstream's mitigation efforts include:  personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes.  Enable Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream's emergency response procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\r\n\t\r\n\tDESCRIPTION OF THE WETUMKA GAS PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Wetumka Gas Plant, located approximately 6 miles south and 4 miles east of Wetumka in Hughes County, Oklahoma, operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration assist to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  The plant products include pipeline quality natural gas - primarily methane - and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Wetumka Gas Plant which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\u00bf\tV-401 E/P Surge Tank -- Ethane\r\n\t\r\n\tThis vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a regulated flammable substance that could hypothetically be released and have offsite consequences.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn order"

Under Program Level 1 guidelines, the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release a regulated flammable mixture at Wetumka Gas Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the one of the largest storage tanks containing ethane. Under this WCS, 18,699 pounds of ethane is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.14 miles or 260 yards.  Additionally, although there are numerous controls and procedures in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS for the Wetumka Natural Gas Processing Plant.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\t\r\n\tThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Wetumka Gas Plant. The processes at the gas plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\t\r\n\tEmployee Participation\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Wetumka Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention."

In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Wetumka Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
