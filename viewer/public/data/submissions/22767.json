      "SummaryText": "Algona'  has a release prevention and emergency response policy at our facility.  This facility complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  This facility is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.   If any emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Gerald Zwiefel who is employed by West Bend Elevator.  Gerald will then decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed which is137,700 pounds.  This would cause the anhydrous to become liquefied under pressure.  If this were to occur the release rate would be 13,770 pounds per minute and duration of the release would be approximately 10 minutes.   According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles. There are an estimated 7,000 people within this radius.  Schools, residences, hospitals, prison/correction facilities, recreation areas, and major commercial, office or industrial areas are in this area.  Algona has 1 bullet tank and 34 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia at their location.  It is this facility's intention to comply with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  West Bend Elevator holds training sessions regularly to train new employees and review procedures with other employees.  Hoses, valves, and vents are inspected on a regular basis for any problems.  The anhydrous ammonia plant was designed, installed, and is maintained with state laws and regulations in mind.   We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Algona Fire Dept and request"
