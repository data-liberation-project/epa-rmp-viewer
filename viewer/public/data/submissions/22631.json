Krummrich Plant is the second oldest of the U.S. Solutia Plants, with ~400 employees.  In 1917, as part of Monsanto, the site was purchased from the Commercial Acids Company, which had started the plant in 1907 to manufacture sulfuric, muriatic, and nitric acids.  Today the plant occupies 311 acres and manufactures a variety of chemical intermediates which include chlorobenzenes, phosphorous pentasulfide, rubber antidegredents, and swimming pool chlorinating agents.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n     \nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is shipped in tank t"

The following\nare brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key \nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances \nfor each scenario:\n     \nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n \nThe scenario selected at the W.G. Krummrich plant involves Nitric Acid.  The largest storage tank of Nitric Acid holds a maximum of 375,000 pounds and would assume the entire contents of the tank is released to the environment in 10 minutes.  No administrative controls or mitigation controls are assumed for this worst-case scenario.  The resultant plume would have offsite consequences into the greater St. Louis metropolitan area.\n    \nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nChlorine: Three alternative release scenarios were developed for chlorine, all three involve small leaks on the 90 ton rail cars.  One scenario is a small leak developing on the rail car relief valve and the other two scenarios involve identical leaks on the rail car unloading valve; the difference being the location of the department, using the rail car, on the site.  In all three cases, the leak would yield a slight off-site consequence and would be mitigated by the site\u00bfs Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  One alternative release scenario was developed for anhydrous ammonia involving a vent line failure on the top of the 56,000 pound above-ground storage tank.

This leak would yield a slight off-site consequence. \n\nAqueous Ammonia:  Two alternative release scenarios were developed for aqueous ammonia, one in each of the departments that store the chemical.  One scenario involves the inadvertent emptying of a small, 2000 gallon, hold tank during a transfer operation.  The other scenario involves a leak on the bottom of a small storage tank, which would be mitigated by the site\u00bfs Hazardous Materials Response Team.  Either scenario would yield a slight off-site consequence.\n\nNitric Acid:  Two alternative release scenarios were developed for Nitric Acid, one within the department and one involving a rail car being held for use.  The scenario within the department involves a failure of a transfer pipeline and the subsequent shutdown and isolation of the pipeline.  The rail car scenario would involve a small leak developing on the bottom of the rail car and mitigation by the site\u00bfs Hazardous Materials Response Team.  Both scenarios yield an off-site consequence that would impact the immediate area surrounding the plant.\n \nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan\nand the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency \ncases.\n\n     \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n     \nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of \nhazardous chemicals.
