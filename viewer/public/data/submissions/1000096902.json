The site is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources invested to prevent accidents.  In addition to ensuring that employees have the best training in the operation of processes, safety must be the first priority in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.\r\n\r\nMaintenance and inspection programs help ensure site integrity.  Site policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Examples of controls to prevent releases include (1) installation of pressure relief valves to prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, (2) routine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good condition, (3) using materials of construction that are compatible with the process chemistry, (4) continuous monitoring of vessel pressure and temperature, and (5) use of carbon and water scrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions. Should a release occur, however, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation measures that have been included in design include installation of isolation valves, fire suppression systems in areas where flammable chemicals are present and fire fighting equipment in all process areas, a fully implemented emergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an alarm system for early notification of a release. The local fire department and hazmat team are also familiar with the Columbus site.  The plant manages site security using a guarded gate during standard business hours.   The site is completely fenced and the gates are kept closed except to allow controlled entry at all hours.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Kemira Chemicals, Inc Co"

      "SummaryText": "lumbus Plant manufactures primarily polyamines, polyamides, and polyacrylamides.  Raw materials are received via rail cars, tank trucks, tote bins, and drums and as a part of the manufacturing processes, the site uses some substances that are covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  The plant utilizes a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  Following is a brief description of the facility and the RMP regulated chemicals at the site.  The Columbus plant is situated on an 18 acre site.  Adjacent to the plant are an 8 acre property containing a storage building and spare equipment and a 4 acre vacant lot. The site has four covered chemicals and is subject to RMP Program Level 3.\r\n\r\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\r\nEPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that companies provide information about two types of offsite consequence analysis scenarios: worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. There are strict requirements for choosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a result, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative and represent a situation that is quite unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to provide emergency planners with more information about the chemicals handled at a site and their relative hazards. Alternative release scenarios are generally more realistic than worst-case scenarios.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe Columbus site takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals. The site management system addresses each of the key features of a successful\r\nprevention program, as described in the sections below.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nThe Kem"

      "SummaryText": "he Kemira Chemicals, Inc. Columbus plant maintains a written emergency response plan that is designed to protect employees, the public, and the environment. The procedures include all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and other medical procedures, the use of emergency equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, evacuation plans and community emergency response notification procedures.  Procedures for maintaining emergency response equipment are also contained in the emergency response plan. There are procedures that address maintaining, inspecting, testing and using the critical equipment needed in an emergency.  Employees receive periodic training in the duties they are expected to perform during an emergency and any change in the emergency response plan is administered through the management of change process so that affected employees are notified.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with local emergency responders (e.g., the fire department).  This includes periodic meetings with community responders so that they are aware of the hazards of our processes.  Communication channels with local responders are kept open 24 hours per day. This coordination and communication ensures that the public is quickly notified, if necessary, and that action is promptly taken to minimize the consequences of a release. We periodically conduct emergency response drills so that all participants are\r\nfamiliar with their duties during an emergency.  \r\n\r\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Columbus plant continuously strives to improve the safety of our processes.  Suggestions for improving safety are regularly identified and addressed through process hazard analyses, management of change procedures, incident investigations, and employee suggestions."

      "SummaryText": "ira Chemicals, Inc. Columbus Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at the facility. These documents are kept up to date, are available to all employees, and address important process parameters such as: (1) operating limits for the equipment, (2) design basis and configuration of the\r\nequipment and (3) physical properties and hazards associated with each chemical.  Chemical information is documented within Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's). MSDS's contain\r\ninformation concerning both the physical properties and the hazards associated with each chemical. This information typically includes (1) toxicity information, (2) physical\r\ndata, (3) reactivity and corrosivity data, (4) thermal and chemical stability data and (5) hazards of mixing substances together. MSDS's are available to all employees as well as\r\ncommunity emergency responders.  MSDS's for all Columbus materials are maintained on site.  Important process parameters are also documented and maintained. Engineering design documents may include (1) operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrumentation diagrams and (7) other information that is important for understanding the design intent, operating limits, and hazards of each process.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSES\r\nThe Columbus plant has a comprehensive program for ensuring that the hazards associated with site processes are identified and controlled. Each process is examined in detail to ensure that hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards.  A hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is completed as part of site process hazard analyses (PHA's).  A team comprised of personnel with engineering, operations, environmental and maintenance experience systematically examines each section of the process and\r\nidentifies potential"

The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.  \r\n\r\nPRESTART-UP SAFETY REVIEW\r\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, the Columbus plant performs a prestart-up safety review. This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is started or restarted.  A prestart-up safety review will generally include field verification of new construction and that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, the review will ensure that (1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, (2) adequate operating, safety and maintenance procedures are in place, (3) training for all affected employees is complete and (4) a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been performed, if necessary.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\nThe Columbus plant investigates each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in serious injury to employees, the public, or the environment.  Incident investigations are designed to determine the facts, identify root causes, and determine corrective actions to ensure that the incident does not recur.  Corrective actions resulting from an incident\r\ninvestigation are tracked until they are resolved.  \r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\nThe Columbus plant encourages employees to be involved in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees are routinely asked to participate in PHA's, incident investigations, management of change hazard Analyses, and all other aspects of the prevention program.

The various ways employees are involved in the prevention program are documented in a written plan.\r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\r\nThe Columbus plant has established safe work practices that ensure the safety of employees.  Examples include (1) hot work permits designed to control spark or flame producing activities, (2) a permit and procedure to control confined space entry, and (3) a lockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during maintenance. These procedures and permits ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\nThe Columbus plant uses contractors for various activities such as maintenance and construction.  All contractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well trained and able to perform their job function in a safe manner.  A contractor's safety record and performance are reviewed during the selection process. Once a contractor is selected, the plant provides training and procedures to ensure that contractor employees (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of the hazards associated with the area in which they will be working, (3) understand the emergency response procedures, and (4) report any hazards they find during their work. Site personnel periodically monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\nA compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively.  Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but is independent of our facility to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention. The results of audi"

The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making recommendations for further action when deemed necessary. These recommendations are resolved and prioritized by management and tracked until \r\nimplemented.  Update or revalidation of each PHA for regulated processes is completed every five years or whenever a significant change is made.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained.   \r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\nSite engineers, operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of the facility. These procedures cover all\r\nmodes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a\r\nnew or improved process. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing\r\nthe steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower operating limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable\r\nsafety and health information. Operating procedures are certified at least every three years as accurate to ensure that they are updated following process changes.  The Columbus plant also utilizes a batchsheet system. Batchsheets are the detailed manufacturing procedures for making a batch of product.  Batchsheets include process deviation codes describing the actions to take under various conditions (e.g., high temperature, high pressure, loss of cooling, etc) that may be encountered while manufacturing batches containing hazardous chemicals.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nThe Columbus plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks.

Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks. After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.  Through oral reviews, written tests and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them. Refresher training is performed at a minimum frequency of three (3) years. All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood. \r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\nThe Columbus plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails. When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem and try to identify the root cause(s) of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided. Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standard required for service in our facility. The mechanical integrity system includes (1) inspection and testing procedures, (2) replacement equipment specifications, (3) procedures for safe work practices, (4) maintenance personnel training and (5) required documentation. \r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\nWe review proposed changes to our processes to determine if new hazards are introduced or existing prevention measures are compromised by the change.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions. This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error.  In addition to the prevention program, the Columbus plant has safety features built into the design of the facility that help to ensure safe process operation for employees, the public, and the environment.  These features may contain or control a release, detect a release, or reduce the consequences of a release. They may also prevent a release by providing strict design standards for process equipment.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility:\r\n\r\nRelease detection\r\n- Procedures require that a plant employee be present during loading and unloading operations\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n- Automated notification systems for some process parameters, (e.g., high level, high pressure)\r\n- Manual shutdown systems located in the control room\r\n- Diked areas designed to contain a release and prevent its spread\r\n- Pressure relief valves and rupture disks that discharge safely to emissions control devices or the atmosphere\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n- Fire suppression equipment including dedicated fire monitors for the epichlorohydrin storage tank\r\n- Trained emergency response personnel\r\n- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)- protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus\r\n- Spill clean up equipment\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nSite incident and accident history is maintained for a minimum of five years.
