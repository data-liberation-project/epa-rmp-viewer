      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSouth Carolina Electric and Gas Company - Wateree Station\nEastover, South Carolina\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe South Carolina Electric and Gas Company (SCE&G) Wateree Station in Eastover, South Carolina, is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, contractors, the surrounding community, and the environment.  To meet this commitment, we have established systems to ensure safe operation of plant processes, which include the safe and proper handling of hazardous substances at the plant.  One component of these systems is a risk management program (RMP), which manages the risks involved with using hazardous substances.  Wateree Station's RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs.  This rule is also referred to as \"the RMP rule.\"  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan).  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide a description of the RMP at the Wateree Station.\n\nThe Wateree Station is the largest fossil plant in the SCE&G system.  The plant generates 700 megawatts of electricity by burning pulverized coal in two identical generation units.  Wateree Station's Unit 1 began commercial operation in 1970, and Unit 2 began operation in 1971.  To comply with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, SCE&G must reduce 85% of the total nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted systemwide by May 2004.  After exhaustive studies, SCE&G determined that Wateree Station would install a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reactor for each of Wateree Station's generating units.  Inside each SCR reactor, anhydrous ammonia is sprayed into the exit gas as it leaves the boiler.  Then the gas is processed through a series of ceramic plates (referred to as the catalyst), converting the NOx into nitrogen (an inert gas"

      "SummaryText": ") and water vapor.  Design engineering indicated the need to install two 60,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks to support operation of the SCR reactors.  Operation of the SCR reactors will be during the \"ozone season,\" which is from May 1 through September 30 of each year.\n\nThe Wateree Station RMP consists of three elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to identify (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule (see Sections 3 and 5 of this executive summary)\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule (see Section 4 of this executive summary)\n\n3. An emergency response program to provide guidance to the plant for responding to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule (see Section 6 of this executive summary)\n\nAlthough the RMPlan helps ensure that Wateree Station's RMP-covered system is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the plant's overall safety program.  In fact, a comprehensive safety program exists that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidents.\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\nLIMITING THE USE OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED BY THE RMP RULE\n\nSCE&G performed a thorough evaluation before selecting a pollution control technology that uses a hazardous substance regulated by the RMP rule (\"regulated substance\").  The potential for the hazardous substance to affect individuals and the environment has been considered, and SCE&G has taken the appropriate steps to address the hazards.\n\nPREVENTING RELEASES OF THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES USED\n\nWhen a regulated substance is used, the equipment that contains it is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Pertinent federal, state, corporate, and industry standards a"

      "SummaryText": "re strictly adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nLIMITING DAMAGE FROM A RELEASE, IF SUCH A RELEASE OCCURS\n\nSCE&G Wateree Station's main objective is to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from occurring.  In the unlikely event of a release, employees are trained to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release.  Coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Commissions (LEPCs) is an integral part of efforts to protect the health and safety of the surrounding community.  Emergency planning efforts have been performed with Richland County Emergency Services, and SCE&G will continue to work closely with them.  In addition, the LEPCs for the adjacent communities (Sumter County and Calhoun County) have been informed.  In short, actions have been taken to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of a release on our employees and the community.\n\nThe SCE&G safety program consists of a number of elements, many of which are beyond what is required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan executive summary is written to describe only those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule for Wateree Station.\n\n\nELEMENTS\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSCE&G is committed to the safety and protection of its employees and contractors, the public, and the environment.  All appropriate steps have been taken to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  These steps include (1) training programs for personnel, (2) programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes, and (3) programs to evaluate the hazards of our processes.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, SCE&G will be prepared to respond in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will minimize any injury to the public and the environment.

The planning efforts performed, in conjunction with Richland County Emergency Services/Columbia-Richland Fire Service, will help ensure proper coordination of emergency response personnel.\n\n\n2. REGULATED SUBSTANCE USED AT SCE&G'S WATEREE STATION\n\nThe Wateree Station has one substance (anhydrous ammonia) in sufficient quantity to be regulated by the RMP rule.  The anhydrous ammonia used at the plant is covered as a toxic material by the RMP rule.  As stated previously, anhydrous ammonia will be used as a reactant to reduce the emission of NOx from the plant.\n\n\n3. OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe RMP rule requires an offsite consequence analysis to be performed to estimate the potential for accidental releases (of anhydrous ammonia) that could affect individuals or the environment.  In accordance with this requirement, SCE&G evaluated one worst-case release scenario, as well as a more realistic (but still highly unlikely) alternative release scenario, for the anhydrous ammonia system connected to the SCR reactors.\n\nThe evaluated worst-case scenario is considered highly unlikely but was evaluated to estimate the maximum possible area that could be affected by a release of anhydrous ammonia from our plant.  Again, it is not a realistic scenario.  The more probable, but still highly unlikely alternative release scenario was analyzed for continual improvement in emergency preparedness and to inform the surrounding community's emergency response infrastructure.  Of the two scenarios, the alternative release scenario was selected to represent a plausible release scenario that could occur at Wateree Station.  The purpose of the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects on the public might occur as a result of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  For a release of a toxic material, the toxic endpoint is defined by EPA as the max"

The maximum inventory of approximately 51,000 gal (260,000 lb) of anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be released over a 10-minute period.  In this case, the predicted distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm) would reach offsite public receptors.\n\n3.2  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia process is a rupture of the tank truck unloading hose between the unloading pump and the anhydrous storage tank.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm) for this scenario would reach nearby offsite public receptors.  In evaluating this scenario, credit was taken for the reduction in release rate provided by the excess flow valves that are part of the engineering design for the anhydrous ammonia storage system.\n\n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSCE&G has developed a comprehensive prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) regulation.  For Wateree Station, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are also satisfied by this PSM program.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\n\n4.1  PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe accident prevention program for anhydrous ammonia consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n4.1.1 Process Safety Information\n\nA number of technical documents are maintained "

These documents address (1) physical properties of anhydrous ammonia, (2) operating parameters for the equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration for the equipment.  This process safety information is available to our employees and contractors.\n\n4.1.2 Process Hazard Analysis\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) of the anhydrous ammonia process was performed and will be periodically updated to identify process hazards, as well as to establish recommendations that will improve the safe operation of the RMP-covered process.  A multidisciplinary team was assembled to analyze the hazards of the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling process.  This team included personnel with engineering/process operating experience and a leader with experience in performing PHAs.  The team systematically addressed the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the anhydrous ammonia system and then prepared a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations was assigned to plant personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the system were implemented.  This analysis is revised at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n4.1.3 Operating Procedures \n\nWateree Station's engineers, operators, and the plant manager worked together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to ammonia system operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n* Steps for safely conducting activities\n* Applicable safety information, such as safety operating lim"

The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the system, (2) the properties and hazards of anhydrous ammonia, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures and safe work practices.  Classroom training and demonstrations are used to help impart knowledge to the employees.  Tests and demonstrations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can work on the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\n4.1.5 Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia handling equipment is maintained to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger employees and contractors, the public, or the environment. The mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage well before the equipment can fail and (2) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our process.\n\n4.1.6 Management of Change\n\nThe management of change (MOC) procedure is a written procedure that requires the review and approval of all proposed changes to the anhydrous ammonia system.  This includes chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the MOC procedure.  This helps to ensure that (1) inadvertent consequences of changes are prevented, (2) safety consequences of changes are addressed, (3) affected process safety information and procedures are"

This review confirms that:\n\n* Construction activities and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n* Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n* Employee training has been completed\n* For a covered process (\"regulated process\"), a PHA has been performed if the process is new, or MOC requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\n4.1.8 Compliance Audit\n\nOne of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment.  A program is in place to perform compliance audits of our RMP-covered process every 3 years to be certain the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the process.  These audits are performed by an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether (1) the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and (2) it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the ammonia system.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n4.1.9 Incident Investigation\n\nA program is in place to investigate any incidents or near misses that could reasonably result in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  The requirements to identify and report any incident requiring investigation are communicated to employees.  In the event of an incident, an investigation team would be assembled, and the investigation would be initiated as soon as possible, but always within 48 hours of the incident.

Employees are consulted and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program.\n\n4.1.11 Hot Work Permits\n\nA hot work permit program exists, which is intended to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions at Wateree Station.  This program conforms to OSHA requirements.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our new employee orientation.\n\n\n4.1.12 Contractors\n\nA program is in place to help ensure that contractor activities related to the RMP-covered ammonia system are performed in a safe manner.  Contractor supervisors are informed of the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures.  Contractors are required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees before he/she performs work at the plant.  Routine verification that this training has been provided is performed.\n\n\n4.2 CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, safety features specific to the anhydrous ammonia process have been implemented.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is delivered in tank trucks that must be approved by the Department of Transportation.
