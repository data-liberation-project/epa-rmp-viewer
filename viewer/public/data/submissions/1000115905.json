The NAICS code for the facility is 49312 \u0096 Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage. \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. \n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 62,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool the freezer system.\n\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\nIV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\nV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n \nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed throughout this document Bridge Point Northlake is continuously improving this program. \n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was conducted on January 10, 2020, and the next audit will occur before January 10, 2023, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years."
