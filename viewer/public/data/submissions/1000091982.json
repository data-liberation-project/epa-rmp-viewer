      "SummaryText": "COMPANY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\nThe facility formally known as Mozel Packaging began operating as EMCO Chemical Packaging (EMCO) in October 2019. EMCO is a wholesale chemical packager and distributor serving a number of U.S. industries.  We supply the automotive, coatings, ink, adhesives, sealants, plastics and  many other key industries with chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\n\n\nSome products stored and handled by EMCO are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n\n\n Prevention Program\n\n\n\nEMCO facilities that handle hazardous substances comply with stringent Operating Standards and Health, Safety & Environmental Employee Training Programs.  EMCO has documented the operating and safety procedures in the Quality Manual. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\n\n\nThe EMCO Columbia site stores, handles and delivers a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous chemical products to industrial and wholesale customers.  Formaldehyde solutions are handled at inventory levels above the RMP planning thresholds.  The typical inventory level for formaldehyde solutions is 150,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nGENERAL PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAs outlined previously, EMCO is subject to Program Level 3 prevention requirements under RMP.  Some of the chemical specific prevention steps at the Columbia site include the following:\n\n\n\n1.  The maintenance of minimal practical inventories.\n\n2.  Employee training and operating procedures.\n\n3.  Employee release detection and mitigation activities.\n\n4.  Equipment and containers designed to meet appropriate regulatory guidelines.\n\n5.  Inside storage in contained rooms equipped with sprinkler and foam fire suppression systems.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HIST"

      "SummaryText": "ORY\n\n\n\nThe Columbia site has experienced no accidents as specified in 40 CFR Part 68 related to the containerized storage or blending of formaldehyde in the previous 5 years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nEMCO has an Emergency Contingency Plan in-place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to EMCO facility personnel.  EMCO responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.  EMCO invites and encourages local emergency responders such as the fire department to visit and familiarize themselves with our products and facilities."
