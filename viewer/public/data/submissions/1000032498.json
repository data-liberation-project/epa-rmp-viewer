Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe management and employees of Crop Production Services at the Harlingen, TX facility are committed to the prevention of any release of chemicals handled at the facility.  If a release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with the local or state hazardous material team, the local fire department, the local or state administering agency, the tribal natural resource manager and our emergency response contractor to control, contain and clean up the release.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information (Stationary Source and regulated substance(s))\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at this facility is: a retail agriculture and chemical dealer that sales to the end user.\r\n\r\nThis facility stores and handles one regulated substance(s) Anhydrous Ammonia. It is also used at the facility for the production of Ammonium Polyphosphate (a non-regulated substance).\r\n\r\nAmmonium Polyphosphate is produced under contract by a third party company utilizing a portable reactor, and stored at the facility.  It is used as a fertilizer for direct field application by growers.\r\n\r\n3. Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative release scenario, however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by the US EPA.\r\n\r\n4.

Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis facility has prepared and implemented a written Emergency Plan that complies with state and federal regulations.  The Plan specifies the lines of authority, the roles and responsibilities individuals are to assume, and the specific actions to be taken and response limits for personnel during a release of a regulated substance.  The Plan includes procedures to follow for fires, explosions, medical emergencies, spills and releases and natural disasters such as earthquakes and flooding. It includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.  The Plan includes information on emergency healthcare and the name and telephone number of the local agency with which emergency response activities and the Plan are coordinated.\r\n \r\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Improvements to existing safety procedures and practices are determined through periodic inspections and audits."
