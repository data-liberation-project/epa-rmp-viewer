It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the local Fire Department ( a 911 call ) and request a response to the emergency. This call would also notify the Clayton County Sheriff's office.  A follow up call will be made to the office of the County LEPC.  A real emergency will be unexpected and may be very different in nature from any training in the past.  However, any previous planning/training will serve as guidelines to follow.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator is Randy Osmundson.  His work and 24 hr. Emergency  number is listed in the Registration Section of this document.  Additional contacts are listed below in order:\n\n    Randy Osmundson, President\n     Work: (563) 422-6281   24 hr.

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standards and State law.\n\nIn addition, the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nNorthern Ag Service, Inc., McGregor, IA, has not experienced accidental release involving anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that caused death, injuries, evacuations, property or environmental damage.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous  ammoia system, it is the policy of Northern Ag Service, Inc., to immediately contact the local Emergency Responders (fire dept., local police, county LEPC) with a 911 call.  Members of the local fire and police departments are encouraged to become familiar with our location and facilities, enabling them to more quickly asses any necessary response procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nOur overall plan is to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working with the anhydrous ammonia system make routine observations and inspections prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks, enabling them to detect problems early before they can cause a hazardous situation.  Empoyees are trained regularly to recognize areas of potential hazards and new hires are trained immediately and observed to determine their level of comprehension and understanding.  The company makes every effort to cooperate with local, state, and federal officials as they endeavor to assist us with our anhydrous ammonia operation."
