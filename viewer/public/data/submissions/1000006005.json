We coordinate our response efforts with the Grandin Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production. We have anhydrous ammonia stored in two inter-connected 30,000-gallon tanks, and twenty-two 1,000-gallon nurse at our facility in Grandin, North Dakota (Figure 1). The maximum amount stored at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 69,700 gallons (358,676.2 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks. The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 262,446 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nGrandin Coop Oil maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating p"
