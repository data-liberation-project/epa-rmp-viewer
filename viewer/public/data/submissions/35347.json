Headquartered in Mt. Sterling, Illinois, DOT is a family owned business that has grown from a single station wagon driven by the founder, Robert Tracy, to a fleet of over 400 multi-temp tractor trailers. This growth is in large part due to the customer driven attitude that is exhibited by all the members of the Dot team.  As stated on their website, \" Dot Foods will continue to be driven by the values of integrity, growth, profit, and customer satisfaction, with emphasis on innovation and employee welfare.\"\n\nDOT Foods' senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  DOT Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility who will respond to minor leaks.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe DOT Foods ammonia refrigeration system has been in operation since 1995.  Changes/modifications have taken place since the completion of the facility with an expansion in 1999.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 16301 Elliot Parkway, Williamsport, Maryland 21795.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 1"

The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the machine room roof, the water tank is located in the existing machine room, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DOT Foods facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room or on the machine room roof (condensers).\n\nAmmonia sensors are present in the machine room and cold storage areas.  The system shuts down if a concentration of 10,000 ppm is detected.  Since the renovation was completed in 1999, operators now have the ability to dial into the central computer and read the alarm from a portable computer.  \n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the DOT Foods - Williamsport facility's accident history as a part of the Hazard Assessment Update revealed that there have been no reportable ammonia related accidents, over the past five years (June 1999 - June 2004).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf an ammonia release were to occur, the DOT Foods response is to call the fire department's HazMat team to help aid in the shut down of the plant.  Now that the renovation is complete, operators hav"

The system shuts down if a concentration of 10,000 ppm is detected.  During off-hours the alarm is directed to an outside alarm company that informs the on-call operator.\n\nEmployees within the building are evacuated to a point upwind of the facility or shelter in place.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the facility's PSM/RMP program.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and is reviewed annually to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis provided the mitigation measures to improve safety at the DOT Foods facility located at 16301 Elliot Parkway, Williamsport, Maryland and were scheduled to be complete by June 2000.  DOT Foods' safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility's Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
