We treat approximately one million gallons of sewer a day. Chlorine is used to disinfect the effluent of the plant. Chlorine, while dangerous, is easily handled by quailified personnel. All of the people involved in handling, using and storing chlorine have been educated and will be continue to be educated in it's safe use. The plant consistently removes an average of 90% of the waste that enters the plant and discharges the treated water to Creosote Branch. Two full time operators, (State Certified), operate the plant during a five day week with a daily inspection taking place on the weekends. There has never been a reportable accident at the plant in the sixteen years it has been in operation.\n\nWe have compiled the safety information on the plant(as the law requires). This consists of all the specifications,codes and standards used in the materials and construction of the plant. Also all the information on the chlorine or any other chemical used in the treatment plant.\n\nWe have done a safety review of the safety procedures at the plant(as the law requires). The consist of a review of all the procedures to be used in case of an accident or spill of hazardous materials. Also the  policys and procedures that will be employed in the case of any type of emergency.\n\nWe have established operation procedures at the plant(as the law requires). These consist of a complete set of policys and procedures to be used in the operation and maintenance of all the equipment located at the treatment plant.\n\nWe have and continue to provide training at the plant(as the law requires). Louisiana Rural Water Association and Louisiana Conference on Water Supply, Sewerage, and Industrial Waste, Inc. schools for certification requirements(at least 40 hours per two years).\n\n"
