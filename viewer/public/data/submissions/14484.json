Gerber Legendary Blades Division has been in business since 1939 and manufactures sporting knives, sporting goods, and multi-purpose hand tools. \n\nFiskars Inc. is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all its employees. Our commitment and responsibilities are stated in our written safety and environmental compliance policy and program management procedure. Our program is based on management commitment and employee involvement, training for employees and management, worksite analysis and inspections, hazard prevention and exposure control methods, safety committee involvement, and behavior based safety training. Our written program procedures include Hazard Communications, Energy Control (LO/TO), Hearing Conservation, Emergency Response and Evacuation, Protection from Blood Born Pathogens, Safe Work Practices, Worksite Inspections, Accident Investigation, Mobile Equipment Operations, and Process Safety Management.\n\nFiskars Inc. is also dedicated to protecting the environment and those who work or live near the Gerber Legendary Blades Division plant. The plant is a conditionally exempt hazardous waste generator, and has been for more than a few years. Safeguards are taken to ensure all manufacturing processes are safe and meet environmental regulations before they are placed into production. Engineering, safety, production, and the plant safety committee review any new equipment or process before it is places into production using the \"Equipment/Safety Evaluation worksheet\". Any deficiencies found during the evaluation are promptly corrected.\n\nGerber Legendary Blades uses anhydrous ammonia as part of its heat treat process in order to increase the hardness of stainless steel knife blades, knife components and tool components. Ammonia enters one of two heat treat furnaces and is disassociated into nitrogen and hydrogen. All the ammonia is consumed in the heat treating process. \n\nAmmonia is stored in two horizon"

Both tanks are built to all applicable safety and ANSI standards.\n\nBoth furnaces have a myriad of safety features built into their controllers. Each furnace will immediately stop using ammonia because of too high or too low ammonia pressure.\n\nAn external ammonia alarm system also detects ammonia in the workspace by each heat treater. If ammonia is detected at 10 PPM or more, an alarm and yellow strobe light with illuminate on two alarm panels. If the system detects ammonia at 25 PPM, it will automatically close an emergency shut-off valve located outside the building as close to the tanks as practical.\n\nArrangements have been made with the local fire department, Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue, for emergency response if an ammonia leak did occur.\n"
