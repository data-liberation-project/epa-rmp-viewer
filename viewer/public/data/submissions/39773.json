This program continues the City of Monroe\u00bfs commitment to the protection of its employees and the control of the potential for such a release.  To date, no such release has occurred at the plant. The complete PSM program is summarized in Appendix A.  This summary was submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as required by Federal regulation.\n\n1.1 Program Summary\n\nThe program described herein supplements the procedures described in other City documents such as general administrative guidelines and safety and health manuals.  The PSM program addresses the City of Monroe\u00bfs program management procedures, process safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, employee training, safe work practices, contractor safety, and emergency response.  Each topic has its own chapter in this program document.  Most management elements of the program appear in Section 2 of this document.  Process safety information describing the hazards and physical properties of chlorine and ammonia, as well as safe operating limits and a description of the major process equipment is included in Section 3.\n\n1.2 Process Hazard Review\n\nA process hazard review was conducted for each regulated process.  The hazard review team consisted of plant management, process operating and maintenance experts, and outside process design engineers.  The hazard review team used a \"What-If\" technique.  The product of that review appears as Section 4 of this program document.\n\n1.3 Training \n\nThe City of Monroe has implemented a training program with regular and structured plant training in operations, maintenance, and safety for WTP employees.  Training record forms document the required training.  The training records for all"
