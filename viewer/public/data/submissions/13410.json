Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGeorgia Gulf Corporation, Plaquemine Facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to protect people, property and the environment.\n  \n2.        The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of Aromatic Chemicals, Electrochemicals and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Resins.  We have two regulated substances above the RMP threshold quantity present at our facility.  These substances are Chlorine, and Vinyl chloride monomer.  Chlorine and is used in the manufacture of vinyl chloride monomer.  Vinyl chloride is used for feedstock in the manufacture of PVC resin.\n \n 3.        The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including  administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported  scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of chlorine from its storage vessel (91% of the storage capacity is released).  The scenario involves a large release which creates a 1 cm pool from which evaporation takes place over a 10 minute period.  \nIn order for this worst case scenar"

In the unlikely event that every one of these conditions was to occur, the maximum distance to the EPA's toxic endpoint of .0087 mg/L or 3 ppm is greater than 25 miles.\n \nAlthough the EPA does not allow companies to consider any active safety measures when analyzing the worst case scenario, Georgia Gulf has a number of safety systems in place to prevent a release from ever occurring at the chlorine storage vessel.  The vessel meets strict design and construction standards.  It is constructed of 1 inch-thick steel and wrapped with a 1 = inch-thick layer of insulation to help control the temperature and pressure inside the vessel. To prevent the vessel from over pressuring and releasing, the vessel has two relief valves.  These relief valves are tested every two years.  An isolation valve is located on the discharge of the vessel to shut off flow if there is a rupture downstream of the valve.  Numerous instrument alarms are in place to warn of potential equipment malfunction, including multiple pump malfunction.   In addition, we have a facility-wide leak detection and repair program to identify and repair leaks before they could ever result in an emergency.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from a chlorine rail car unloading hose.  The scenario involves the release of 20000 lb. of chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The release is estimated to take place over a period of 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by Operator Intervention.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine is 6.2 miles.\n\nGeorgia Gulf has installed safet"

The  hoses used at Georgia Gulf exceed the design and construction requirements for our railcar unloading conditions.  Each unloading hose is inspected prior to each use, and the hose fittings are replaced whenever indications of visible wear are present.  There is a relief valve on every railcar to prevent the railcar and unloading hose from over pressuring.  We have instrument alarms to warn of potential equipment malfunction and equipment shutdowns to shut off flow.  Each station is monitored by an operator.  An automatic shutoff valve is located on each railcar to shut off flow if the unloading hose fails.  We have multiple remote block valves, check valves, and a control valve that can shut off flow to the railcar unloading line to isolate and limit any release.  An operator is located at all times within 100 feet of the railcars, which will ensure that the release can be manually isolated quickly.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of Vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  In this scenario 8500000 lb. of VCM is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 1.22 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi over pressure.\n\nGeorgia Gulf has a number of safety systems in place to prevent a release from ever occurring at the sphere.

Remote valves are installed to isolate and limit any release from the sphere.  In addition, we have a facility-wide leak detection and repair program to identify and repair leaks before they could ever result in an emergency.  This program includes scheduled monitoring of pumps, valves, connectors, and other equipment using portable hydrocarbon leak detectors.  When a leak is found, it is repaired and remonitored to verify that it is leak free.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release of VCM.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 38000 lb. of Vinyl chloride in 5 minutes.  The scenario involves a the mechanical failure of a pressure relief valve causing it to lift prior to reaching its set point.  The release duration is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include operator intervention.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi over pressure is 0.13 miles.  No offsite population or receptors are effected.  Georgia Gulf carries out maintenance checks on a regular basis to ensure proper operation of relief valves.
