The owner, management, and employees of Southwest Chemical & Fertilizer, Pipestone, Mn. are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia or Propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION.\nA. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and propane for sale to farmers and other customers.\nB. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application on crops as a fertilizer nutrient.\nC. Propane is received, stored, and distributed as LP-Gas to the end user.\nD. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 79000 pounds in a 18000 gallon storage tank, which represents 85% of the tank capacity, as limited by design standards.\nE. The maximum quantity of propane stored would be 100000 pounds in a 30000 gallon storage tank.\n\nIII. THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO'S FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 79000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would be .83 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario is based on a release from a break in a transfer hose. The quantity released would be 26000 pounds. The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would be .59 miles.\n\nIV. THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO'S FOR PROPANE.\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank. The maximum q"
