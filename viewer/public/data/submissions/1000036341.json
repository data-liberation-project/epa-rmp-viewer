This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain release.\n\n\n\nContinuous improvement in safety and environmental performance will be achieved, among other things, through the company's Employee Safety Process, Tenets of Operation, guiding principles, and RAPTOR (Revealing At Risk Potentials Through Observing and Reporting) Program. Planned changes to improve safety are reviewed and adjusted annually. They are also included in the yearly budgets; and incorporated into the performance management systems/practice throughout the organization. These planned changes include, but are not limited to, safety related capital projects, safety programs/initiatives, procedure improvements, and SOP validations.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex consists of eight operating units linked by multiple pipelines. The complex, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of State Highway 35 and FM 524, about 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston. The complex also operates a terminal and storage facility, along with the pipelines that connect this facility to the main plant and its markets. The plant produces simple olefins, including ethylene and propylene, some C6 products, butadiene, and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL). These products are primarily intermediates which our customers use to produ"

Because processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSweeny Complex management encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Sweeny Complex's Accidental Release Prevention Program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the Accidental Release Prevention Program are documented in the Employee Participation Element of the Sweeny Complex Process Safety Management System. In addition, Sweeny Complex has a number of teams to promote both process safety and personal safety. The teams typically involve members from various areas of the plant, including operations"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information. Process Safety Information reference documents are readily available as part of the written Employee Participation Plan to help employees locate any necessary Process Safety Information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the complex has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit-specific Process Safety Information (PSI) document. The teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nSweeny Complex also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm the safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard "

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nSweeny Complex primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The team employs a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to assist with this task.\n\n\n\nThe PHA Team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA Team (using LOPA). This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo confirm that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design features Sweeny Complex periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperati"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Sweeny Complex maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny Complex has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. Training for process operators is managed by the plant Training Department and includes rigorous initial hire or job transfer training with classroom and on-the-job elements. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.
