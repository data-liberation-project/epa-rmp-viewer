Plant #1 is located 1220 North 2nd st. in Leavenworth, KS.and Plant #2 is located at 982 North highway 5 in Lansing KS.\n\nPlant #1 has 8000 pounds of Chlorine capacity at any given time. These are in 2000 pound cyclinders with only one cyclinder being in process at a time with a back-up cyclinder.\n\nPlant #2 has 8000 pounds of Chlorine capacity at any given time. These are in 2000 pound cyclinders with only one cyclinder being in process at a time with a back-up cyclinder.\n\nOur worst case scenario would be a release of 8000 pounds of Chlorine at Plant # 1 or 8000 pounds of Chlorine at Plant # 2 from a result of an unknown catastrophy or fire within the facilities. If this would be the case we would activate our emergancy response plan that would notify the Fire Department of city of Leavenworth. They in turn would resond to the facility and contain the release and help with the evacuation of the residences and businesses within the end point of each facility\n\nPlant manager would notify Waste Express of Kansas City Missouri  to respond to the plant to mitigate the release.\n\nHowever, our most likely type of release would consist of <2,000 pounds of Chlorine. This would be the result of equipment failure. Again the Fire Department and Waste Express of Kansas City Missouri  would be notified to mitigate release.\n\nWe here at Leavenworth Water Works train our personnel annually to the level of being First Responders Operational Level in accourdance with 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\nWe also reveiew our emergency, saftey and health programs annually to update and train our employees.\n\nWithin the past (5) years, the Leavenworth Water Works has never had or reported a release of Chlorine within the operations of the facilities.\n\nLeavenworth Water Works, is always looking for new information and training available"
