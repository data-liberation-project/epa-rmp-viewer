The local coordinating agencies have been provided with a copy of the report, and agreements have been reached with local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nResponse Procedures\r\nResponse Procedures are dictated by the magnitude of the release. For planning purposes three magnitudes of release are considered:\r\n\r\nSmall Release:\r\nSmall leak such as from a rust hole, faulty valve, leaking gasket, packing nut leak, etc.\r\nLeak containable within the building area.\r\nFacility-wide evacuation not needed.\r\nLeak can be controlled and managed by plant personnel without outside help.\r\n\r\nMedium Release:\r\nA medium leak such as from a broken valve housing or blown pressure gauge, etc.\r\nLeak containable within facility boundaries.\r\nRequires evacuation of entire facility.\r\nLeak controllable by plant personnel, but may require outside assistance, traffic control, and limited evacuation.\r\n\r\nLarge Release:\r\nA large leak such as from a ruptured cylinder.\r\nRelease extends beyond facility boundaries.\r\nRequires facility and community evacuation and in-place sheltering.\r\nWill require the assistance of fire, police, ambulance, hospital, and other local emergency services.\r\n\r\nResponse Actions for Small Release Scenario\r\nAs soon as a chlorine gas leak is detected, the employee who notices the leak must notify the plant operator and emergency coordinator of the leak. If the employee is trained in controlling chlorine or sulfur dioxide leaks, and the leak is minor and appears controllable, he or she should act immediately to rectify the situation.  In no event must the employee act in a manner that will endanger his or her safety.  If the leak appears serious enough that one person cannot control the situation, the employee must not act alone.  The employee must summon help and in the meantime gather the tools/equipment needed to control the leak.  After th"

Regulatory agencies may not be notified in the event of a small leak. However, authorities at the City of Calhoun including the director of Public Works should be notified irrespective of the magnitude of the release.\r\n\r\nResponse Actions of Medium Release Scenario\r\nA determination that a release is medium rather than small is a judgment call made by the employee detecting the leak based on a visual evaluation of the situation.  The employee who noticed the leak should immediately notify the plant operator and emergency coordinator of the leak and alert them that the release appears to be medium. If the employee is trained in the control of gas leaks he or she must wear a SCBA and wait upwind of the source for the plant operator and emergency coordinator to arrive at the scene.  The plant operator must evacuate the facility of all employees except those who will participate in leak control efforts.  The plant operator must also immediately alert the local emergency response agencies that their assistance may be needed in the areas of community evacuation and medical help, if the leak gets worse.  After arriving at the scene, the plant operator and the emergency coordinator must wear SCBA units and begin leak control efforts. Control of the leak should be the first priority for the employees. Authorities at the City of Calhoun including the director of Public Works will be notified of the release. Regulatory agencies will be notified following the discussion with the Authority personnel.\r\n\r\nResponse Actions of Large Release Scenario\r\nResponse actions for a large release are similar to a medium-scale release.  However, in this scenario, the accident is so major (such as a ruptured cylinder) that the bulk of the response efforts are tailored toward post-release mitigation, community evacuation a"

The program includes a hazard assessment that evaluates both a worst-case scenario and an alternative scenario, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. This document serves a vital community right to know function by informing the public of potential risks associated with the releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and described the CityA\u00bfs efforts to minimize such risks.\r\n\r\nREGULATORY BACKGROUND\r\nSection 112(r) of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act required certain facilities to take steps to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued A\u00bfChemical Accident Prevention Provision,A\u00bf rules (contained in 40 CFR Part 68) to implement the 112(r) requirements. Under this rule, all covered facilities must implement a risk management program and file a risk management plan with the EPA by June 21, 1999. A covered facility would be one that uses, stores, manufactures, handles, or moves any of the 140 chemicals listed in 40 CFR Part 68 at quantities exceeding the threshold levels as provided in the regulations.\r\n\r\nFACILITY INFORMATION\r\nThe City of Calhoun wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is a covered facility because of the usage and storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are both regulated substances, and the respective threshold quantities are 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds under the regulations. The chlorination facilities at the Calhoun WWTP consist of eight 1-ton cylinders of chlorine (po"

Since the storage quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide both exceed threshold, Calhoun WWTP is a covered facility under the Risk Management Plan rules.\r\n\r\nThe City of Calhoun owns and operates a 16 million gallon per day (MGD) WWTP in Calhoun, Georgia. The WWTP provides sewage treatment to the local residential population and the numerous industries that are located in the City. The WWTP is a biological activated sludge treatment system with carousel and fine air diffusers aeration basins. Sludge stabilization is provided by aerobic digesters, and the City disposes of the sludge by land application. Effluent disposal is into the Oostanaula River. Prior to discharge, the treated effluent is disinfected using chlorine and dechlorinated using sulfur dioxide to prevent the formation of chlorinated byproducts. The RMP focuses on the chlorination and dechlorination facilities at Calhoun WWTP. Based on the quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored at the Calhoun WWTP, it is very likely that there will be off-site consequences for public receptors in the event of a worst-case release, and therefore Calhoun WWTP will not qualify as a Program 1 facility. Since Georgia is a federal OSHA state (i.e., Georgia has not been delegated OSHA responsibilities), state and local governments within Georgia are not subject to OSHA PSM standards, and therefore Calhoun WWTP will not be a Program 3 facility. Thus, Calhoun WWTP will be classified as a Program 2 facility.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nProgram Elements\r\nThe City of Calhoun has developed an emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.\r\n\r\nCoordinating Agencies\r\nThe emergency response plan will be coordinated annually with the City of Calhoun and Gordon County police and fire departments and the Calhoun and Gordon County Lo"

Any residents living in the zone of influence should be temporarily evacuated to an area of safety until such a time that the release gets controlled and the leaking gases are dispersed.  Traffic control on roads downwind of the release will be necessary to prevent persons from entering the gas release zone.\r\nImmediate medical assistance should be provided to facility employees and community members requiring assistance.  Providing medical assistance will require the support of ambulance service, paramedics, doctors, and local hospitals.\r\n\r\nRelease notification is of two types: verbal and written.  When making a verbal notification immediately after the release incident, the following information should be provided to the EPCRA hotline at 1-800-535-0202:\r\n\r\nName of caller\r\nName of facility\r\nLocation information\r\nChemical released (Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide)\r\nDate, time and duration of release\r\nRelease quantity estimate\r\nRemedial measures undertaken\r\n\r\nThe verbal notification must be followed by a written notice within 24 hours after the emergency situation is controlled.  A release notification form prepared for City of Calhoun's facilities is presented in the Appendix.  The release notification form provides the following information pertaining to the release:\r\n\r\nFacility information\r\nEstimate and quantity of release\r\nDate, time and duration of release\r\nMedia into which the release occurred\r\nMedical information regarding chlorine\r\nEvacuation plans\r\nContact information\r\nCommunication with the Public\r\n\r\nInternal and external communications are critical during an emergency.
