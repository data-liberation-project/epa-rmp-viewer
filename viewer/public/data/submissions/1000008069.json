Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we re-package silane, supplied from bulk storage (isomodules), into smaller compressed gas containers.   Silane, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAA?s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the Hazardous Materials unit from Renewable Energy Corporation (REC) Silicon, an adjoining manufacturing facility, and the local fire authority so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAA?s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the transfill of silane from a bulk supply to smaller containers.  DOT cylinders (44-liter, 49-liter, or 448-liter) are pressure filled by cascading directly from an ISO module by the operator while the ISO contains enough pressure.  When ISO pressure is not sufficient, the silane gas pressure is regulate"

The maximum amount of this substances inventoried at this facility is 38,700 pounds.\n\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThis facility came on line in November of 1996.  In the last five years, there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of silane that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nAll facility employees have been trained to OSHAA?s HAZWOPER, First Responder Awareness Level, in order to identify the need for an initiated emergency response.  Retraining is conducted annually.\n\nThe facility maintains an Site Emergency Action Plan that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release. This information also contains the names and numbers of responding outside agencies.  Emergency actions and response for flammable releases have been coordinated with REC and Grant County Fire Distrtict #5.  Training is provided annually to employees on the Site Emergency Plan.  \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHA's and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
