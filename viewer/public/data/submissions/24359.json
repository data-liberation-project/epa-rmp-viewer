Harcros Organics has demonstrated this commitment through a system of  \nmanagement practices which help to ensure safe operations at this facility.  The Risk Management \nProgram is a part of our system which helps us manage risks at Harcros Organics.  The requirements of the Risk Management Program can be found in the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR Part 68,  Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Program (the RMP rule).  It is the intention of this executive summary to provide the public with a description of Harcros Organic's Risk Management and to satisfy Risk Management Plan requirements of the Risk Management Plan rule.\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\nAt this facility, we handle ethylene oxide and propylene oxide which are hazardous substances.  The same properties that make ethylene oxide and propylene oxide valuable as commodity \nchemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our  health  and to reduce the threat to nearby members \nof the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.  Harcros Organics implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  We will determine for each situation whether evacuation of employees is required.  We have an Emergency Response Plan for spills.  We will rely on public and private agencies to supplement our own response personnel.  The public agencies will notify any"

The chemicals are transferred to reactors where they are consumed in the process to make less hazardous products.  The ethoxylation and propoxylation unit produce surfactants which are used in detergents, emulsifiers, hard surface cleaners, plastics, personal care products and agricultural applications.\n\nThis facility has controlled access at all times.\n\n\n4.0 The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and with all applicable State codes and regulations.  The processes which use ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are not only subject to the Risk Management Plan Rule but also subject to the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.   This standard \naddresses each of the OSHA (PSM) elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nHarcros Organics encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Employee participation ranges from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Information created as part of our plant accident prevention program is available to all employees.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHarcros Organics maintains a variety of technical documents and information concerning process chemicals and process equipment which is essential to an effective process safety management program and to process hazard analysis.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemicals specific information, i"

Harcros Organics ensures that the process is maintained within limits using process controls, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nHarcros Organics has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with ethylene oxide and propylene oxide processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is \nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  We have used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis method to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique.  The process hazard analysis for the processes are carried \nout by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The HAZOP team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and makes recommendations which are addressed.  All approved mitigation options which are being implemented in response to HAZOP team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nAt least every 5 years, the process hazard analysis is updated and revalidated.  This assures the process hazard analysis is consistent with the current process.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWritten procedures are maintained that address various modes of process operations such as unit start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shut down, normal shut down and \ninitial start up of a new process.  Procedures are reviewed periodically and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\nTraining\nEach employee  involved with operating a process and each employee before being involved in operating a newly assigned process is trained in an overview of the process and in the standard operating procedures.

After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.\n\nRefresher training is provided at least every three years.   All training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nHarcros Organics has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their working in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in the work place , (4) understand what they should do in an emergency, (5) understand site safety rules, including notifying Harcros Organics personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.   This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements and safe work practices prior to  beginning work.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nA pre-startup safety review is done for new or modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHarcros Organics has practices and written procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, emergency shutdown systems in safe operating conditions.\nMaintenance employees involved in maintaining the on going integrity of process equipment are provided an overview of the process and its hazards and in the procedure applicable to the employees job tasks to assure that the employee can perform the job task in a safe manner.\n\nSafe Work Practice\nHarcros Organics has  long standing safe work practices in place"

These procedures along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities  are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nHarcros Organics has  procedures to manage change (except for \"replacement in kind\") of process chemicals, technology, equipment, and operating procedures  that affect covered processes.\n\nIncident Investigation\nHarcros Organics investigates each incident which resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of a highly hazardous chemical in the work place.  Incident investigations are initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop correction actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team consist of at least one person knowledgeable in the process and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A management committee is established to properly address and resolve incident report findings and recommendations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.
