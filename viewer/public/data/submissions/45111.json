As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Horizon Ethanol, LLC. completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nHorizon Ethanol, LLC. is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Horizon Ethanol, LLC. to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Horizon Ethanol, LLC. to notify the Jewell Fire Department and Hamilton County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 804,546 pounds (total pentane is 321,818 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and does not contain any regulated constit"

Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nHorizon Ethanol, LLC. is a new facility and does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.  This facility anticipates start up of grinding operations on March 13, 2006 and distillation operations the week of March 20, 2006."
