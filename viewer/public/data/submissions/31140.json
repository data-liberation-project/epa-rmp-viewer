This RMP is for facility 1000 0002 4065, the largest of the Water Treatment Plants (WTP) owned and operated by Frederick County Division of Utilities & Solid Waste Management.\n\nThis facility treats about three (3) mgd from the Potomac River and serves 18228 residential Customers (6751 residential accounts) and 491 commercial/industrial accounts.  Twenty-four thousand pounds of Chlorine is the maximum amount of chemical stored at this facility at any given time.  There are no other hazardous chemicals used or stored at or above reportable quantities at this facility.  There has never been a release of Chlorine at this facility that has escaped off-site.  This is one of two (2) Division facilities required to submit RMP data; therefore, much of the data contained in this report is similar or the same for both facilities.\n\nOn a routine basis Frederick County\u00bfs insurance carriers make site inspections of major Division facilities including the New Design Road WTP.  These inspections include review of policies, procedures, training programs, environmental permits, contingency plans, and Tier II inventories.  Frederick County has had two (2) RMP audits, one in 2002 and another in 2004.\n\n\nSECTIONS II & III\n\nBoth release scenarios used in this report use a single ton container.  With policies and procedures in place as well as the safety record of this facility, it is believed that this is the largest amount of chlorine that would be released in a single incident.\n\nThe first scenario was a Chlorine gas release that takes place over a 10 minute period of time.  This time frame is the estimated time that it would take for sensors to activate and alarm, personnel to r"

This time frame is based on the size of the fusible plug and the emptying of the entire container.\n\n\nSECTION IV & V\n\nFrederick County Division of Utilities & Solid Waste Management does not use or store flammable chemicals/materials subject to RMP requirements; therefore no other scenarios are submitted.\n\n\nSECTION VI\n\nThe New Design Road WTP has an excellent safety record.  Having had no accidental releases in its history of now greater than 35 years, there is nothing to report.\n\n\nSECTION VII & VIII\n\nWhat-if & What-if/Checklists were used to update the PHA for this facility.  Review of the facility specific SOPs and Division policies and procedures are conducted annually.\n\nBecause of the critical nature of water supply, Frederick County DUSWM has built redundancy into many of its most critical processes.  This redundancy includes dual power and generators for power failures, duplicate pumps, controls, and sensors for other equipment.  Audible and visual alarms and procedures are in place for routine and emergency process control.  Automatic controls and shutoffs are equipped with manual backups in the event of power failures or other emergencies that may cause equipment control failure.\n\nThis facility has a Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) at the main gate to the facility.  This gate is electrically operated with either card key access or manual operation in the facility\u00bfs administration building when the call box is activated.  Chlorine containers are stored in a building which is separate from the administration and laboratory building.  The Chlorine building is not ventilated to the outside atmosphere and is equipped with a chlorine scrubber system.  Chlorine detectors are stationed at critical areas and connected to audible and"

This system is tested routinely in accordance with established protocols.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOP) are continually reviewed and revised as necessary.   All policies and procedures are reviewed annually as well as for this RMP.  Frederick County DUSWM has an extensive Occupational Health & Safety Program.  This program has set the benchmark for many other safety committees/programs within other Frederick County Divisions and Departments.  Policies and plans are in place and training for all employees takes place throughout the year.  Currently theses plans/policies or training include the following:\n\nPPE (Personal Protective Equipment)\nHazard Communication (RTK)\nEmergency Action & Fire Prevention & Extinguisher Use\nChlorine Safety/Chlorine Repair Kit \u00bfA & B\u00bf\nEmergency Response to Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Releases\nBloodborne Pathogens, First Aid & CPR\nAtmospheric Testing & Respiratory Protection\nConfined Space Entry\nSafe Lifting\nFork Lift Safety\nDefensive Driving\n\nReview of all policies is ongoing throughout the year.  Formal reviews are conducted on an annual basis.  Formal reviews were conducted for this RMP Submission.  An on-the-job training (OJT) program has been implemented using both job performance checklists as well as health & safety training for performance evaluation.\n\nContractors hired to work on major projects must demonstrate that their personnel are competent to work in Confined Spaces, have Atmospheric Testing Equipment and knowledge, have appropriate Respiratory Protection and comply with other County and Division safety policies.\n\nThe DUSWM has an active Safety Committee.  This committee inspects DUSWM facilities on a periodic basis and also assists in policy review.\n\nThe DUSWM has implemented a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for tracking equipment, repairs (emergency as well as routine), preventative maintenance tasks, and resources (man-hours, parts, and equipment).\n\n\nSECTION IX\n\nThe DUSWM is a Fr"
