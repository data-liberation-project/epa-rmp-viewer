The facility is owned and operated by Inergy, LP.  Facility operations are covered by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (Cal OSHA) regulations in Title 8, California Code of Regulations (CCR), ?5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials (PSM).  The facility is also subject to the Office of Emergency Service's regulations in Title 19 CCR,  ?2735, California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  This is a Federal Risk Management Program (RMP) and CalARP Program Level 3 process.\n\n\n\nInergy installed the Aqueous Ammonia System at the North Coles Levee Facility in July 2005.  The Aqueous Ammonia System is regulated by Title 19 California Code of Regulations ?2755, CalARP Program.  This is a CalARP Level 2 process.  The prevention program described below has been implemented.\n\n\n\nInergy installed the Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System at the North Coles Levee Facility in 2008.  The Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System is regulated by Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2755 CalARP Program.  This is a Cal ARP Level 2 process.  The prevention program described below has been implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe facility processes, stores, and transfers natural gas, natural gasoline, propane, and butane.  There are 32 tanks with capacities ranging from 4,000 to 44,000 gallons, two tanks with a capacity of 1.3 million gallons, one tank with a capacity of 5 million gallons, and one 15 million gallon storage tank. The worst-case flammable scenario is based upon a release of 15 million gallons of butane.\n\n\n\nThe North Coles Levee Fractionator operates 24 hours per day receiving natural gas from"

The remaining natural gas is sold to Public Utility Commission (PUC) regulated utility companies for home use.  NGL's are fractionated into propane, butane, iso-butane, normal butane, and gasoline components for a multitude of industry uses.  This facility has the ability to remove hydrogen sulfide that may be present in incoming liquid deliveries.  In the summer, the facility receives and stores liquid propane to be used as winter fuel in refrigerated storage tanks.\n\n\n\nDuring 2008, Inergy started construction of a new butane isomerization (butamer) unit at the North Coles Levee Facility for which this updated RMP is being submitted. The butamer converts normal butane (n-butane) into iso-butane. The conversion of n-butane to iso-butane is accomplished catalytically in the presence of hydrogen.  \n\n\n\nInergy currently operates a cogeneration unit and is planning to install a new cogeneration unit, both of which utilize a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) System and oxidation catalyst to reduce oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas.  The system utilizes aqueous ammonia, which is mixed in dilution air in a vaporizer tower, vaporized, and directed to the reactor where it is injected upstream of the catalyst bed.  \n\n\n\nInergy also utilizes a refrigeration system for the treatment and/or storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids, which contains approximately 950 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant.   \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is based on the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulation, Part 68, and Title 19 CCR ?2735 and ?2755.  The program includes the following elements: Offsite Consequence Analysis, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, C"

An earthquake is a possible external event at the facility.   This facility resides outside the boundaries and contours of a Near-Source Fault Zone according to the document \"Maps of Known Active Fault Near-Source Zones in California and Adjacent Portions of Nevada,\" published by the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO).\n\n\n\nIn May 1999 an external events analysis consisting of a preliminary seismic walkthrough was conducted.

The 911 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nInergy maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The North Coles Levee Facility has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department, the Certified Unified Program Agency for Kern County.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in Title 19 CCR ?2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release.  This information was verified by the reviewing of records from the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department. \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety have been established based on process safety management audits and the process hazard analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nTwo worst-case scenarios were modeled based on the materials being utilized and the process program levels (2 and 3):\n\n\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario used aqueous ammonia as the modeled substance.  The worst-case release of 37,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 1.4 miles.  This distance does not impact any public receptors.  The passive mitigation considered for this analysis includes enclosures and berms.  This scenario is based upon the RMP Comp Version 1.07 software."

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nThe flammables worst-case scenario used butane as the modeled substance.  The worst-case release of 73,000,000 pounds of butane indicates a 1 psi overpressure endpoint distance of 3.36 miles.  Based on LandView 6 Population Estimator, this distance impacts public receptors in the form of 81 housing units and 239 residents.  This scenario uses EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations model C-2, \"Equations for Estimation of Distance to 1 psi Overpressure for Vapor Cloud Explosions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThree alternate release scenarios were modeled based on the materials being utilized and the process program levels (2 and 3):\n\n\n\nThe first toxic alternate release scenario used anhydrous ammonia as the modeled substance.  The alternate release scenario of 60 pounds of anhydrous ammonia indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 miles.  This distance does not impact any public receptors.  There were no allowances for passive mitigation in the worst-case scenario distance model.  This scenario is based upon RMP Comp Version 1.07 software.\n\n\n\nThe second toxic alternate release scenario used aqueous ammonia as the modeled substance.  The alternate release scenario of 7,400 pounds of aqueous ammonia at a release rate of 148 lbs/min indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 0.3 miles.  This distance does not impact any public receptors.  The allowance used for passive mitigation was a drain located in close proximity to the aqueous ammonia system.  This scenario is based upon the RMP Comp Version 1.07 software.\n\n\n\nThe flammables alternate release scenario used butane as the modeled substance.  The alternate release scenario of 60 pounds of butane, resulting from a break in a transfer hose connection, indicates a 1 psi overpressure endpoint distance of 0.03 miles (reportable as 0.10 miles).  This distance does not impact any public receptors.  This scenario uses EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations model C-2, \"Equations for Estimation of Di"

This commitment is demonstrated by maintaining the implementation of the process safety requirements already in place.  Furthermore, the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design during construction and installation, is an investment in good business practices.  Inergy's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
