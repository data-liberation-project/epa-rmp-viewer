      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThe Hamilton Water Treatment Plant (HWTP) produces approximately 0.8 million gallons of potable water each day for the City of Hamilton.  The plant uses approximately 100-180 pounds/day of chlorine gas to purify the water.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists chlorine as a toxic substance that is potentially harmful to humans and the environment.  HWTP stores 4300 pounds of chlorine, liquefied under pressure, in (2) 1-Ton containers and (2) 150-pound cylinders.  The EPA requires the plant to have a Risk Management Program (RMP) because there is more than 2500 pounds of chlorine in storage.  \n\nThe City of Hamilton, like the EPA, are committed to chemical safety and thus created a RMP.  This commitment starts with the City Administrator and includes all of the Plant Operators.  The purpose of the RMP is to prevent any accidental releases of chlorine gas and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The City Administrator of Hamilton is responsible for the implementation and integration of the RMP.\n\nThe RMP consists of the following:\n? A worst case scenario giving the radius and population around the plant that could be exposed to high concentrations of chlorine gas.   \n? An alternative case scenario that is more realistic than the worst case scenario. \n? Five-year accident history detailing HWTP's accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past five years. \n? Management System for implementing and integrating the RMP. \n? Prevention Program detailing safety information, the hazard review process, operating procedures, training, equipment maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.\n? Emergency Response Program detailing emergency response procedures and accident investigation and reporting.\n? Planned Actions to Improve Safety at HWTP.        \n                                                                                                                                                                       Worst Case "

      "SummaryText": "Scenario\n\nThe largest quantity of chlorine released is assumed to be 2000 pounds (a 1-Ton chlorine cylinder) in 10 minutes.  The toxic zone around the plant is 1.3 miles with an estimated population of 530 (according to the U.S. Census Bureau).  The toxic zone is the area around the plant with an airborne concentration of chlorine gas above 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm), which is harmful to humans and environment. \n\nThe model used to generate the toxic zone is from EPA's regulations, 40 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 68.22, and program entitled \"RMP Comp\".  The model parameters, stated in 40 CFR 68.22, are reasonable and consistent with HWTP.  The model assumes the atmosphere to be very stable causing a chlorine release to remain relatively stagnant in the air.  \n                                                                                                                                                                  \nAlternative Case Scenario\n\nThis scenario assumes that one of the valves is broken off the chlorine cylinder resulting in a 1\" diameter hole.  This scenario assumes 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine (a 1-Ton chlorine cylinder) are released at a rate of 2500 pounds/min.  This rate is given in EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants 40 CFR Part 68\" for a liquid chlorine release through a 1\" diameter hole.  The release occurs in less than a minute and results in a 0.7 mile toxic radius around the plant.  The toxic zone has an estimated population of 150 (according to the U.S. Census Bureau).  \n\nThe model for this scenario is the same as in the worst case scenario.  This model is reasonable to assume because one of the valves can be broken off, which would result in a 1\" diameter hole in the cylinder.\n                                                                                                                                                                        Five-Year Accident History\n\nHWTP has not had any \"reportable\" acc"

This prevention program consists of the following sections:\n\nSafety Information-includes documentation of MSDS sheets, equipment specifications, codes and standards used to build, design, and operate the facility, safe upper and lower parameters in the chlorination system (such as temperature and pressure), and maximum intended inventory of chlorine.  The safety information will be updated when there is a change in any of the above information. This information ensures that HWTP knows the safety-related aspects of the chlorination process.\n\nHazard Review-includes a checklist and \"What-If\" questions. There are over 60 questions on the checklist and over 20 \"What-If\" questions.  The hazard review will be conducted once every five years or when there is a major change in the chlorination process. These questions and checklist help identify hazards and safety deficiencies at the plant.\n\nOperating Procedures-includes step-by-step instructions for unloading chlor"
