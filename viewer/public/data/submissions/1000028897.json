Stutsman, Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Johnson County LEPC, local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2)  Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the blending and storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received and stored at this facility, as well as distributed from this facility for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  In September of 2010, the system was improved by the addition of a rail off-load, a transport load-out, and a bulkhead.  The changes increased the efficiency and improved the safety of the entire system.   \n\n\n\nAn aqua-ammonia converter is maintained at this facility for the conversion of anhydrous ammonia to aqua-ammonia.  \n\n\n\nBetween 2 and 4 times per year, for a period of up to one week each time, Mears Chemical, a private contractor, sets up a mobile T-reactor on our facility for the production of 11-37-0 and 10-34-0, agricultural fertilizers.  For this process, Eldon C. Stutsman, Inc, provides only a safe processing location, water, and access to the railroad system.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia reported includes quantities of anhydrous ammonia brought in by rail for use in this process.\n\n\n\n3)  The Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n4)  The Emergency Action Plan"

The telephone number is (319)356-6028.\n\n\n\n5)  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  A process hazard review has recently been completed at the facility.  There are no additional safety recommendations specific to anhydrous ammonia scheduled for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\nFor further information contact:  Dave Henderson, Safety Director, Eldon C.
