The DuPont Washington Works site adheres to Corporate Safety Health and Environmental (SHE) policies.  For safety and environmental incidents, these policies could be summarized as follows:\r\n  -We believe all safety and environmental incidents are preventable.\r\n  -Our goal for incidents is zero.\r\n  -We are prepared for emergencies and we will provide assistance to our local communities to help in their emergency preparedness.\r\nCorporate Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) policies and RCMS policies are embodied in numerous site SHE procedures along with guidelines and recommended practices in DuPont Engineering Standards. Corporate SHE policies and Washington Works SHE procedures are available for review by all employees.\r\nAt Washington Works, SHE policies and procedures are also documented in the Washington Works SHE Manual.  Various procedures throughout the manual deal specifically with Process Safety Management elements to prevent incidents from occurring.  It is the responsibility of every employee and contractor working on our behalf to comply with these procedures.  It is management's responsibility to educate and train employees so they may understand and comply with the procedures. \r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\nThe DuPont Washington Works facility is a tenant of The Chemours Company FC, LLC located approximately five miles south of Parkersburg, WV.  DuPont manufacturing operations are located on approximately 65 acres.  Polymer resins and products in primary forms are manufactured at the site.  \r\nThe site uses the following EPA regulated RMP chemicals at levels above their process threshold quantities:\r\n               Toxics - formaldehyde\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe Washington Works site man"

The Emergency Response Program in place at Washington Works is such that emergency response is provided by the landlord, The Chemours Company FC, LLC.  DuPont area personnel are a part of the site's emergency response team and actively participate in drills and emergencies.  The emergency response personnel are trained and equipped to respond to accidental chemical releases.  The program can be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nTraining and preparation\r\n  -Plant personnel and emergency responders receive emergency response training.\r\n  -Emergency response plans are periodically reviewed and updated.\r\n  -The plant conducts periodic emergency drills, including critiques.\r\n  -A plant representative actively participates on the Wood County Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC).\r\n\r\nIf a release with the potential for off-site impact occurs:\r\n -The plant emergency alarm is sounded.\r\n -The plant Emergency Control Organization (ECO) Headquarters is activated.\r\n -Plant emergency personnel respond.\r\n -Community responders are notified and asked to respond as appropriate.\r\n -The local Industrial Alert System is activated if warranted.\r\n\r\nPrograms detailing emergency responder training and emergency equipment maintenance can be found in the Washington Works S&OH manual, ECO manual, and computer-based training programs.
