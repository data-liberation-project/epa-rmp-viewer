      "SummaryText": "Hydrol Chemical Company takes very seriously its committment to maintaining the safety of the residents of Yeadon Borough.  Our business supplies both the funereal industry and the diagnostic medical industry with the chemicals necessary for them  to perform their functions within our immediate community, as well as communities nation-wide.  The products that we produce are primarily made from formaldehyde solution, which is an EPA regulated hazardous substance.\n\nWorking with any EPA regulated substances entails that a company regard its very serious responsibility toward the safety of its workers, as well as the community it resides in.  Therefore, Hydrol has developed and implemented multiple types of spill prevention process controls, and an emergency response plan, to limit the possibility of an accident affecting the Yeadon community.  We pride ourselves in the fact that there have been no accidental spills of formaldehyde at Hydrol in over 10 years.  This tells us that the controls we have in place are well planned and reliable, and are treated with due diligence.  For example, our storage tanks are diked.  This limits the amount of formaldehyde that would be able to evaporate into the air if an accidental spill should occur by containing it in a small area.  Our tanks are also located within a separate room in the building allowing us to seal this area off if a spill occurred.  The use of an SCBA can then be used to assess situation a make repairs to limit spill.  These measures insure that an accidental spill would have no affect on the residents of Yeadon.\n\n\n\nHydrol knows this by performing calculations from EPA generated guidelines for accidental spills of hazardous substances.  In an EPA defined \"worst case acenario\" for an accidental spill, Hydrol could theoretically spill 18,000 lbs. From its largest storage tank.  Since Hydrol has in place a spill containment dike around this vessel, and it's enclosed in a sealable room, a spill of this naturewould hav"

      "SummaryText": "e little effect on the community, and any effectfelt would be well within a distance of 200 feet of the Hydrol property line.\n\n\n\nEven though a worst case scenario shows that a spill would have only a nominal effect, Hydrol has in place other measures to decrease the likelihood of a spill.  Our storage tanks are frequently inspected for worn or suspect controls, valves, and pipes, and are appropriately maintained to be in optimal performance condition.  Extensive records are kept to insure that preventative maintainence is performed in a timely manner.  Our employees are also well trained in spill prevention procedures and response.\n\n\n\nOur record and our committment to safety, though, is not enough.  Being complacent about accidental spills even with the record we have, is not the Hydrol way.  We constantly strive to improve our controls and procedures.  Every company must be ready for an accidental spill, no matter how unlikely.  Therefore, Hydrol does have an emergency response plan inplace if such an event should occur.  Specifically, the Yeadon Fire Company, Delaware County LEPC, DELCORA Water and Sewer Authority, and other associated authorities.  These institutions have in their possession appropriate information, plans, MSDS', etc. to be effective first responders, if necessary, to protect the community.  Hydrol also contracts with an excellent emergency response company, H.M.H.T.T.C. of Parsippany,  NJ, to respond to an accidental spill withntheir expert staff.  Hydrol Chemical Company believes that it has done its very best to prevent an accidental release of formaldehyde solution from occurring.\n\n\n\nHydrol Chemical Company, Inc. was inspected by the USEPA on November 22, 2011 to ensure compliance with Chemical Accident Prevention Program of Section 112 (r)(1) and (7) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), 42 U.S.C.&&7412(r)(1) and (7), and the regulatory program enacted pursuant to Section 112(r)(7), the Risk Management Program.
