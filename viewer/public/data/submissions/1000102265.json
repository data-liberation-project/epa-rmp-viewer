They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\n* Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\n\n* Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are pre-qualified based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  \n\n* Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\n\n* Replacement of all pressure relief valves occurs every five years.\n\n* Numerous of safety systems, including"

The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.

The new installation includes all stainless steel piping to prevent corrosion of the piping and reduce the potential for ammonia leaks.  The facility is to receive 8,000 pounds of anhydrous today and charge it into the new high pressure receiver and is scheduled to start up the system on September 24th & 25th, 2022.  Once the new system is up and running, the anhydrous ammonia from the old system will be pumped down into the new system by use of a couple of ammonia hoses.  We expect the total inventory to be 14,000 pounds.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the processing and storage temperature for cheese dips, Ready-to-Eat foods and related products.  It is a closed loop system that contains ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  Most of the ammonia equipment is located in the Machinery Room.  The condensing tower, air handler unit, and a small quantity of piping are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.

Unilever produced margarine under the brands Country Crock, Imperial and I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s not butter.  Unilever closed the facility on June 30, 2013.  There was a large ammonia refrigeration system with high and low stage compressors and suction traps installed in the basement.  There was an equipment auction and the screw compressors and some condensers were sold.  The equipment was removed with little concern for the condition the facility was left.  Ammonia lines ran all through the basement and were poorly marked.  Charley & Sons purchased the facility in February 2014 and began producing cheese sauces.  Charley & Sons used three reciprocal Vilter high stage compressors, a suction trap and transfer system and some of the ammonia lines running through the basement.  The refrigeration control system was by Hench Controls.  The control system at one time may have been \u201cstate of the art\u201d, but the Hench Controls no longer supported ammonia refrigeration controls and the facility's understanding of the system was limited.  Chairmans Foods purchased the facility from Charley & Sons on May 17, 2021 and are operating it as Gordo's LLC.  At the time of the purchase, the ammonia inventory was said to be less than 10,000 pounds.  Chairmans Foods calculated the inventory to be 6,345 pounds.  Chairmans Foods proceeded to build a new Machinery Room and discontinue use of all the refrigeration equipment, including the ammonia lines, located in the basement.  The only existing refrigeration equipment remaining to be are all the evaporators in the cooler, two evaporators in the RTE Pack-off Room and one air handlers located outside.  There is one existing ammonia condenser and two air handler units located outside that could be used in the future, but for now they are not connected to the new ammonia refrigeration system."
