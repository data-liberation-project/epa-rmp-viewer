EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.1      Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we store the following products (regulated substances):\n\nAmmonia\nArsine\nHydrogen Chloride\n\nThe containers are unloaded from a delivery vehicle for various periods of time, and then are loaded and delivered to the final user. These products are considered hazardous under the Federal RMP regulation.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the facility.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases. Employees at our site are members of the site?s emergency response team, which is trained to respond to and control accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\n1.2      The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and the redelivery of a variety of compressed gases and chemicals to the end user. The regulated substances are primarily used by Air Products? customers in the manufacture of electronic components.  The regulated substances are delivered to this facility in portable, DOT approved, shipping and storage containers. They are stored here until needed by the final user, at which time they are inspected p"

There is no chemical reaction involved, and neither is there any transfer of product from one container to another.  The regulated process is strictly the storage of the listed regulated substances in the containers in which they were received, until they undergo a pre-shipment quality assurance inspection and are loaded onto a delivery vehicle to be transported to the end user.\n\nFollowing is a listing of each regulated substance currently managed at our Santa Clara facility in amounts that exceed either the USEPA RMP threshold amount.  The listing provides each RMP regulated substance, it?s maximum container size, the maximum total on-site inventory, and which program(s) it qualifies for.\n\nAmmonia has a maximum on-site inventory of 18,400 pounds and a maximum single container size of 600 pounds.  Ammonia at Santa Clara is subject to RMP and PSM.\n\nArsine has a maximum on-site inventory of 1200 pounds and a maximum single container size of 50 pounds.  Arsine at Santa Clara is subject to RMP and PSM.\n\nHydrogen Chloride has a maximum on-site inventory of 15,314 pounds and a maximum single container size of 600 pounds.  Hydrogen Chloride at Santa Clara is subject to RMP and PSM.\n\nContainer sizes listed are the maximum sized container.  Some products also come in small containers.  The total quantity reflects a total of all sized cylinders for each product.\n\n\n1.3      The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply  with applicable state and industry codes.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps begin with the decision that all regulated substances would be on-site for storage only.  Further, the maximum cylinder size for Arsine h"

Products will be segregated by compatible hazards (pyrophorics, toxic hydrides, oxidizers, corrosives, flammables) to reduce the possibility of releases.\n\n\n1.4      Five-year accident history:\n\nSince the initial operation of this facility in June of 2001, there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of any of the covered chemicals that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n1.5      The emergency response progra:\n\nEmployees that are members of the on-site emergency response team at the facility will respond to emergencies beyond initiating emergency response from outside agencies.  All facility employees have been trained to OSHA?s HAZWOPER, First Responder Awareness Level in order to identify the need for an initiated response.  Retraining is conducted annually.\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Procedure Manual that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release. This information also contains the names and numbers of responding outside agencies.  Emergency actions and response for both flammable releases and toxic releases have been coordinated with Santa Clara City Fire Department.  Periodic drills are held in order to review these activities with the responsible responding units.\n\n1.6      Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures.\n\nThe facility has been in operation since 1 June 2001.  In 2003 major improvements to the site?s security system were installed and are now operational.  These improvements were inspected by the Santa Clara Fire Department.  Recently the facility has installed ?Y? racks storage units for ammonia and hydro"
