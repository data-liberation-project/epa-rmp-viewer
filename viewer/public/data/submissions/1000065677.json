LLC has developed a Process Safety Management (PSM) program for this process.  The PSM program was modeled after the Process Safety Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration guidance document by the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  The PSM program will serve as the Prevention program.  Hopkins Distribution Co. LLC developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the ammonia refrigeration system initially in 1990 and that plan currently remains in effect.  The EAP was most recently updated on 10/28/2012.  Palen-Kimball is prepared to respond to accidental releases to the extent allowable under the established emergency response procedures.  Hopkins Distribution Co. LLC and Palen Kimball have utilized the What If/Checklist technique endorsed by the IIAR in analyzing the process hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.",
