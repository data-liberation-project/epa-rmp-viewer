In addition, the refinery monitors contractor performance and\n\ncompiles a contract employee injury and illness log to ensure that a good safety record is maintained.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nLAR conducts PSSRs for all new facilities or modifications to facilities that change existing process safety information. These PSSRs ensure that important aspects of a project, such as safety, procedures, personnel, and equipment, are prepared and reviewed before equipment is placed in service.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nProcedures are maintained at LAR to ensure the integrity of process equipment including pressure\n\nvessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems/devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Inspection and testing are key components of the mechanical integrity program, with elements and frequency following accepted industry good engineering practices and manufacturers' recommendations augmented by operating experience. All work is documented. Deficiencies that are identified are corrected prior to further use of the equipment or reviewed by a qualified team to determine actions to be taken to ensure safe operations. Quality assurance measures are in place to ensure that new equipment is suitable to the service for which it is intended and is properly installed.\n\nMaintenance materials and spare parts are also checked for compatibility with the process and equipment. Employees involved in maintaining process equipment integrity are trained on the process, its hazards, and safe work practices and procedures.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nAdherence to safe work practices is deemed imperative at LAR to help ensure that operations and\n\nmaintenance activities are performed safely. These safe work practices include:\n\n1) a permitting system to authorize and control any hot work (spark-producing) activities,\n\n2) a confined s"

Managed changes include those to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures and facilities. Special consideration is given to the technical basis for the change, as well as safety and health impacts, operating procedure modifications, time period for the change and authorization requirements. All changes are reviewed and approved by knowledgeable personnel from various disciplines to ensure that potential new hazards are managed and any controls in place are not adversely affected. Affected employees and other workers receive training on the change prior to its implementation. In addition, process safety information and operating procedures are revised to reflect any changes.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nShould an incident occur that results in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of regulated\n\nsubstances, LAR promptly begins a thorough investigation. A knowledgeable investigation team determines the cause and develops corrective action recommendations to prevent recurrence. Refinery Management tracks the resolution of corrective actions. Investigation findings are available for review by all affected personnel.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nAudits to ensure the proper functioning of the accident prevention program are conducted at LAR at least every three years. A cross functional audit team carefully reviews facility practices and documents findings for management's review and implementation. Resulting corrective actions are electronically tracked until completion. The two most recent audit reports are kept on file.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe pre"
