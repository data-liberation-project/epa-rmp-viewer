The concern involved the population data source used in the offsite consequence analyses for the May 2022 submittal, which did not incorporate the most recent Census data. The population data was updated using 2020 Census data for the same release quantities and distances to endpoint.  Per the rule changes that went into effect in 2024, the new LEPC and Local Emergency Response Agency related questions were also answered with this correction.\n\nFlint Hills Resources Corpus Christi, LLC (FHR) is owner and operator of two petroleum refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas and has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and incorporating safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. This update is being submitted because of the shutdown of the Coker process unit.  This RMP is for FHR West Refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. \nThe FHR facility at Corpus Christi performs a number of processing functions that would traditionally be classified as Petrochemical Refining and Specialty Chemical Processing. For the remainder of this submittal, the FHR West refinery in Corpus Christi will be referred to as 'FHR' and the primary processing function at the facility will be generically referred to as 'Refining.'\nFHR's emergency response capabilities include a 24-hour, 365 day/year, fully paid, industrial emergency response group comprised of FHR Employees (FHR Captains on shift and daylight personnel). In addition, the dedicated emergency response team is supported by 80-100 Emergency response team members that are comprised of FHR Operations, Ready f"

Another aspect of our emergency response capabilities is notification of our adjacent neighbors through communications to LEPC Reverse Alert and a Radio Broadcast FM 87.5.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nFHR operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc. that are present in mixtures. Additionally, there is one EPA RMP toxic chemical handled above EPA RMP TQ at the refinery, and that is Hydrogen Fluoride.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no RMP defined accidents that have occurred over the past five years involving EPA RMP regulated substances for the qualifying units.\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at FHR. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. For process units containing threshold quantities (TQs) of highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) per OSHA PSM, the programs summarized below are applied equally to EPA RMP covered and EPA RMP non-covered process units.\nEmployee Participation\nFHR's policy is to encourage employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention programs. Examples of employee participation included updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information"

      "SummaryText": ", participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) teams and facilitating and participating in incident investigations. Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Additionally, the refinery has a number of processes that address process safety and accident prevention. These processes include teams such as the Central Environmental Health and Safety Council (CEHSC), Hazard Recognition Team (HRT), and the Refinery Process Safety Committee (RPSC). These teams contain members from across the refinery, including employees from operations, maintenance, engineering, as well as refinery management.\nProcess Safety Information\nFHR's policy is to maintain technical documents that are to be used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties, their associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Records Department within the refinery is the primary repository for process safety information. FHR also makes certain process safety information available on the FHR Intranet.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for certain process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit operating procedures. The refinery maintains these parameters within defined limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process e"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nWithin the PHA program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage potential hazards. FHR primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform the majority of the PHA evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique. The analyses are conducted with a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The PHA team is led by a leader with experience and qualification in the HAZOP analysis technique. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  In addition, the team may request further review of some scenarios through the use of Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) or Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) in order to further evaluate the controls in place.\nThe PHA team findings are typically addressed by assigning action items to appropriate refinery personnel. Implementation of action items in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking is intended to help ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. PHA action items are tracked and maintained in the FHR Compliance Action Item Tracking System. Within this system, an employee assigned an action is responsible for its execution by an assigned target date. Resp"

For delinquent action items supervisors are emailed notification of employee's outstanding action items and the supervisor is responsible for taking appropriate action.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, FHR's practice is to periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. The results and findings from base and revalidation PHAs are documented and retained. \nOperating Procedures\nFHR's policy is to maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\nIn addition, FHR's policy is to maintain upper and lower safe operating limits for process equipment in the Unit Operating Procedures and provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is available on the FHR Intranet and in the control room area.\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, FHR's policy is to implement a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training to confirm that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\nContractors\nFHR uses contractors to supplement its workforce as part of routine practices or during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Before a contract employer is accepted at FHR, the contract employer is required to complete a Management System Questionnaire (MSQ) indicating the contract employers' safety record in industry. The MSQ is FHR's initial screening process for accepting a contract employer to work at the refinery and also used as an ongoing screening tool to renew and approve continued support from contract employers.\nBecause some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place designed to oversee that contractors:\n- perform work in a safe manner,\n- have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\n- are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\n- understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,\n- understand and follow site safety rules, and\n- inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work permitting process prior to beginning work. In addition, FHR's practice is to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor per"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify aspects of readiness. A PSSR also involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \nMechanical Integrity\nFHR has practices and procedures for maintaining pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

FHR's practice is to incorporate quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This is intended to help ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\nSafe Work Practices\nFHR has safe work practices in place that are used to ensure worker safety within the facility.\nExamples of these include the following:\n- Security control and badge reader systems that regulate the entrance, presence and exit of all personnel and contractors at FHR,\n- Safe Work Permit Procedure, to ensure work to be performed in a process area is performed under the direction of a safe work permit,\n- Lockout/Tagout Procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources on equipment undergoing maintenance,\n- First Break Procedure for the safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, \n- Confined Space Procedure to ensure adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space,\n- Hot Work Procedure that is to be used to ensure adequate precautions are in place before performing hot work in a process area.\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, are used to form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\nManagement of Change\nFHR has a system to manage changes to processes.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. Employees involved in operating a process, maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are informed of and trained in, the change prior to start-up of the process or the affected part of the process.\nIncident Investigation\nFHR's policy is to promptly investigate incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss (as defined by EPA RMP), or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked and maintained in the FHR Compliance Tracking System. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

The final resolution of each finding is documented in the FHR Compliance Tracking System, and the two most recent audit reports are retained by the Process Safety Group.\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nMany processes at FHR have potential hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at FHR. Collectively, these prevention program activities are designed to help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, FHR has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\nRelease Detection\n1. Hydrocarbon, Hydrogen Sulfide, and Hydrogen Fluoride detectors with alarms\nRelease Containment/Control\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n4.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address various aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release with off-site consequences occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, FHR has procedures that are designed to address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that are to be used to address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. When necessary, the emergency response program changes are administered through the Safety Department, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\nThe overall emergency response program for FHR is coordinated with FHR Emergency Response Team, RTFC, Local Emergency Response Agencies and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC"
