              "Description": "The two regulated chemicals for this process are Epichlorohydrin (EPI) and Dimethylamine (DMA). The process is a batch process carried out in a jacketed pressure vessel (reactor). The reactor is protected from a catastrophic failure caused by over pressurization by the installed safety relief devices. The reactor pressure is also managed by batch sequencing throughout the batch process.\n\n\n\nThe largest quantity of EPI and DMA onsite are located in the respective storage vessels. They are equipped with safety relief devices to prevent a catastrophic release of EPI or DMA as a result of tank over pressurization. The EPI and DMA in the tanks are blanketed with nitrogen to prevent an explosive/flammable atmosphere in the tanks. The nitrogen pressure is set at 0.5 psig, which is below the pressure rating of the tanks. Pumps are used to transfer the EPI and DMA from tanker trucks to the bulk storage tanks. EPI and DMA are transferred to the reactors using centrifugal pumps. The transfer lines contain check valves that inhibit reverse flow from the reactor to the storage tanks to prevent contamination and/or over pressurization of the storage tanks.\n\n\n\nAll operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of EPI and DMA. They are also required to attend safety meetings. The operators and supervisors are instructed in the following areas: a) overview of RCRA rules and regulations; b) emergency response and spill prevention; c) Right-to-Know Laws; d) use of safety equipment; e) job-specific training; f) chemical safety training; g) respiratory protection; and h) confined space entry procedures. A file of safety data sheets (SDS) are readily available for the employees and the public at the site.\n\n",
