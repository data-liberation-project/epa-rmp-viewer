Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporator and is returned to the main suction accumulator.\r\n\r\nMain Suction Accumulator\r\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLiquid Transfer Vessel\r\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessel is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receiver. The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal cond"

The evaporative condenser receives high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supplies high pressure liquid to the thermosyphon vessel. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condenser contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nThermosyphon Vessel\r\nThe purpose of the thermosyphon vessel is to provide a supply of liquid ammonia necessary to cool the oil in the compressors. The thermosyphon vessel receives high pressure liquid from the condenser and supplies high pressure liquid to the thermosyphon oil cooler on each screw compressor. Excess liquid in the thermosyphon vessel is piped to the  high pressure receiver. High pressure ammonia vapor formed in each oil cooler is returned to the thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the thermosyphon vessel contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nOil Coolers\r\nThe purpose of the oil coolers is to remove heat from the oil being circulated through it. The oil coolers receive liquid from the thermosyphon vessel. High pressure liquid and vapor exits the oil coolers and is returned to the thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the oil coolers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia. \r\n\r\nSafety Systems\r\nThere are two ammonia sensors and a pressure transducer installed at Bravante Produce.

The relief valve discharge piping is terminated at the bottom of the ammonia adsorption tank. The ammonia adsorption tank is 10' dia. 22' high (12,950 gallon capacity). At a water level of 15'-0\", the tank contains 8,812 gallons of water which exceeds the quantity recommended by ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Addendum A \u00a715.5.3 which is based on 1 gallon of water per pound of ammonia released through the largest relief valve in the system in 60 minutes. Under normal conditions, the ammonia adsorption tank contains water.\r\n\r\nScrew Compressor Safety Devices\r\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment. The following list summarizes the safety devices built into each screw compressor package:\r\nHigh Discharge Pressure Cutout - The high discharge pressure cutout, will shut down the compressor if the discharge pressure equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\nLow Suction Pressure Cutout - The low suction pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the suction pressure is equal to or less than the setpoint.\r\nOil Pressure Cutout - The oil pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil pressure equals or deviates below the setpoint.\r\nHigh Oil Temperature Cutout - The high oil temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil temperature equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\nLow Oil Temperature Cutout - The low oil temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil temperature equals or falls below the setpoint.\r\nDischarge Temperature Cutout - The high discharge temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the discharge temperature equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\n\r\nHigh Level Float S"

      "SummaryText": "witch\r\nThe main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high liquid level in the vessel. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.\r\n\r\nMain Liquid Feed Shut-Off Valve (King Valve)\r\nThe high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system.\r\n\r\nEmergency Refrigeration Switches (E-Stops)\r\nEach entrance to the machinery room is equipped with an emergency refrigeration switch (e-stop) that controls power to the refrigeration machinery inside the machinery room. The switches can be activated in an emergency using the hammer next to the switch to break the switch glass.\r\n\r\nProcess Classification\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Bravante Produce consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Bravante Produce is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nBravante Produce has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders.\r\n \r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Bravante Produce facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 13,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this pr"
