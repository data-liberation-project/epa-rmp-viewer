Vernon, LLC (\"SABICa??) has a long-standing history of commitment and performance of safe operations, while providing economic stability to the region as Posey County's largest employer. To that end, we have developed an extensive program to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community. We operate under Process Safety Management guidelines, a rigorous set of standards that govern our daily control methods and behaviors.\n\nThese guidelines have been adopted to satisfy the stated policy of SABIC to safely manage our site operations. But more than just policy drives us to put safety ahead of all other factors, including financial issues. We pledge to take care of the people who work here and the community around us because they include our family, friends and neighbors.  In short, this region is our home. \n\nWe recognize that to do otherwise would weaken the economic foundation on which our community is built. The Mt. Vernon, IN site has been the backbone of the global SABIC business for more than 45 years and the people working on the site are committed to building upon that positive legacy for decades to come.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan contained in this report is a continuation of that effort, ensuring that there is a solid integration of our site emergency response resources with those available in the community, and that effective communication channels are in place.\n\nOur intensive series of internal reviews and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) external audit process have validated the strengths of the programs we have in place. We have been recognized by OSHA, under the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), as being among the best in the nation for worker safety.  We have been designated a STAR site, the highest recognition OSHA gives.\n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our fac"

Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority everywhere we do business.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  \n\nTo provide top-quality products for our customers, the manufacturing processes at the Mt. Vernon facility use some raw materials that are classified as toxic or flammable. While we strive for 100 percent compliance with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards, as well as systematic assessments used to manage and maintain safe operations with these materials, we routinely go far beyond the regulatory requirements.  Our operating practices and procedures, along with our automated control systems, ensure all steps are taken to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a major release, our trained on-site emergency response organization would be activated. This organization includes a fire brigade, medical, and chemical emergency response teams staffed with SABIC personnel who have collectively committed thousands of hours to training. Many of these individuals are so committed to emergency response that they serve on their community fire and emergency response departments as well. As a result, they devote much of their personal time to additional drills, training and community response.\n\nEffective maintenance and implementation of such a contingency plan relies on strong cooperation with the community's emergency response teams. We consistently network with other emergency response providers in our county, as well as those in neighboring counties"

SABIC employees are active members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the Advisory Liaison Emergency Readiness Team (ALERT) Committee, and the Disaster Recovery Business Alliance of Southwestern Indiana.\n\nThese alliances ensure that we'll be able to quickly activate and depend on internal, as well as external, emergency response resources should the need ever arise.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe SABIC plant is the largest fully integrated polycarbonate facility in the world, sitting on a 1000+-acre tract along the Ohio River, about two miles south of the city of Mt. Vernon, Indiana.  It was built in 1960 and currently employs 1279 people in the Southern Indiana area.  SABIC manufactures engineered plastics, marketed under trade names such as LEXAN(R), ULTEM(R), VALOX(R), and others.  Our products are used in a vast array of applications, including the automotive, medical, electronics, construction, computer, and appliance industries. \n\nUnlike most plastics manufacturing locations, the Mt. Vernon site houses four separate businesses, plus support services and research. The site is the headquarters to three of the SABIC Innovative Plastics US LLC businesses, as well as the Mt. Vernon Technology Department, where more than 80 top scientists and engineers work on the cutting edge of plastics innovation, developing materials and applications for new products and plastics manufacturing processes. \n\nBoth workplace safety and environmental protection are part of the culture at the SABIC facility, with more than $500 million being invested in the site since 1991 for expansion, capital improvement, safety and environmental protection. \n\nThe Mt. Vernon plant uses five chemicals that are regulated under EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  These are: Mono-methylamine (MMA), a regulated flammable substance; Phosgene, a regulated toxic substance; Chlorine, a regulated toxic substance; Nitric acid (concentration 80% or greater), a regu"

Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in our manufacturing process.   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSABIC complies with a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (or PSM). The programs ensure that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained. The programs satisfy the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP.\n\nSome of the many, specific safety features in place to prevent a chemical accident include:\n\nREGULATORY COMPLIANCE\n\nA?Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error, which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n\nA?Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks to contain a spill;\n\nA?Routine pipe and vessel inspection and testing;\n\nA?Written operating procedures that include emergency response actions;\n\nA?Comprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistent safe work-practices;\n\nA?Maintenance programs to ensure ongoing equipment reliability, including equipment testing and inspection;\n\nA?A safety procedure to review proposed plant modifications before they are implemented for possible hazards - this is called \"Management of Change\"; \n\nA?Safety pre-qualification for all contractors;\n\nA?Safety reviews prior to startup of our processes; and,\n\nA?Safety permitting procedures that control hazards during special operations such as welding and other maintenance activities.\n\nVOLUNTARY RISK REDUCTION\n\nA?Computer-controlled safety systems on the phosgene tanks and piping to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions a"

Vernon site has an outstanding record of accident prevention that demonstrates the commitment to employee and public safety.  Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.  In keeping with the requirement to report all incidents in the past five years that involved regulated chemicals and resulted in an off-site impact or had a significant on-site impact in this document, we are providing information about an incident that occurred at the plant within the past 5 years.\n\nOn July 18, 2004, a chlorine release of 1 pound occurred at the Brine plant due to a rupture of fiberglass vessels and piping in the low-pressure section of the chlorine manufacturing process. There was no offsite impact and no one was injured. There was on-site property damage.

Vernon site maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, the public, and the environment from all levels of accidental release. Our trained fire brigade, medical, and chemical response teams participate in a mutual aid agreement with emergency response providers within our own and surrounding counties and are active members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Disaster Recovery Business Alliance. These affiliations enable us to maintain close working relationships with area hospitals, industries, and other response organizations in the Southern Indiana area.  We've also invested in the equipment needed to respond to emergencies, both on-site and off-site, and staff a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week command center program. We consistently review existing systems and procedures to guarantee the best and most timely emergency response possible.\n\nFor example, emergency drills, organized and directed by the SABIC emergency teams have included: \n\nA?A simulated barge incident conducted with local industrial participants and U.S. Coast Guard officials; \n\nA?A simulated toxic gas site evacuation drill for all employees; \n\nA?A live incident command simulation involving the local EMA and LEPC;\n\nA?Annual site-wide fire and toxic material drills for all personnel; and\n\nA?A weekly test of the SABIC plant-site emergency alarm system.\n\nOngoing training exercises are important to the company's emergency response organization and help better prepare our partners in the community for emergency response necessary in the unlikely event of a major industrial incident. \n\nIn March 1985, in partnership with local industry and response organizations, SABIC introduced Advisory Liaison Emergency Readiness Team group (ALERT) siren system in the city of Mt.
