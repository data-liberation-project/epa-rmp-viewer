Chlorine is stored in and fed from one-ton containers that are delivered by truck.  Many safeguards are in place and are used throughout the system.  These were cited in the hazard review session and include:  ? Administrative controls, such as operating procedures, operator inspection rounds, lockout/tagout procedures, maintenance procedures, employee training, experienced personnel, and reliable vendors; ? Sensors and alarms for the presence of chlorine in the work area; and ? Design safeguards such as relief valves, isolation valves, and loss of vacuum shutdowns.  The prevention program addresses all the elements required for program level 2 processes, including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.",

This facility complies with industry-standard requirements for water treatment plants that use chlorine in ton containers.  The Board of Public Work's policy is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, our policy is to notify the Hannibal Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility and regulated substance   \nThis facility is a water treatment plant located in Hannibal, Missouri.  The facility employs a series of physical and chemical treatment operations that include: flocculation and sedimentation, disinfection, and final filtration  processes.  The covered process is the storage and feed of chlorine for the disinfection of water. The chlorine is provided through truck-delivered one-ton containers.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  The release scenarios have been performed in accordance with the regulation.\n\nFor both analyses, the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used.  The results were verified using RMP*Comp, which is based on the formulae in the guidance document.  The distance to endpoint for the chlorine worst-case release was 1.3 miles and for the alternative release, the distance was 0.1 mile.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program complies with the corresponding sections of EPA's 40 CFR part 68 accident prevention program rule for program level 2 processes and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorine system was designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state and local laws and industry codes.  To achieve and maintain this compliance, the Board of Public Works has in place man"

The procedural safeguards include an employee training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered processes.  The technological safeguards include controls, sensors, alarms, relief valves, and other safety systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of chlorine and, failing that, to minimize the effects of a release.\n\nFive-year accident history\nIn the last five years, this facility has not had an accident, involving chlorine, that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency response program  \nThe facility has a written emergency action plan that is coordinated with local emergency responders.  The Hannibal Fire Department is the primary responder.  Board of Public Works employees handle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so.\n\nThe emergency action plan includes emergency situation identification, procedures for reporting emergencies, evacuation, system shutdown, and responder notification.  The plan also addresses the interaction with the city fire department.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nThe maintenance and improvement of safety is an ongoing job at this facility.  Safety training takes place throughout the year.  Safety-related recommendations from employees, whether made during formal sessions like the hazard review or made upon observation of a potential hazard, are always considered carefully for implementation.  This feedback process is continuous and, even at times when no major process changes are anticipated, existing safety systems and procedures are fine-tuned as a matter of course.  Currently, the recommendations made during the recent hazard review are under consideration."
