VERNON, INDIANA\r\n\r\nRISK MANAGMENT PLAN\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \r\n\r\nCountrymark Refining and Logistics, LLC, (CountryMark), supports the concept and requirements of EPA's Risk Management Planning Regulations as outlined in 40 CFR Part 68 Section 112 (r ).  It is the policy of CountryMark to operate our facilities in a manner that will protect the health and safety of employees, the public and the environment.\r\n\r\nSource Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nCountrymark Refining and Logistics, LLC owns and operates a 28,800 barrel per calendar day petroleum refinery that produces quality motor and heating fuels for farm, commercial and residential use.  The refinery started production in Mt. Vernon, Indiana in the early 1940's. The CountryMark refinery employs approximately 205 people.\r\n\r\nThe refinery feedstock is a light (API 36), sweet crude oil typically from producers in Southern Illinois, Indiana, and Western Kentucky. Crude oil is gathered via a system of underground gathering pipelines and over-the-road transports. Crude oil from other US states can also be received by barge or from the Patoka crude oil terminal via pipeline. Finished fuel products are mostly farm (off-road) and non-farm highway diesel, and gasoline. Products are generally transported from Mt. Vernon to company owned terminals via the CountryMark owned and operated products pipeline system (a 238 mile long underground pipeline). A number of finished products including No. 6 fuel oil, gasoline, and diesel fuels are sold at the barge dock located one mile away from the site on the Ohio River while supplies of gasoline and No. 2 diesel are sold at an onsite two bay loading rack.  CountryMark's customer base is predominately agriculture, but commercial accounts serve all business sectors.  \r\n\r\nPetroleum refining uses heat, pressure and catalysts to process the raw crude oil into finished products. The covered processes at the refinery include"

      "SummaryText": "the Alkylation Unit which involves both a toxic chemical, hydrofluoric acid and flammable mixtures including isobutane, butane, butylene, propylene and propane. The other refinery process units contain flammable compounds including hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, butane, isobutane, propylene, butylene, isopentane and normal pentane. The process units are divided into two process area blocks based on location within the refinery. The storage of liquefied petroleum gases (isobutane, butane, olefins and propane) is also a covered process.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\r\nCountryMark is committed to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner while complying with governing laws, regulations and engineering standards.  This commitment is demonstrated through resources invested in safe design, operation and maintenance of the facility. CountryMark's operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent a release of toxic or flammable materials.\r\n\r\nIf a major release would occur, CountryMark has several layers of response that would be activated. Unit Operators are trained in initial responses to all types of potential incidents.  If warranted, the on-site Fire Brigade is called to provide the firefighting or emergency manpower requirements in the initial stages of a release. Next, a general community and industrial mutual aid fire response could be requested. Commercial emergency responders could also be obtained in addition to activation of all available emergency responders within a large radius of the refinery.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nCountryMark has a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals under the U.S. Occupational Safety and health Agency (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. The OSHA PSM program satisfies the EPA RMP requirements.  \r\n\r\nThere are many programs and procedures in place to prevent a chemic"
