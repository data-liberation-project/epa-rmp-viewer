Many of our employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committees.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility is a chemical distribution warehouse.  The regulated substances arrive at the warehouse loading dock, are transferred to storage, and subsequently loaded for shipment.  The covered chemicals are not processed while on-site.  The regulated substances handled are hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashdist.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.  The USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulat"

Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite industrial/commercial receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.  The passive mitigation considered in the analysis was the storage of the drummed hydrochloric acid in an enclosed building.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenarios.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  The USEPA requires that the results of the alternative-case release scenario analysis be reported for each toxic present.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenarios for hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide would only impact offsite industrial and commercial receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or active mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distances reported.  The passive mitigation considered in the analysis was the storage of the drummed hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide in an enclosed building.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place along with written operating procedures.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency repo"

This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.  \n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nWe have never had a release of hydrochloric acid or ammonium hydroxide that resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact.  \n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees do not respond offensively to accidental releases of the regulated substances, but rely on local emergency responders when there is a need for response.  Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response activities.  This facility regularly invites the local fire department and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plant and gain familiarity with our operations.  This facility has a written emergency preparedness plan that is updated regularly.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews.  We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.  Ashland is committed to the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible CareSM Initiative Management Code on Process Safety."
