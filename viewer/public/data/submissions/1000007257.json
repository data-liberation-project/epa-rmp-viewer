Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application through sales to farmers.  Access to the site is resticted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personel, and authorized contractors.  The maximum intended inventory of our ammonia storage tank, and nurse tanks is 315,000 lbs.\n\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility. Failure of our storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have offsite consequences. We have check valves and relief valves along with manual shutoff to help reduce the chance of failures.\n\nThis facility complies with EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requrements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1 and the stadards of OSHA,29 CFR 1901.111 Storage and Handling of Anydrous Ammonia.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injury, property or enviromental damage, evacuation or sheltering in place.We have not had a release with offsite cosequences in the past 5 years.\n\nIn the event of an emergency in volving our anhydrous ammonia system it is our policy to notify the Winside Fire Department, and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and they have inspected our system.\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at our facility.  Periodic evaluatio"
