Subsidiary concerns are minimization of damage to the environment or Knouse Foods equipment, property and product as well as compliance with the regulations.\n\n\n\nControlled-Atmosphere Refrigeration System \n\n\n\nKnouse Foods, Mountain Orchard Facility is a process and storage facility for apples.  The facility is equipped with an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system serving coolers and freezers.  The total system capacity of refrigerant is 11,500 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was calculated to be the failure of the largest single ammonia storage vessel in the refrigeration system.  The vessel holds 4,944 pounds of ammonia during normal operating charge and all 4,944 pounds would be released if the vessel failed.  The off-site consequences analysis for the worst-case release scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp v.1.07.  The release duration was 10 minutes with a release rate 494 pounds per minute (lbs/min).  Mitigation measures considered included release into the building.  The results of the modeling indicated that the toxic endpoint of 0.14 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of ammonia would be reached at a distance of 0.40 miles from the release point.\n\n  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumed that a leak develops in the piping system of the refrigeration system.  Based on the current ammonia detection systems and procedures for quickly responding to the alarm, it was assumed that 25 pounds of ammonia would be released.  The off-site consequences analysis for the alternate release scenario was mod"

The results of the modeling indicated that the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia would be reached at less than 0.10 mile from the release point.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nKnouse Foods has developed and implemented a PSMP in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Standard 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, for operation of the ammonia refrigeration system at Knouse Foods, Mountain Orchard Facility in Aspers, Pennsylvania.  The PSMP has been revised to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations, 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe PSMP and RMP for the Knouse Foods, Mountain Orchard Facility includes detailed sections on the following:\n\n\n\n* Employee Participation\n\n* Process Safety Information\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n\n* Operating Procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Contractor Safety\n\n* Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n* Mechanical Integrity\n\n* Hot Work\n\n* Management of Change\n\n* Incident Investigation\n\n* Emergency Planning and Response\n\n* Compliance Audits\n\n* Off-site Consequences Analysis.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the PSMP and RMP, Knouse Foods maintains the following documents as part of the safety program at Knouse Foods, Mountain Orchard Facility:\n\n\n\n* On-site Emergency Response Plan, Mountain Orchard Facility\n\n* Evacuation Plan, Mountain Orchard Facility\n\n* Employee Evacuation Instructions, Mountain Orchard Facility\n\n* Work Rules publication\n\n* Knouse Foods Safety Program (manual).\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nKnouse Foods maintains detailed hazardous materials incident reports for the ammonia refrigeration system.
