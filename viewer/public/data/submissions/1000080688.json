The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility:\n\n\n\nIt is the intention of Western Management to commit to the personal, property, and environmental safety to all surrounding life and environment that could possibly be affected in any manner by the business conducted at this facility.\n\n\n\nOur policy is SAFETY FIRST.  The personal safety of each employee of this company is of primary importance.  To the greatest degree possible, management will provide all mechanical and physical facilities required for personal safety.  Our objective is the safety program reducing our exposure to accidents to the absolute minimum.\n\n\n\nSafety Audits are done at our facilities to insure compliance with all regulations and safety practices.\n\n\n\nOUR GOAL IS ZERO ACCIDENTS AND ZERO INJURIES. Through a cooperative effort by each employee, we will attain our goal.\n\n\n\nWe recognize the responsibilities for safety are shared:\n\n\n\n1.  The employer accepts responsibility for leadership of the safety program, for its effectiveness, and safeguards providing a safe work place.\n\n\n\n2.  Employees are responsible for wholehearted cooperation of the safety program, including compliance with all rules, and practicing safety while performing their duties.\n\n\n\nEmployees are very actively involved in the safety program.  Western has monthly safety meetings for all employees.  The evacuation plan is practiced regularly.  \n\n\n\nOur policy is SAFETY FIRST.  The personal safety of each employee of this company is of primary importance.\n\n\n\nB. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nWestern manufactures acetylene gas at this facility. The stationary source of this RMP would be a trailer that holds approximately 225 cylinders of acetylene. These cylinders are connected through a common\n\nmanifold header. The amount of acetylene in an entire trailer is less than 6,800 pounds. Several trailers could be present at the location at any time.\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nC. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nWestern complies with the OSHA PSM regulations and NFPA 51A guidelines. \n\n\n\nWestern takes pride in having done it right the first time before an accident or incident would require any form of additional safety measures.  This facility has multiple gas monitors throughout the production areas and fire detectors.  The monitors are set to alarm at 10 % of the lower explosive limit (LEL). \n\n\n\nD. The five year accident history:\n\n\n\nOne accidental release of approximately 126 pounds of acetylene. One on site injury with no offsite injuries or impacts. No evacuations were required.  \n\n\n\nE. The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nCoordination of emergency response for this facility consists of tours taken by the Salem Township Fire Department and Local EMS system.  Western invites the local Fire Department to our facility as part of their training program to familiarize them with our facility and products.  These tours and training received count as required hours the Fire Department members to remain certified. \n\n\n\nAll Western personnel also receive training on the emergency action plan.  Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually or whenever a change in process would occur.  In addition, employees are trained on the emergency shutdown procedure for the acetylene process, including the activation of the deluge system. Monthly safety meetings are held with all employees.  Alert systems within the facility consist of an word of mouth, evacuation horn, audible paging system, and by handheld cellular phones. \n\n\n\nF. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nIt is the intentions of management and this company to continue to train and strive for excellence in the industrial gas business.  We believe that properly trained personnel are safe personnel and therefore have no intentions of reducing the importance of safety.  Safety First will remain the policy for this company. "
