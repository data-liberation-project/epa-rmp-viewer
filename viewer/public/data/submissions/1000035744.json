This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including training of personnel and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the processes at the CRNF Plant.  CRNF implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. CRNF places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection, and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspection and regularly training responsible personnel. Should a release occur, the plant's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\n2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nCRNF operates a variety of processes to produce anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions. The CRNF Plant has several processes that contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, and a flammable mixture consisting of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide and methane.  The CRNF Plant includes a total of six (6) RMP covered processes. The CRNF Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.\n\n\n\n3 WORST CASE SCENARIO EVALUATION\n\n \n\nCRNF has evaluated worst case scenarios for both the release of a regulated substance and also for a flammable mixture.  Potential alternate cases for a regulated substance and flammable mixture were also evaluated.  Based on the results of these evaluations, CRNF has put in place response training and procedures to prevent or mitigate the potential for off-site consequences.\n\n\n\n4A GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe CRNF Plant h"

The accidental release prevention program required for Program 3 processes is summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective accident prevention program, as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis. The process safety information is readily available to all employees and used by plant personnel, the process hazard analysis team, and persons in charge of updating the emergency response plan. CRNF maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operations. These documents address toxicity information, chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration. Chemical specific information, including physical data, reactivity data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, permissible exposure limits, hazards of inadvertent mixing of materials, and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).\n\n\n\nCRNF also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment at the plant. This information includes, but is not limited to, materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and plant changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled.

The analyses are conducted using a team of plant personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise and may include third parties knowledgeable in the process hazard analysis methodology being used. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are needed. Any identified risks are promptly addressed. Resolution of each finding is documented and records of the analyses are retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years unless review is warranted sooner due to a significant change at the plant. Once again, the reviews are documented and records of the review are retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nCRNF maintains written procedures at the plant that address each operating phase of process operations such as: (1) initial start-up; (2) normal operations; (3) temporary operations; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) emergency operations; (6) normal shutdown; and (7) startup following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown. These procedures also address operating limits, safety and health considerations and safety systems and their functions.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures are reviewed periodically and as operational changes are introduced, and annually certified as current and accurate.

Instructions include applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications. Operating procedures ensure that all employees operate the processes in a prescribed, consistent, and safe manner.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nCRNF has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the processes at the plant. New employees receive training in an overview of the process and procedures and other safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted as frequently as needed but no less often than every three years. All training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nCRNF has practices and procedures for maintaining process vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps at the plant. The aspects of this program include: (1) training; (2) written procedures; (3) inspection frequency and testing procedures; (4) correcting identified equipment deficiencies; and (5) applying quality assurance measures. These activities form a system to maintain the mechanical integrity of the processes.\n\n\n\nCRNF incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.

Reviews ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate a change. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are notified of changes and, if necessary, trained on the changes.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review \n\nCRNF conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) on any new process or process modification that is significant enough to require a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to introducing regulated substances into the process. This review provides an additional check that construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCRNF periodically conducts and certifies that they have performed audits to determine the implementation of the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\n\n\nAn audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.
