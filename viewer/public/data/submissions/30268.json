We also have a commitment   to review our policies and procedures periodically to improve our safety program.  The City's wastewater treatment facilities use the chemicals Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide as part of its process for disinfection of treated wastewater and for the removal of residule Chlorine ( Chlorine that is left  over after the disinfection process is complete) before it is discharged into the bay or river. The wastewater facilities do not manufacture the Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide. The chemical is ordered form an outside company and brought by truck to the facilities in 2000 pound containers designed specifically for these chemicals. The Worst Case and Alternate scenerios in the City's program were developed using the Enviromental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68). A Worst case scenerio would be a catastrophic failure of all safety systems and no response from trained emergency responderes. The Worst Case scenerio is unlikely to happen because of several safety systems in place. First, the chemical containers are inspected by the company that supplies the chemicals to assure they meet safety specifications designed for those containers. Second, the systems used to draw the chemicals out of the containers are a total vacuum system. The systems have a vacuum regulator valve attached to the container that is designed to shut off automaticlly in the event there is a break in the system stopping any release of the chemical. Third, the vacuum system is formally inspected by trained operators once every three months and visually inspected every time an empty container is changed to a full one. Fourth, in the event a leak occurs due to failure of all safety systems, we have operators on call that are trained in the firs"

These operators also have links to off-site responders such as the Hazard  Material Team from the company that supplies the chemicals and the local Fire Department. Through careful handling practices and safe procedures using these gases, the City has never had an accident. The City has a training porgram in place for the operators at all of its wastewater treatment plants. The operators have hands-on training exercises every three months using the leak repair equipment and personal protective equipment. The operators also have communication links with the Fire Department, which has access to the emergency siren alert system. The alert system is a set of sirens stationed in various areas around the town that are used by the City and Industry to alert citizens in the event of a chemical release.  When the sirens are sounded, residents can be imformed of the event through a local emergency radio station. The City's Wastewater Treatment  Divison reviews its safety procedures at its quartely safety meetings and takes consideration of new ideas that may improve safety practices. The City will continue to monitor its practices to provide a safe environment for the public as well as our personnel."
