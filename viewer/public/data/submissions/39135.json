      "SummaryText": "Brakebush Brothers, Inc., located at N4993 6th Drive, Westfield, WI., is a family owned poultry processing facility that has been in operation in this area for over 75 years. Anhydrous ammonia is use as a refrigerant at this facility of processing and to provide cooling for storage rooms. Our refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low sideof 15\" vacuum to a high side of 210 psi.  The maximum amount of ammonia in the system at any one time is estimated at 364,000 pounds.\n\nWorste-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Substance:\nOur worste case release is the failure of the High Pressure Receiver in our refrigeration system.  The High Presure receiver (HPR) mesures 8' x 14' with a  maximum capacity of 26,000 pounds. Located outside the building, no passive mitigation was considered.  Although the normal operating level of this reciever is between 8,600 to 13,000 pounds, the worste case analysis takes into account the possiblity the HPR would be full.  Using the tables and equations found in chapter 4 of EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration,  the toxic endpoint was calculated at 2.9 miles.  Based on census data, within this radius in a population of 500,residential housing, and a few retail businesses.  There are no hospitals or schools located within this area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for a Toxic substance:\nThe alternative release toxic endpoint was also determined using EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference table and equations.  A pressure relief valve failure was the likely cause of an ammonia release.  Usingthe tables provided in th RMP Guidance, a 10 minute release of ammionia at 540 lbs/min., from the High Pressure Receiver relief valve, would affect an area of 0.40 miles.  The estimated population within distance of endpoint is 10.  There are some resident and retail businesses but there are on schools of hospitals.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\nBrakebush "

The estabilished steps include initial training under the OSHA Requlation 20 CFR 1919.120 HAZWOPER.  The facility has also established annaul retrainig for all personnel that are on th HAZMAT Team to establish a joint repsonse program.  These esablished plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nBrakebush Brothers, Inc., has trained selected personnel, including refrigeration operators in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Repsonse, OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.120.  The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate.  This could be by tighting a packing nut of a flange bolt or initiating a system shutdown.  Brakebush Brothers has established written operating procedures for the ammoina refrigration system and has included in those proceudres the Emergency Shutdown and isolation in the event of a release.  Brakebush Brothers has also purchased HAZMAT Team hs been trained in the ICS system and will coordinate their efforts with the Marquette County HAZMAT Team.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nBrakebush Brothers, Inc., has had a  reportable release on January 2, 2004 with a total amout of 600 lbs of ammionia lost.  This release was due to a gasket failure on a ammonia compresser. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention  Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nBrakebush Brothers, Inc., has not only complied with the EPA Risk Management Program but also the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation to assure that the Ammonia Refrigeration System is well maintained and the employees are properly trained and periodically retrained to assure they are kept up to date on any changes and new operations that may effect them.  In addition, they maintain the mechanical integrity and safety of this process"
