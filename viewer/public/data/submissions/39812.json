The following summarizes the programs, policies, and procedures in place to reduce the risk of hazardous materials release:\n\nThe Express Cooling facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to seasonal startup and during operations.  These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases.  Onsite personnel, plant engineers, and licensed refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment.\n\nThe operations at this facility are seasonal with operations occurring primarily between the months of March through November during the produce growing season.  The equipment is inspected during off-season and any repairs or change outs are made at this time.  This off-season time is used to prepare the equipment for non-stop operation during the season.\n\nThe refrigeration system is monitored and controlled by an Andover computer control system.  This system monitors the refrigeration process parameters and the system ammonia leak detectors.  Each on-call operator carries a pager.  The operators will be paged by the Andover system in the event of out of specification system operation or on the detection of an ammonia release.\n\nOperators and onsite personnel provide initial emergency response.  Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will perform controlled operations"

Records will be kept of all training courses attended.\n\nAll ammonia refrigeration maintenance and operations personnel are required to be trained and become familiar with the company?s Safety, Maintenance and Operating Procedures, Emergency Response Plan as well as to become familiar with this RMP.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe Express Cooling/American Growers facility utilizes Anhydrous Ammonia in their produce and cold storage operations.  The refrigeration plant is comprised of one stationary process that provides refrigeration for cold rooms, portable vacuum cooling, and pressure cooling and storage for processing and shipment.  Produce includes a variety of field pack produce products.\n\nAmmonia is the only listed material used at this facility.  \n \nThe ammonia charge is contained primarily in the high-pressure receivers and the low-pressure pump receivers.  The remainder of the refrigerant is contained within the piping and refrigeration coils.  In the refrigeration system low-pressure vapor is drawn from the low-pressure receivers by the compressors.  The vapor is drawn off of the receivers by the compressors in accordance with desired suction pressure.  The lower the pressure the lower the temperature of the refrigerant.  The low-pressure vapor is then boosted to a high pressure by the compressor.  This high-pressure vapor flows to the condensers where it is cooled and condensed into a high-pressure liquid. This high-pressure liquid flows to the pressure receivers through the plant piping system by differential pressure.  The liquid is reduced to low pressure after flowing through an expansion valve.  The cold low-pressure liquid is then pumped or fed by gravity to the cooling coils.  The cold liquid refri"

      "SummaryText": "gerant absorbs heat from the stored products during the cooling process.  This heat causes the refrigerant to evaporate and the vapor is returned to the low-pressure receivers.  The compressors then draw off this vapor and the process repeats itself.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may cause suffocation or shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. *\n\n*See Material Safety Data Sheet for anhydrous ammonia, (Appendix I)"
