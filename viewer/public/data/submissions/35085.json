Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Citizens Gas & Coke Utility - Manufacturing Division:\n\nCitizens Gas & Coke Utility is a non-profit public charitable trust established for the benefit of our customers.  The management of the Utility is vitally interested in the safe operation of our facilities and the protection of human health and the environment.\n\nCitizens Gas & Coke Utility has adopted a safety policy to promote, achieve, and insure the safe conduct of Utility operations for the benefit of all employees, customers, and the general public. Each employee is charged with maintaining a safe work area at all times.\n\n1.) The dignity and importance of each employee and each employee's right to derive personal satisfaction at work can be realized only when safety is the first consideration in conducting all Utility operations.\n\n2.) We expect all employees to demonstrate a continuous awareness of safety consideration as an integral part of all operations to achieve the goals of accident prevention and efficient productivity.\n\n3.) The Utility will provide proper tools and material, equipment, and facilities, all in safe operating condition, and sufficient training to achieve a safe work environment, so that employees may devote their energies toward productive work without fear of harm to life and health.\n\n4.) We require each employee to understand and strictly observe all Utility rules and safety regulations. Enforcement of these safety rules and regulations is mandatory.\n\nCitizens Gas & Coke Utility takes safety very seriously. We use a variety of safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of releases that may occur.\n\nII.  Description of the Manufacturing Facility at Citizens Gas & Coke Utility.\n\n1.) The manufacturing plant is located in Indianapolis, IN between Southeastern Blvd. and Prospect St. The plant covers approximately 90 acres and employs 340 people. The plant is the first coke plant i"

The chief product manufactured at the facility is coke.  Coke is essentially a lump of carbon that has an appearance similar to coal. Coke is used in the blast furnace for the production of steel and in cupola's for the production of iron castings. The castings are used for automotive parts, industrial parts, piping, sewer covers, etc. Coke is also used for processing sugar beets, producing mineral wool, and smelting various metals.\n\nCoke is produced by baking coal in ovens that operate at high temperatures typically around 1800 degrees F. The coal remains in an oven between 24 and 31 hours. During this time the volatile matter in the coal is driven off in the form of gas leaving behind carbon which is the main component of coke. The red hot coke is pushed out of the oven and quenched with water. The coke is then screened to separate the various sizes and shipped to our customers.\n\nThe plant has 3 batteries of coke ovens. E Battery and H Battery have a combined total of 88 ovens. Each of these ovens can hold a 13 ton charge of coal and the batteries carbonize about 315,000 tons of coal per year. The #1 Battery has 72 ovens. Each of these ovens can hold a 27 ton charge of coal and this battery carbonizes about 635,000 tons of coal per year. The total coke output of the plant is approximately 655,000 tons per year.\n\n4.) The plant produces coal tar, light oil, sulfur, and coke oven gas from the gaseous volatile matter released from the coal.  The coal tar is separated from the gas by cooling the gas to around 90 degrees F and by electrostatic precipitators. The gas is cleaned by a series of scrubbers which remove ammonia, sulfur, and heavy hydrocarbons. After separation and treatment the coal tar and light oil are sold to refiners and have a variety of end uses such as roofing material, cosmetics, and other industrial products. The sul"

The processes and materials handled at the facility that are included in the risk management plan are described below.\n\n      a.) Coke oven gas manufacturing is a Program Level 3  Process because of the flammability of the gas, the quantity of gas stored on-site, and the potential for offsite consequences.  Coke Oven Gas is a mixture that contains several regulated chemicals. The two most predominant chemicals are methane and hydrogen. Coke oven gas is present throughout the facility in piping or in relatively small vessels. The vast majority of coke oven gas stored  on-site is in a telescoping low-pressure holder that has a maximum capacity of 6 million cubic feet. \n\n      b.) The strong ammonia liquor process is a Program Level 1 Process due to the toxicity of ammonia, the quantity stored on-site, and because there is no potential for offsite consequences. The strong ammonia liquor contains about 25% ammonia. It is typically stored in a single storage tank that is located near the center of the plant. The liquor originates from the ammonia destruct system. The purpose of this system is to remove ammonia from the coke oven gas and to destroy the ammonia in a catalytic reactor. One reactor is normally on line and another reactor is available as a spare. The strong ammonia liquor is only produced on the rare occasion when both reactors are shutdown for repair. The liquor is destroyed when the ammonia destruct reactor is operating. As a result, the inventory of liquor is generally very low. \n\n      c.) The waste water treatment process is a Program Level 1 Process due to the toxicity of formaldehyde, the quantity stored on site, and because there is no potential for offsite consequences. The waste water treatment plant treats the process waste water resulting from the coking process. The waste water originates fro"

      "SummaryText": "m the moisture in the coal and the cleaning process for the coke oven gas. The waste water treatment plant is a conventional aerobic biological treatment system that consists of aeration basins and clarifiers. A 37% Formaldehyde solution is added to the waste water at the end of the treatment plant to polish the effluent. The formaldehyde is stored in a single tank that has complete secondary containment.\n\n\nIII. The General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\n      The facility is also regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management rule.  We use a variety of safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of releases that may occur.\nPrevention measures include: \n1)  Safety controls such as leak detectors, warning alarms, and automatic shutdowns.\n2)  Regular equipment inspections, predictive maintenance and preventative maintenance to ensure  proper operation.\n3)  Incident investigation procedures to develop corrective actions.\n4)  Trained operators are onsite 24 hours per day to monitor the process and to take action when necessary for safe operation.\n\nIV. Five Year Accident History:\n\n      There were no reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\nV. Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe Indianapolis fire department tours our facility at least once per year to keep updated on our process and to plan responses. All personnel are regularly trained on safety and accident prevention.\n\nVII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n1)  Recently a safety director  was named that has overall responsibility for safety in the Utility. \n2)  Continue to track new government regulations for immediate implementation.\n3)  Continue to work with local and national industry partners in developing systems/procedures to strive for an accident free work place."
