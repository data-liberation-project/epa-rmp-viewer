This facility produces groundwater for distribution to residential and commercial customers.  Chlorine is used at the facility to disinfect the groundwater prior to storage and distribution.  Currently, a maximum of 4,000 pounds of chlorine is maintained on the site.  No other toxic or flammable substances, as listed in 40 CFR 68, are stored or utilized at the facility.  Chlorine is stored under pressure in one-ton containers.\r\n\r\nSafety Policies\r\nThe Aqua Water Supply Corporation is fully committed to safety at the Delhi Treatment Plant.  As a result of the Risk Management rules, Aqua is working to coordinate with the Bastrop County Sheriff's Department to establish viable emergency response procedures.  Aqua Water Supply Corporation is committed to a process of continual improvement in its risk management program at the Delhi Treatment Plant.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe Commitment to managing risks associated with chlorine is demonstrated by Aqua's excellent track record with respect to handling chlorine.  The Delhi Treatment Plant has not experienced an accident related to chlorine within the past five years.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\r\nAs required by the risk management regulations, the offsite consequence analysis required development of worst-case release and alternative-release scenarios for chlorine.  Realistic potential alternatives were modeled, with consideration toward actual condition at the site.  The resulting radii  of impact are therefore useful tools for emergency response teams in planning for and responding to emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program Description\r\nThe prevention program represents the core of the day-to-day means by which accidental releases of regulated substances into the air will be minimized.  This component will be used primarily by plant personnel responsible"

The prevention program will also become a useful tool in ongoing training of plant personnel.\r\n\r\nThe Program 3 Prevention Program includes twelve primary components:\r\n\r\n1.  Process Safety Information:  Up-to-date safety information has been compiled relating to regulated substances, processes, and equipment.  Safety information will also be updated any time a major change occurs that would make the safety information inaccurate.\r\n\r\n2. Process Hazard Analysis:  Regulated processes at the facility have been reviewed to identify potential hazards.  The results have been documented in a hazard review report.  Problems identified by the hazard analysis are being resolved in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n3.  Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures have been prepared providing instructions for safely conducting activities associated with regulated processes.  These procedures will also be updated should a major change in the handling or storage of regulated substances occur.\r\n\r\n4.  Training:  Plant personnel responsible for operating regulated processes receive training in the processes.  Periodic refresher training is required.\r\n\r\n5.  Mechanical Integrity:  Procedures have been implemented to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the process equipment is maintained.  Ongoing training of personnel responsible for maintenance is also required.  Inspection and testing of regulated process equipment is a requirement as well.\r\n\r\n6.  Management of Change:  Procedures have been implemented to manage changes to the chlorine process in order to ensure that employees are aware of the changes and have been trained in the modified system.\r\n\r\n7.  Pre-Startup Review:  Procedures have been implemented to perform an audit of modified chlorine processes to ensure that appropriate modifications to the Risk Management Program have been made as a result of the process change.\r\n\r\n8.

The results of the audit will be documented, and deficiencies corrected.\r\n\r\n9.  Incident Investigation:  Should an incident involving a release, a near release, of a regulated substance occur, it will be investigated promptly.  The findings of any such incident investigation will be used to improve the safety of the process.\r\n\r\n10.  Employee Participation:  The prevention program has been designed to incorporate the knowledge and experience of the employees by providing for their participation in Risk Management Program reviews, investigations of incidents, audits of the program, training, and other important aspects of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n11.  Hot Work Permit:  The Maintenance procedures include provisions for hot-work permits to reduce hazards that could be caused by performing work near chlorine processes.\r\n\r\n12.  Contractors:  Procedures have been implemented that clearly identify the risk management responsibilities of contractors who perform chlorine-related work on the facility site.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Progeam\r\nAqua Water Supply Corporation has determined that the Delhi Treatment Plant will assume a non-responder status with respect to accidental releases of chlorine.
