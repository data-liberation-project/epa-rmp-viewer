We contract with a third party to produce ammonium polyphosphate fertilizers from anhydrous ammonia and other ingredients on our site and sold for use by the area agricultural community.  The facility was designed to capture any controlled release of liquid product from an accidental spill while loading a vehicle or the blending of different materials.    \n\n\n\n    Our employees are trained to handle emergencies from chemical spills to health related injuries and emergencies, including the use of CPR and an automatic external defibrillator (AED).  We train in accordance with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the local Fire Department.  Our staff routinely updates our Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and files annual reports with the state and county emergency management agencies.  We are committed to maintaining a clean environment because it is the environment we all live in.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\n    The Winona facility handles one product that subjects us to the Risk Management Plan requirements -- anhydrous ammonia.  We use anhydrous ammonia to blend with phosphoric acid to make a poly phosphate fertilizer commonly called 10-34-0 or ammoniated poly-phosphate.  The anhydrous ammonia used in this blending process is shipped in to our Winona facility via railroad cars and off loaded by trained, licensed and certified contractors who mix the ingredients in a special blender and then cool the product down before they pump it in to our tank.  Our personnel do not touch these operations and are not involved in the blending process.  This is done for safety and quality purposes.  The blending and unloading of these specialized products is best done by personnel that handle these "

      "SummaryText": "products all the time.\n\n\n\n    The anhydrous ammonia is on our railroad siding for less than a week and is secured by a fence with a camera monitoring any car movement or other activity.  The cars are opened and monitored by third party professionals.  As for all the other non-hazardous products we have on site, we take great care to see to it that if a leak should occur we are ready with equipment and knowledge to contain that leak and manage the clean-up so zero environmental damage results.  We do not store hazardous materials in our tanks at Winona.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\n\n\n    The contractors who manage the unloading of the anhydrous ammonia use numerous tools and control systems to prevent any accidental releases.  Remote controlled shut-off valves, pressure relief controllers and temperature monitoring systems are all connected via a computer system that measures various data points constantly and will shut down the blending process at any sign of an abnormal situation.  These blending safety systems are backed up by FRA Railroad Safety procedures and car security training to maintain a safe working environment for everyone.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\n    We are very proud of our safety record.  We have not had any hazardous material releases or personal injuries.  This can only be achieved with attentive employees who care about the work they do and do it safely.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\n    Like all Andersons facilities, Winona maintains an Emergency Action Plan and procedure manual.  This is a living document that is updated and reviewed by all facility personnel.  A copy of this procedural manual is located at the facility office so that in the case of an emergency a first responder can have access to the manual.  Our local Fire Department have been on site on many occasions to review our processes as well as the anhydrous ammonia handling.   \n\n\n\nChanges to the Safety Program\n\n\n\n    The Andersons are constantly reviewing our safety program to ensure ever"
