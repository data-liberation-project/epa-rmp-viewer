White fumes will indicate the exact location of the leak.\r\n\r\nNEVER PUT WATER ON A CHLORINE LEAK. The mixture of water and Chlorine will increase the rate of corrosion of the container and make the leak larger. If Chlorine gas from a leaking container can be used in the operating system, the pressure in the container can be lowered and the leak will be less serious. If the operating system cannot use it fast enough, the Chlorine should be passed into a alkaline solution, which will absorb it. Such solutions can be made using Caustic Soda or Soda Ash mixed with water. The Chlorine should be passed into the Alkaline Solution near the bottom of the container, through iron pipe or weighted rubber hose. Either Caustic Soda or Soda Ash, along with a suitable container to hold the solution, must be kept near the Chlorine unloading areas, ready for instant use.\r\n\r\nAfter leak is controlled clean up may consist of the cleaning of all fixtures and the replacement of damaged fixtures, for corrosion con"
