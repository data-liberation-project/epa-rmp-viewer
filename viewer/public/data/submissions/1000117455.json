This includes assigning a qualified person (or position) to have overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals are to be documented, and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.  Shelly Rosen, Owner, is responsible for overall implementation of the Risk Management Program, while Ron Feehan, Facilities Manager is the Emergency Contact and has responsibilities related to the daily upkeep of the PSM / RMP."

Many areas of the warehouse are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the storage areas.\n\nMichael Lewis is a warehouse and distribution facility that runs a continuous operation. Michael Lewis utilizes a regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, for refrigeration. One closed loop refrigeration system is utilized to maintain temperature in the freezer, dock, and cooler. Michael Lewis has a total of 13,029 pounds (13,000 pounds rounded to two significant figures) of Anhydrous Ammonia onsite. \n\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A.\n\nIV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.
