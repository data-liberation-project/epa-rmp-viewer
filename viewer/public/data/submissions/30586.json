Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Yazoo City Facility located at 1205 Rialto Road, Yazoo City, MS 39194.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Yazoo City Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Yazoo City Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena has updated this RMP in response to recent changes in its management of the RMP program.  In addition, the original RMP for the Yazoo City Facility included storage of anhydrous ammonia in railcars and storage tanks on site, and included the transportation of the anhydrous ammonia via commercial vehicle.  Helena is currently in the process of discontinuing the use of the on-site storage tank and plans to have it removed by October 2004.  Helena no longer receives anhydrous ammonia via commercial vehicle.\n\nAlthough Helena has updated the RMP, Helena was not required to update the off-site consequence analysis because the containers and volumes used for the off-site consequence analysis in the original RMP did not change (i.e. 34,000-gallon railcar).  Furthermore, Helena was not required to update the potentially affected population because there has been no significant change in population or p"

Anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from a railcar and batch processed through a reactor.  The process operations conducted at this facility are performed by an independent contractor.  The independent contractor performs the batch reactor operations using a mobile pipe reactor.  The batch operations consist of unloading the anhydrous ammonia from the rail car into the reactor and mixing it with water and phosphoric acid to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer.  The contractor is responsible to OSHA for Process Safety Management compliance. Helena Chemical Company does not own or operate the formulation processes at the facility.\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for the ammonia storage process. The worst case scenario release for the Yazoo City Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released. The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 3-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (rail guards, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since check valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the severed transfer line.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk mana"
