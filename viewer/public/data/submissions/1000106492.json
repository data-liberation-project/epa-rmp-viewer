The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) measures to take for ammonia exposure (injured personnel are sent to a medical facility).  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the fire department for assistance as necessary.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nA Hazard Review has been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and this study has resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Goodman is moving forward with addressing and completing the recommendations. In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."

These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Annual inspections and tests are performed by an outside refrigeration contractor to ensure these controls are in good working order. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nA review of the facility\u0092s five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\nEmergency Response Program\nGood"

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\nGoodman is committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only the licensed refrigeration contractor is permitted to perform system operations.  Goodman has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In the event of a release, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nGoodman is located at 3163 E. Vernon Avenue in Vernon, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility\u0092s refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage of various food products.  The system uses a maximum of 23,000 pounds of ammonia.  A description of how the process operates is presented below:  \n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Condensers (C1 and C2) to the Thermosyphon Receiver (V4). The Thermosyphon Receiver provides thermosyphon oil cooling for the Compressors (CP1 \u0096 CP6). Excess liquid in the Thermosyphon Receiver is sent to the V1 Recirculator.\n\nThe V1 Recirculator pumps high temperature recirculated liquid to the V2 Recirculator and the Dock Evaporators (AU1 \u0096 AU3), Cooler Evaporators (AU4 \u0096 AU6), and the Palletizing Room Evaporators (AU23 & AU24). Liquid ammonia flowing through the evaporator coils is partially boiled as it absorbs heat from the product and room. The resulting \u0091wet suction\u0092 (liquid/vapor mix) is returned to the V1 Recirculator wherein the liquid drops to the bottom of the vessel (to be reused in the refrigeration cycle) and vapor (high stage suction) is drawn from the top by Co"
