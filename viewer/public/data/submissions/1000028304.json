The underground salt layer caverns average about 50,000 barrels capacity each.  Pipelines are used to transfer products to and from the refinery and to various product terminals.\n\n\n\nThe CHS Conway Terminal has the following EPA listed flammable substances held above the threshold quantity: propane, butane, isobutane and pentane.  Additionally, some caverns at the CHS Conway Terminal contain mixtures of flammable substances with the total amount exceeding the threshold quantity. \n\n\n\n\n\n4.0 HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe CHS Conway Terminal completed all hazard assessments required under the Risk Management Program rules.  Details of the Hazard Assessment are included in the data submitted to the U.S. EPA's Central Data Exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0 PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the CHS Conway Terminal. Because the processes at the CHS Conway Terminal are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc. 8502)\n\nThe CHS Conway Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. There is one employee representative in the position of Special Project Operator at the CHS Conway Terminal. This employee is responsible for writing and updating operating procedures, verifying P&ID drawings with engineers and interfacing between Conway operators and management. Other examples of employee participation include updating and compiling t"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program.  \n\nIn addition, the employee participation policy is maintained at the CHS Inc. Environment, Health & Safety Department located at 1391 Iron Horse Road in McPherson, Kansas.  It addresses each accident prevention program element.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc. 8503)\n\nThe CHS Conway Terminal maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to assure safe operation of the CHS Conway Terminal. These documents address inventory maximums and safe limits for pressures and flows of transfer pumps.  Up-to-date information is maintained by operation personnel at the CHS Conway Terminal.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \n\n\n\nIn addition, CHS Inc. maintains numerous mechanical documents that provide information about the design and construction of Conway Terminal equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to assure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nThis information is available through the CHS Inc. Engineering Department. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc. 8504)\n\nThe CHS Conway Terminal has a comprehensive program to help assure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

      "SummaryText": "m, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and assure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nCHS Inc. primarily uses the \"What If\" analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The \"What If\" technique asks a series of questions to review potential hazard scenarios and possible consequences.  This analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the underground storage as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the Process Hazard Coordinator for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps assure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help assure that process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, CHS Inc. periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

New employees receive basic training in underground operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \n\nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to assure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc. 8507)\n\nThe CHS Conway Terminal uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near underground storage equipment, procedures are in place to assure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules and, and inform CHS Conway Terminal personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
