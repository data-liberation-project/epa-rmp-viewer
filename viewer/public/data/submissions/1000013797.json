(Rupari) facility located at 15600 South Wentworth Avenue in South Holland, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being submitted as the five year RMP update.  This RMP includes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases.

Facility Identification\n\nThe Rupari facility is located at 15600 South Wentworth Avenue in South Holland, Illinois.  Rupari is an importer, manufacturer and distributor of quality pork. Specializing in ribs, both domestic and imported, the company sells to both retail and foodservice customers around the country. \n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311612.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for processing and distribution.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating coolers, freezers, and production areas at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia in System 1 is approximately 23,000 pounds.  System 1 is used for cooling in the storage freezer, coolers, process areas, and compressor oil cooling.  System 1 consists of three (3) high stage compressors, four (4) booster compressors, one (1) evaporative condenser, three (3) storage freezer unit evaporators, ten (10) freezer unit evaporators, four (4) cutting room evaporators, two (2) holding cooler evaporators, one (1) RTE holding cooler evaporator, two (2) shipping dock evaporators, two (2) old receiving dock evaporators, one (1) palletizing room evaporator, three (3) seasoning room evaporators, one (1) auto purger, one (1) low temperature accumulator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) high temperature accumulator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) high pressure receiver, and one (1) intercooler.\n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia in System 2 has been calculated at approximately 9,700 pounds.

Management Program\n\nRupari has updated a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This system has assigned qualified person(s) (or position) to assist in the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals will be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.  Currently, Brad Young, Plant Engineer, is responsible for implementation of the overall Risk Management Program.\n\n"
