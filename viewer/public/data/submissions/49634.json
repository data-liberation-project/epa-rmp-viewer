In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nSugar Creek Packing is located at 1241 North Gettysburg Avenue, Dayton Ohio 45427. We are a Bacon producing facility.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage. Ammonia refrigeration engine rooms and, miscellaneous utilities.\n \nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains of 26,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nSugar Creek Packing has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and, accepted by all employees at our facility.  Our facility management believes in the importance of work place safety and are empowered to enforce all of our company policies"
