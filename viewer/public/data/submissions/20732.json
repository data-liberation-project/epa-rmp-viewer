IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.2. FACILITY INFORMATION/ THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO RETAILERS. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR BLENDING INTO MIXED-GRADE FERTILIZERS FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. THE MAXIUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 408,000 POUNDS IN SIX STORAGE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A RAIL CAR HOLDING 150,000 POUNDS. THE WORSTM-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO. (A) THE WORSE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK (OR TANK CAR) RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 127,500 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200PPM) IS 1.1 MILES. (B) THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY ( OR THEW MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT) IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT ( POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .31 MILES. (4) THE ACCIDENTAL RTELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY rEQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINSTRATION (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\". (5) THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (EITHER A. OR B.)
