Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use and because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\n\nGordon Food Service is committed to maintaining a safe operations for our employees and the surrounding community.  As stated in our Gordon Food Service policy as Stated: \"The protection of human life is one of our most important objectives in the course of conducting business.  The safety of all those associated with GFS, including the general public, cannot be compromised.  It is our goal to operate in both a safe and productive manner.  ...The preservation of people, equipment, and merchandise will enable us to be a quality supplier.  ...These unwanted events can be prevented through \"know-how\" and a willingness to do our jobs in a safe manner.  These responsibilities rest with every one of us, and will be a part of our performance objectives.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, FM Global insurance standards, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  In accordance with section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 68, and OSHA 29 CRF 1910.119 this report fulfills the requirements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program for Gordon Food Service.  Gordon Food Service's priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.\n\n\n\nWe used the EPA's ammonia model ammonia refrigeration guidance documents to estimate hazard levels. We used both the ALOHA and MARPLOT software for the worst case and alternative case modeling for offsite consequences.\n\nThe facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nA copy of the Emergency plans has been reviewed and sent to the Springfield Fire Department and joint scenario training has been completed with the fir"

In the event of an offsite release the Springfield fire department will provide for warning and evacuation/shelter in place for the general public.\n\nThrough our RMP Gordon Food Service looks for continuous improvement in our ammonia refrigeration system and overall operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nGFS demonstrates their commitment to preventing releases to the environment by being actively involved with the Clark County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  GFS has developed in conjunction with the Clark County LEPC a Chemical Emergency Response Plan & Standard Operating Procedures (Emergency Response Plan) for GFS's Springfield Distribution Center.  The stated purpose of this Emergency Response Plan is:\n\n* To ensure the safety of Emergency Response Team Personnel during a hazardous materials emergency.\n\n* To provide adequate safety precautions in protecting Gordon Food Service employees and the public from harm caused by a chemical release.\n\n* To provide the Emergency Response Team with management direction during all operations directly related to a hazardous material emergency.\n\n\n\nGFS has established a strong relationship with the Springfield Fire Department to assist GFS personnel in implementing GFS's established policies and the procedures established in this Emergency Response Plan.  \n\n"
