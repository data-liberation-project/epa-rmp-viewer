The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\n\n\nThe top priority of Silver Springs Citrus is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.  In this effort, Silver Springs Citrus has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\n\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated.  Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response.  It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency and depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, Silver Springs Citrus will evacuate or shelter in place its employees and call Lake County Fire and Rescue to respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nSilver Springs Citrus is a convenience foods manufacturing facility located in Howey-In-The-Hills, Florida.  The process includes refrigerated spaces that utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS  \n\n\n\nE"

      "SummaryText": "o provide all necessary information regardless of trade secrets to ensure employee safety.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY - LAST FIVE YEARS\n\n\n\nAn over pressurization on an ammonia jacketed tank occurred on August 24, 2015 resulting in an 11 lb. release. There were no injuries and no environmental damage.  The cause of the release was identified as improper procedures and human error.  The procedures have been revised and operators have been re-trained.  \n\n\n\nThere is a record of the ammonia release incident on file as part of the facility Process Safety Management Program.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nSilver Springs Citrus is included in the written community emergency response plan.  The facility has its own emergency action plan.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release.  The emergency action plan also includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\nSilver Springs Citrus does not respond to emergencies.  Silver Springs Citrus coordinates its Emergency Action Plan with Lake County Fire and Rescue. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSilver Springs Citrus has recently performed a hazard analysis per their Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs.  Areas for improvement during the hazard analysis were identified and corrective actions recommended.  All recommendations are promptly addressed.\n\n"
