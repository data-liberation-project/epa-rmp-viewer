This adjustment aids the separation of\n\ncopper bearing material from the other components of the solution.  Sulfur dioxide is used because\n\nit is the most effective and efficient reagent for this purpose.\n\n\n\nCertain safety precautions must be observed when handling and storing sulfur dioxide to prevent\n\nhuman exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, to reduce\n\nthe hazard to nearby members of the surrounding communities, and to reduce the threat to the\n\nenvironment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, state and local rules and regulations. \n\nSafety depends upon the manner in which we handle and store the sulfur dioxide combined with the\n\nsafety devices inherent in the design of the storage vessel and surrounding process equipment plus\n\nthe adequate training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThe primary function of The Doe Run Company's mill facilities is to process the raw ore extracted\n\nfrom the ground into lead, zinc and copper concentrate.  Sulfur dioxide is only used when the copper\n\nconcentrate is being made.  Copper concentrate constitutes approximately two and one-half percent\n\nof the total concentrate production at The Doe Run Company mills.  Sulfur dioxide is delivered to\n\nthe mills via a tanker truck and stored in one tank located at the mill.  Access to the mill facilities is\n\nrestricted to authorized company employees and company management personnel.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance stored at this facility is anhydrous sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nThe maximum amount of sulfur dioxide stored at this facility at any on time is 145,396 pounds.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with all applicable Federal, state and local rules and regulations.  The facility\n\nemployees have been trained acco"

The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local\n\nfire authority and law enforcement officials, company officials, local political authorities, and the local\n\nmedia.  Employees have been instructed in the specific measures to be implemented at this facility in\n\nresponse to an incident involving sulfur dioxide.  Emergency response includes the evacuation of the\n\nwork place, if indicated, the use of self-contained breathing apparatus, and notification of appropriate\n\ncompany officials.\n\n\n\nThe Doe Run Company, SEMO, will continue to reduce the hazards associated with the use and\n\nstorage of sulfur dioxide through employee training, the use of compliance inspections and audits,\n\nmaintenance procedure reviews, equipment testing, and cooperation with our suppliers to assure the\n\nsafest operation possible.  The Doe Run Company, SEMO intends to make every effort to \"Make\n\nTomorrow Better Than Today\", whether it be in the handling of materials, protecting employee and\n\ncommunity health and safety, or protecting the environment."
