The building is isolated from other facilities and is approximately 450 feet from the nearest residence.  Operational and Maintenance Procedures that promote safe responsible operation of the chlorine storage and wastewater disinfect ion system.  Should an emergency response become necessary, it will be coordinated with the Polk County Sheriffs Office.  This will provide an organized timely response of emergency professionals to any emergency situation that endangers public safety or property.  The duties of this response team are delineated in the Monmouth Emergency Response Plan adopted in November 1995, the Polk County Fire District #1 Emergency Management Plan, adopted in October 2000, and the Polk County Emergency Management Plan, adopted in November 2000.  In the event of a Chlorine Spill, these emergency response plans provide coordinated procedures that react to the hazard and provide rapid public notification and evacuation.\n\nThis submittal is a correction to Monmouth's first RMP submittal made on June 6, 2001, which failed to include the required certification and Process 3 evaluation.  We are currently evaluating and completing the Process 3 assessment.  We expect to compete this work by September 15, 2001 and we will resubmit a revised RMP submittal at that time.  "
