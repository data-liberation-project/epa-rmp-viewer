Appendix 8B summarizes locations of referenced documents/records and lists the people responsible for maintaining that information.\n\n\n\n8.2.1  Emergency Action Plan Development\n\nFlexible Foam Products developed and revise the EAP and other procedures associated with emergency response.  The committee reviews regulatory and company requirements to (1) evaluate existing Miami Plant emergency procedures, (2) identify existing practices that need to be documented with written procedures, and (3) define new practices, procedures, and training requirements that are necessary to meet Flexible Foam\u00c2\u00bfs ERP objectives.\n\n\tFlexible Foam Products, Inc. developed the EAP to address: \n\n\t(1)\tsmall chemical releases, \n\t(2)\tsmall incipient fires that can be easily extinguished, \n\t(3)\tpersonnel injuries and illness requiring first aid or emergency medical treatment, and \n\t(4)\tweather-related emergencies.  \n\n\tThe Miami Plant does not have a fire brigade.
