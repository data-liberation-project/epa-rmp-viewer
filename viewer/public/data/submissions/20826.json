This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processing plants.\n\n     Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain and control the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n     The Clear Creek Gas Storage Facility is located approximately 12 miles northeast of the town of Evanston, Wyoming.  \n\n     The plant operates a low temperature, liquid separation process for the production of Y-Grade natural gas liquids (NGLs).  These liquids are made up of propanes, butanes, and heavier hydrocarbons.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n     The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with regulated substances in Program Level 1 processes at the plant is a catastrophic failure of the 55,000 gallon propane storage tank.  This results in a release of the entire contents of the largest tank (247,005 pounds of propane NGLs) over a ten minute period.  The resulting vapor-cloud explosion generates a 1 psig over-pressure endpoint approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the plant.  There are no public receptors, environmental receptors, or population centers within the over-pressure area.\n\n     Although CCGS has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\n     Since the facility qualifies as Pr"

      "SummaryText": "ogram Level 1, no Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was required.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n     Clear Creek Gas Storage Facility is a new site.  Start-up is anticipated during March, 2000.  As such there have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n     The Clear Creek Gas Storage Facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency response including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post-incident cleanup requirements.\n\n     In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.\n\n     Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary.\n\n     The Emergency Response Plan is updated as needed."
