In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release. \r\nProcess Description \r\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously. Multiple compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation. The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for coolers, high-pressure glycol chiller and docks.\r\nThe main liquid ammonia storage vessel is the High Pressure/Thermosyphon Receiver (+95\u00b0). It supplies high-pressure liquid ammonia for thermosyphon oil cooling of the compressors, and to the Low Pressure Recirculator (+16\u00b0).\r\nAmmonia in the Low Pressure Receiver Recirculator is maintained at a constant temperature / pressure of 16\u00b0F / 29.4 psig via the suction pressure of the High Temperature Compressors. The Low Pressure Receiver Recirculator uses pumps to transfer low-pressure liquid ammonia to e"

Air is blown across the evaporator coils with electric fans, transferring heat from the air to the liquid ammonia inside the coils, which partially vaporizes the liquid. The liquid / vapor mixture (suction) is returned to the Low Pressure Receiver Recirculator where the liquid is recycled and the vapor is drawn away by the compressors.\r\nThe ripening room glycol chiller operates differently from the other evaporator units. The ripening room glycol chiller is a Plate and Frame evaporator and is considered flooded as liquid ammonia is always maintained in the plates. A surge tank receives makeup liquid from the Low Pressure Recirculator and supplies makeup liquid as needed to the flooded plates, the resulting vapor produced in the Plates is routed through the surge drum to the Low Pressure Recirculator.\r\nThe High Stage Compressors (#1-4) draw ammonia vapor from the Low Pressure Recirculator maintaining the vessel's pressure at the suction set point. All compressors then increase the pressure of the lower pressure vapor and the resulting high-pressure discharge (hot gas) is routed to the Evaporative Condensers, where fans and sprayed water is used to discharge the latent heat from the ammonia to the atmosphere, condensing it back into a liquid. Hot gas is also used in the defrost cycle of the evaporators.\r\nEach vessel has mechanical relief valves that automatically engage during a high-pressure condition to vent high-pressure ammonia to the atmosphere.\r\nAmmonia sensors are located in the Engine Room and within each refrigerated space throughout the warehouse.\r\nEmergency Response Program \r\nC&S has developed an Ammonia Emergency Action Plan (Refrigeration Emergency Response Plan) which includes but is not limited to the following: - emergency response and evacuation procedures - safety and health considerations - notification procedures - local emergency response age"

The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for coolers, high-pressure glycol chiller and docks and uses a charge of 21,900 pounds of ammonia.  \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\nC&S Wholesale Services, Inc. (C&S) is committed to the safety of its employees and neighbors and operates the Facility as a responsible member of the community. Personnel are encouraged to continually identify methods and procedures to reduce the use of and risks associated with hazardous chemicals. This process includes protecting the community, environment, and Facility personnel by implementing technology and procedures designed to reduce the impact of any potential release of toxic chemicals. This commitment to safety is documented in the policy and compliance manuals for the Facility, which are available to all employees. \r\nRegulated Substance \r\nC&S utilizes anhydrous ammonia within a refrigeration system at the Facility. The facility uses approximately 21,900 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \r\nOff-site Release Scenarios \r\nC&S has conducted an OCA based on the EPA document titled RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines, and used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07 to estimate the distance traveled to a toxic endpoint defined by the EPA regulation. This data were then used to estimate the potential impact caused by a release from each of the regulated substances. \r\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios \r\nAs required by regulations, scenarios were considered where the entire capacity of the largest vessel for each regulated chemical at the facility was released in 10 minutes. Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies with a maximum possible impact in the event of an accidental release. In considering these releases, the most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used. Passive mitigation measures were taken i"

Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios. \r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Prevention Steps \r\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP, elements of the prevention programs have been developed to manage process safety issues associated with the facility. Each of the program elements has been developed according to OSHA and EPA regulations in order to ensure safe operating practices and conditions at the C&S facility. Elements of Prevention Program 3 include the following: \r\n-\tProcess Safety Information - information regarding the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process description, and equipment properties \r\n-\tProcess Hazard Analysis - a detailed review of the process, and recommendations to improve the safety of the systems at the Facility \r\n-\tOperating Procedures - procedures designed to comply with regulations and provide safe practices for the systems at the Facility \r\n-\tTraining - procedures and logs for personnel training on the covered process \r\n-\tMechanical Integrity - manufacturer recommended maintenance procedures, schedules, and documentation \r\n-\tManagement of Change - documentation and tracking of changes that effect the process involving the regulated chemical \r\n-\tPre-Startup Review - prior to the star"
