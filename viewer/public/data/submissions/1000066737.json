Provides the control operator with visual and aural indication of deviation from normal operation, with sufficient time provided to respond with corrective actions.\n\n2. Aspen process historian system ? Provides continuous visual graphics representing plant performance and stability for identifying process upsets before they happen, assist with problem troubleshooting, and recovery from a process upset.\n\n3. Fail-safe engineered systems (Hardware and software interlocks, fail-safe valves)\n\n4. Validation of process operators ? Ensures that operators are trained on a specific job before being asked to perform it.\n\n5. Training of process operators ? Ensures that operators understand the objectives, procedures and risks associated with general and area-specific tasks and responsibilities.\n\n6. Standard operating procedures ? Safe operating procedures for routine, and emergency tasks\n\n7. Standard operating procedures ? Safe operating envelope for plant controls defined by technical, and troubleshooting guide.\n\n8. Management of change standard ? Rigorous review of changes prior to field implementation\n\n9. Project excellence standard ? Plan capital projects to eliminate process vulnerabilities and improve production capabilities.\n\n10. Root cause investigations ? Understand the cause of failures and leaks and develop plan to prevent recurrence.\n\n11. Daily operator rounds ? Early detection of defects and malfunctions to minimize consequence\n\n12. Process Hazard Review (Basis of safety) ? Understand the process hazards, consequences, likelihood and mitigation.\n\n13. Asset Integrity Program (AIP) ? Understand the integrity of the equipment and plan repairs\n\n14. Routine 2-year overhaul frequency\n\n15. Water Management system- insures that no contaminated, Hi, or Low pH water leaves the            unit.  \n\n16. Emergency drills/practice ? Ensures that in the event of an emergency situation the operators know how to respond, or be able to quickly look up the procedure.\n\n17. Emergency response team and training ? Ensures that there are people on-site capable of responding to most types of incidents.\n\n",
