      "SummaryText": "The Gibson Gas Plant (\"Gibson Plant\" or \"Facility\") utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \"regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\" in the processing of natural gas, where natural gas liquids (NGL) are extracted from the inlet gas using cryogenic process and being delivered to the pipeline for further market distribution. This Facility may be subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requires codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Gibson Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor for the period of five (5) years prior to June 2018. In addition, the estimated flammable endpoint for a worst-case release is less than the distance to any public or environmental receptor. Furthermore, emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the Facility and local emergency planning and response organizations. Therefore, the Gibson Plant is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nThe Gibson Plant employs three (3) full-time employees on-site who ensures the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted an RMP 5-years update to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in June 2013 for the Gibson Plant. The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink. In addition, the worst-case scenario is updated. Amine Contactor volume (966 gallons) used in June 2013 RMP is removed from Gibson Plant. The current RMP is based on liquid-full Cold Separator PV-6 (FS-151; 4"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contain in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutene, N-butane, isopentane and N-pentane. The maximum inventory of natural gas liquids (RMP-regulated flammable) at the Facility at any given time is 5,240 lbs plus flammable gas of 4,737 lbs; total flammable fluid of 9,977 lbs. In addition, Gibson Plant has two condensate storage tanks (210 bbl each). The total quantity exceeds threshold quantity of a regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds).\n\nGibson Plant representatives have reviewed all chemicals used and/or stored at the Facility and determined that there are no RMP regulated toxics present above RMP threshold quantities.\n\n\n\n1.3     68.155(d) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nBecause the Facility is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68. However, the Facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. The Gibson Plant's PSM Plan is kept on-site as a separate document. \n\n\n\n1.4 68.155(e) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Gibson Plant has had "

However, the Facility does maintain a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Terreborne Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the East Gibson Volunteer Fire Department. The East Gibson Volunteer Fire Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL release\n\nA site map, MSDSs and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility, along with their PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.\n\n\n\n1.6 68.155(g) Safety Improvements\n\nMaintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety.
