      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Crown Metro Chemicals  are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturing.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  The substance is Sulfur trioxide.  Sulfur trioxide is used as a chemical raw material in the manufacture of Reservol, a non-hazardous, non-regulated substance.                                       .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Sulfur trioxide that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational  requirements is 35650.66 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario is described in the next paragraphs.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Reservol Sulfonation.  In this scenario 10000 lb. of Sulfur trioxide is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 242.96 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 50% of the maximu"

These mitigation systems have the effect of containing any spill and reducing the rate of evaporation.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 3.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.010 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur trioxide involves a release from Reservol Sulfonation.  The scenario involves the release of 5000 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10.88 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of containing any spill and reducing the rate of evaporation.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.010 mg/L of Sulfur trioxide is 2.7 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCrown Metro Chemicals  maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined) and HAZOP.  The studies"
