In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nDescription of Ammonia Refrigeration Process\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses roughly 13,600 pounds of ammonia for process areas and warehouse cold storage.  The majority of the system is located in and outside the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condenser is mounted on steel outside the engine room, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/process areas.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid a"

The liquid ammonia expands as it enters the various evaporator coils, reducing the temperature.  These evaporators are used to maintain low air temperatures for warehouse/dock storage.  As the air is chilled by the evaporators, the ammonia is vaporized and returned to the suction accumulator.\n\n\n\nThe compressors pull the low pressure ammonia vapor from the pump receivers where it is compressed into a high pressure vapor.  This vapor is then piped to the condenser, where the ammonia is converted back to high pressure liquid and recycled to the Pilot Receiver.  The auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the PR and the condensers.  \n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo prevent accidental release of ammonia, Bridgford Foods complies with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, EPA RM Program regulations in 40 CFR Part 68, ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBecause this facility is new, there is no 5-year accident history.\n\n\n\nDescription of Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nThis facility's emergency action plan is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency action plan. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency action plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and the fire department. \n\n"
