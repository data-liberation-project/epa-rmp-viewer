About 326 employees are currently employed.  Cows and bulls are purchased over a wide area of the mid-west, harvested, chilled, deboned, packaged, stored, and distributed throughout the world.  It is a subsidiary of American Foods Group LLC and has been in business since 1989.  American Foods Group LLC has a strong commitment, starting from senior management and trickle down effect to every employee, to safety and environmental issues that affect the meat industry.  Signed safety and environmental policies by the CEO are prominently displayed in the facility.\r\n\r\nSince Dakota Premium Foods handles a perishable meat product it must be maintained under rigid temperature controls ranging from 50 degrees F. to minus 30 degrees F.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system to accomplish this.  This chemical has excellent properties of removing heat from the atmosphere and is widely used by the meat industry.  It is a gas under normal atmospheric conditions and a liquid when stored under pressure.  About 14,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is currently used in the refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system is designed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and is in compliance with State codes. Environmental Protection Agency defines anhydrous ammonia as an extremely hazardous substance.    \r\n\r\nSince we store over 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia Dakota Premium Foods has developed a Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management Program.  The PSM plan  includes 14 elements.  They are (1) employee participation (2) process safety information (3) process hazard analysis (4) operating procedures (5) training (6) contractors (7) pre-startup safety review (8) mechanical integrity (9) hot work permits (10) management of change (11) incident"

Process Safety Management meetings are held monthly to discuss progress of the 14 elements of the Process Safety Management Program.  All employees are encouraged to participate and offer suggestions to improve the program. \r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis has been conducted.  The PHA addressed: (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequences of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The recommendations are being implemented on a timely basis.  A Process Hazard Analysis is scheduled every five years. Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOP's include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  SOP's are reviewed annually and updated when necessary.  Preventive maintenance checks are conducted daily evaluating pressures, temperatures, vibrations, leaks, belts, odors, soundness of equipment, and unusual noises.  Records are kept of the findings. If a release should occur of more than 100 pounds the National Response Center is called immediately as is the Minnesota Duty Officer.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n A well trained team is on the premises to handle any leaks or emergency situations.  They have been trained in the 24 Hour Emergency Response Program and have annual refresher training classes. An emergency hazmat trailer is parked on the premises and includes self containing breathing apparatus, Level A chemical suits, first aid kit, gloves, and de-contamination equipment.  Dakota Premium Foods have members trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, automatic external defibrillation, and first aid. An automatic external def"

The fire department is aware of our hazards, is familiar with facility layout, and is ready to assist when needed.  The plan includes notifying the area neighborhood knocking door to door or by radio if an evacuation is essential, depending on severity.  An annual evacuation drill is performed for employees to keep them acquainted of routes of exit and safe refuge gathering places.  Member employees have been designated Safe Refuge Wardens to coordinate evacuation and accountability of employees.  \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site deaths, injury, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage."
