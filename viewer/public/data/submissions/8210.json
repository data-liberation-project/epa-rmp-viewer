      "SummaryText": "The Risk Management Program implemented at the City of Griffin's Potato Creek Water Pollution Control Plant integrates technologies, procedures and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and to minimize the risk of an accidental chlorine release.  The plan addresses procedures and steps to provide employee safety, public health and response agency interaction. The plan is summarized in a manual, which is maintained on site. The manual not only contains information relating to the safe handling of chlorine and emergency response actions, but also provides the framework for maintaining and operating chlorination equipment, conducting training programs, and completing incident investigations and compliance audits.\nThe Risk Management Program includes the following elements:\nAccessible chlorine safety information\nWritten operating procedures\nWritten maintenance, inspection and cleaning procedures\nOperator training\nChlorination safety equipment (leak detector)\nSafe design of chlorination system\nHazard review of equipment and procedures\nCompliance auditing\nEmergency response coordination\nThe Potato Creek Water Pollution Control Plant utilizes chlorine to provide effluent disinfection.  The facility maintains an inventory of 4,000 pounds of chlorine in two one-ton containers.  The chlorination system consists of container-mounted regulators, chlorinators, automatic switchover unit, injectors and a leak detector and alarm. Since the piping from the injectors to the regulators is under vacuum, any failure in the piping system would break the vacuum thereby limiting any potential release.  Because the regulators are mounted directly on the ton containers, nearly all of the chlorination piping is protected this way.\nThe worst case scenario involves failure of a one-ton container yielding a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a ten minute time period.  Based on this release, a wind speed of 1.5 m/s, and an atmospheric stability class F, the distance to "

      "SummaryText": "the toxic endpoint was calculated as 1.3 miles.  Public receptors include residences.  No environmental receptors were located.\nThe alternative case scenario involves failure of a one-ton container yielding a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a ten minute time period.  The alternative scenario utilized a wind speed of 3 m/s and an atmospheric stability class of D.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated as 0.3 miles.  Public receptors include residences.  No environmental receptors were located.\nIn support of the probability that a worst case accidental release will not occur, a review of the process history indicates that no reportable accidental releases have occurred within the past five years.\nThe facility's emergency response plan is coordinated through the Griffin Fire Department."
