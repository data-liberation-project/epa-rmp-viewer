New process added to more accurately report total rail car inventory. Process is managed by the Latex Manufacturing Facility and has the same Accidental Release Prevention Plan and Emergency Response Plan.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Dow Chemical Company, Dalton, GA Site is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our well-trained personnel will take actions to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with The Whitfield County Fire and Sheriff Departments, both of whom we rely upon for additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Dow Dalton facility manufactures latex, and Styrofoam??A? extruded polystyrene board. This facility is located at 1468 Prosser Drive, S.E., approximately 10 miles south of the town of Dalton, GA. The facility as 2 manufacturing plants on site, one for the production of latex which is shipped off-site for use in the paper and carpet industries, and one for the Styrofoam??A? board which is "

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68. A number of processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The facility has an air operating permit ID under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The facility received OSHA Voluntary Protection Program STAR Certification in 1997 and has maintained this certification status. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\n\na. Process Safety Information ??A? The Dalton Facility maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nb. Process Hazard Analysis ??A? The Dalton Facility has an active Process Hazard Analysis program to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards of the processes. Plant management is also responsible for the documentation and follow-up of action items from these reviews.  The Dow Environmental, Health, and Safety (EH&S) requirements specify that risk assessment or analysis be used to evaluate hazard potentials of all installations. Dow Hazard Analysis programs were instituted and operational prior to the issue of RMP. In particular, the programs listed below constitute the Dow interpretation of a Process Hazard Analysis:\ni.    Reactive Chemical Review\nii.    Fire & Explosion Index (F&EI)"

Operating Procedures ??A? For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the Dalton facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The procedures also include among other things, consequences of deviating from the procedure, steps required to avoid deviation, hazards, etc. The information is regularly reviewed, certified to be current and accurate, and readily accessible to all personnel involved in the process.\n\nd. Training ??A? The Dalton facility has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees who are operating processes or newly assigned to the process are trained in an overview of the process and are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\ne. Mechanical Integrity ??A? The Dalton facility carries out a highly documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. The facility follows The Dow Chemical Company Global Mechanical Integrity Safety Standard (GMISS) which details testing, inspection, and repair requirements. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, control, and pumps and compressors. Maintenance and installation activities are carried out by qualified personnel. Any equipment deficiencies identified by these tests and/or inspections are corrected in"
