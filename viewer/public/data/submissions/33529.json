The executive summary identifies hazards associated with operation of Transbas Inc. and describes practices in place to mitigate those hazards.  This information is available to local emergency respose groups.  It is also available to the public in limited form.  This document also provides for control of other information required to be submitted in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThis document should be reviewed for required changes whenever the RMPlan is updated.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nDepartment of Labor (OSHA), 29 CFR part 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, February 24, 1992\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule, 40 CFR part 68, Final Rule, June 20, 1996\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nHow Coverage was Determined for Transbas\n\nDimethylamine and isopropylamine are both listed in the RMP rule and are stored above the threshold\nquantity at Transbas. EPA's lookup tables were used in modeling the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nStationary Source Description and Use of RMP Regulated Substances\n\nTransbas, Inc. (Transbas) is located in Section 26, Township 1 North, Range 26 East in Yellowstone County, Montana and encompasses approximately 27 acres.  Transbas is a subdivision of United Agri Products (UAP), which is a subsidiary of ConAgra, Inc.  Transbas operates a herbicide formulation facility which blends and reacts raw phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicides with alcohols, solvents, amines or water to produce finished products.   \n\nDimethylamine(DMA) and isopropylamine(IPA) are used to produce herbicides through the amination of phenoxy acids.  The DMA amination process consists of a 60% aqueous solution of DMA along with a bulk phenoxy acid solid in a batch process creating a liquid finished herbicide.    IPA in a 50% aqueou"

Although controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the worst-case flammable endpoint is 0.422 miles (2228 feet).   \n\nThe real life preventative measures which are not considered in the WCS evaluation, are as follows  :\n                                *   Engineering approved materials of construction for 50% IPA storage\n                                *   Nitrogen purge preventing IPA vapor release to atmospere and eliminating static air\n                                     in the tank\n                                *   Safety relief device on the 50% IPA storage tank\n                                *   Maintenance and inspection programs to monitor equipment integrity\n                                *   In-house operating and startup procedures\n                                *   Operator observation for quick response\n                                *   Inventory minimization during non-IPA production periods which is the majority of\n                                     the year\n                                *   Purchasing material which minimizes IPA in processes and reduces IPA inventory on                 \n                                    site\nWith these practices in place, Transbas considers the complete release of a full 50% IPA storage tank to be a low probability.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO (ARS)\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for a flammable substance at Transbas is the rupture of a gasket on the 60% D"

Processes regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements applicable to RMP and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The administrative procedures used for process safety management have been revised to incorporate all RMP required items and these procedures are now considered PSM/RMP administrative procedures.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nTransbas encourages employees to participate in plant safety.  PSM/RMP elements include employee participation through writing and updating operating and maintenance procedures, compiling process safety information and participating in process hazard analysis'. Additionally, employee's have been instructed to come forward with their safety concerns.  Process' that fall under RMP requirements already are subject to PSM requirements.  Programs are in place that address both PSM and RMP regulations.  All PSM/RMP materials are available to employees.   \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION"

References\nAdditionally, complete files on PSM/RMP covered equipment are located in mechanical integrity documentation.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nTransbas has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various units within our process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe techniques Transbas uses in its PHAs are the \"What-if Checklist\"  and hazard and operability study (HAZOP) analysis for specific nodes.  The HAZOP technique is one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  All PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and makes recommendations for additional prevention and safety measures or design changes when the team believes such actions are necessary.\n\nLocal management reviews the PHA Team recommendations, and employees are assigned accountability to resolve all recommendations that have been made by the PHA team and accepted by local management.  Implementation of recommendations in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA Team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios are assigned the highest risk ranking and thus receive immediate attention.  All approved recommendations being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  Upon competion of all recommendations for a specific PHA, a final report is issued that all affected employees can access, thus having knowledge that all the recommendations for the P"

Additional details, including management responsibilities, can be found in the refinery Process Hazard Anaysis, (PSM-ADM-04) procedure.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nTransbas maintains written operating procedures for normal operations and emergency procedures.  Startup and shutdown procedures are included in the normal operating procedures since we produce in batches.  Emergency procedures include the assignment of responsibility of shutdown and startup procedures.  Included in the operating procedures is guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process steps or equipment parameter deviations.\n\nThese procedures are used by operators and are used in the training of new operators.  All procedures are reviewed at least annually by the area supervisor.  Whenever a change is required the management of change procedure is initiated.  Operating procedures are readily available to the operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.  \n\nAdditional information, including management responsibilities can be found in PSM-ADM-05 of the PSM administrative procedure.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Transbas has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  When new operators can demonstrate through tests or skills demonstration that they have the knowledge necessary to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they may be qualified for a job position and allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators are updated when ever a process change occurs and are periodically given refres"
