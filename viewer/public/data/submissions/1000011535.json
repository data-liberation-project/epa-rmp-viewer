This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at out facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.0\tCherokee Nitrogen Company and Regulated Substances\nOur facility\u00c2\u00bfs primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes.  Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins.  Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world, and is commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods.\n\nThe company is a supplier to the fertilizer, explosives, and commercial industries by manufacturing ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other products.   Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers.\n\nWe have four regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include anhydrous ammonia, ammonia solutions (> 20%), chlorine, and sulfur dioxide.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent).  Aqueous ammonia is contained within the urea and ammonium nitrate solutions.  Chlorine is used to treat the incoming process water prior to use by the facility.  Sulfur dioxide is used to treat the outgoing process water prior to discharge from the facility.\n\nTypically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions:  industrial \u00c2\u00bf grade (83 weight percent) ammonium nitrate solution, and a high pressure solution"

The industrial grade ammonium nitrate is used as a primary building block for commercial explosives and blasting agents.  Without this product, the mining of precious metals and gems, coal for power and concrete for construction would be much less safe and much more expensive. \n\nAs this RMP will illustrate, our accidental release prevention programs and our emergency response planning efforts help us effectively manage any potential hazards posed by these regulated substances.\n\n3.0\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME, Section 8, 1955 and 1979 editions.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at out stationary source.\n\n3.1\tProcess Safety Information\nCherokee Nitrogen maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n3.2\tProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are indentified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analysis is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 2/4/09.\n\t\n3.3\tOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cherokee Nitrogen maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, t"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n3.4\tTraining\nCherokee Nitrogen has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n3.5\tMechanical Integrity\nCherokee Nitrogen carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\t\nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n3.6\tManagement of Change \nWritten procedures are in place at Cherokee Nitrogen to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of Management of Change procedures was performed on 2/20/09.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal wit4h the modification.\n\n3.7\tPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Cherokee Nitrogen.  The most recent review was performed on 4/27/09.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into opera"

The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 8/18/09.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n3.9\tIncident Investigation\nCherokee Nitrogen promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are under taken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n3.10\tEmployee Participation\nCherokee Nitrogen truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00c2\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis in particular.\n\n3.11\tContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.
