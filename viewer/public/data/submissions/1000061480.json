The processes at this gas plant which are\n\nregulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Lobo II Natural Gas Processing Plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include individual and team efforts to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. They perform such activities as pre-startup safety reviews and participate in the development and review of operating procedures, piping and instrument diagrams and other process safety information (PSI), as well as training and mentoring of other personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Lobo II Natural Gas Processing Plant develops and maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain sa"

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any\n\nnecessary process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Lobo II Natural Gas Processing Plant primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The HAZOP analysis methodology is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of Enlink Midstream personnel and/or Contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise with this covered process. This PHA Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA Team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions. Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks-as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management. This risk reduction ranking helps to ensure that potential accident scenarios, especially those assigned to the highest hazard risk, receive immediate attention. All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are tracked until assigned action items/tasks are completed in a timely manner. The final resolution of each finding is documented, dated, and retained.

      "SummaryText": " Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Lobo II Natural Gas Processing Plant conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process\n\nsafety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting\n\nsystems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a\n\nquality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Lobo II Natural Gas Processing Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and\n\ncompressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written\n\nprocedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for"

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Lobo II Natural Gas Processing Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by\n\nthe findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Lobo II Natural Gas Processing Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine\n\nwhether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are required at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in\n\nresponse to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and th"

The program consists of procedures for safely responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency action response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a flammable release occurs. Company personnel are also available to assess post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address\n\nmaintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency action response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency action program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or lessons learned from other Enlink Midstream gas plant facilities. The overall emergency action program for the Lobo II Natural Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Loving County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.
