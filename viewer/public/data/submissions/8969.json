In the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the Denison, Iowa Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  2) Description of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled - This facility is a collection site for animal plasma.  We process and dry liquid plasma.  We use ammonia to aid on the mechanical side of the spray-dried process.  The process consists of a 1000 gallon ammonia tank and piping, valves and compressors.  3) Worst Case Release Scenario - Our worst case scenario is failure of the tank when filled to the maximum capacity allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the EPA look-up tables, the distance to end point is 0.4 miles.  The affected population is 4 people.  4) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps - This facility complies with EPA's accidental prevention rule and all applicable stat and local regulations and codes.  This ammonia system was designed and installed and maintained according to all state and local regulations.  5) 5-Year Accident History - There have been no accidents involving ammonia that have caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation or shelters in place.  6) Emergency Response Program - In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Denison, Iowa Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Fire Department and members of the department have inspected our system.  7) Planned Safety Improvement Changes - None."
