In the event of a release, we are prepared to work with the local fire department and minimize the impact of the release on the employees, local residents, and the environment of the area.\n\n\n\nAg Service is an Ag wholesale business that sells fertilizers to dealers for resale for crop production by farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is utilized in the plant to be combined with water for the production of aqua ammonia of ~ 30% concentration.  Both the anhydrous storage and the aqua ammonia production/storage are covered under the RMP.  The level of RMP for the anhydrous ammonia is upgraded to a level 3 from a level 2 because it is no longer used to produce mixed fertilizers in a batch mixer (OSHA exemption).  The level of RMP for the aqua ammonia is upgraded to a level 3 from a level 2 because the product concentration is currently above 20%.\n\n\n\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at our facility is 53,000 lbs., or approximately 12,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia. The maximum amount unloaded or present at our facility at any one time would be 53,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nAg Services, Inc. also has a maximum of 139,000 lbs of Aqueous Ammonia present at any one time.  The concentration ranges from ~20% to 29%.\n\n\n\nA combination of these two materials yields a maximum quantity of ammonia on site at any one time of 94700 pounds (separate containers and not interconnected).  \n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the entire storage tank in a gas release over 10 minutes.  The amount released would be 53,000 pounds and would result in an end point of 3.4 miles and would effect a population of 3100.   The RMP Comp model was used for the end point calculations.\n\n\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia would be a pipe release over 10 minutes.  T"

The RMP Comp model was used for the end point calculations.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario for Aqueous Ammonia would be the release of the entire storage tank into the diked area. a liquid that is contained and slowly turns to a vapor release over an extended time period.  The amount released would be 139,000 pounds and would result in an end point of 0.8 miles and would effect a population of 10.   The RMP Comp model was used for the end point calculations.\n\n\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for the Aqueous Ammonia would be a liquid release from a pipe leak over 30 minutes.  The total amount released would be 1200 pounds and would result in an endpoint of 0.1 miles and would effect a population of 0.  The RMP model was used for the end point calculations.\n\n\n\nThe affected population was estimated using the 2000 census data for the City of Hillsboro (2926) and the and population density per square mile for Marion County of 14.\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program: The facility has complied with the Kansas Department of Agriculture?s Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and are inspected every year.  The plant has also done it's best to comply with the ANSI K-61 published by the American National Standards Institute and the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s Ammonia regulation, 29 CFR 1910.111.\n\n\n\nThe 5-year Accident History: There has not been a reportable accident in the past 5 years\n\n\n\nWe have implemented and have posted at our main office and in the aqua ammonia control room, our emergency action plan for handling of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia. These guidelines include limited first responder actions in case of fire, spills or leaks, and first aid. Employees have been trained in regards to all of these emergencies and have been instructed to handle only what they judge to be c"

Their prime responsibility is to alert the proper authorities and move everyone to a safe location.  \n\n\n\nAg Service Inc. has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standards. We also have provided the Hillsboro Fire Department and the Marion County Emergency Planning Commission with our community right to know information as required by SARA Title III.\n\n\n\nSafety is a top priority at our facility. We will continue to make periodic inspections and evaluations on the safety of our anhydrous and aqua ammonia facilities."
