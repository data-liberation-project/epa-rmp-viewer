This System uses a Heat Exchanger to begin to cool the incoming Gas ( the cooling side of the exchanger is cold gas from the cold liquid separator). The Natural Gas leaves the Heat Exchanger and travels to the J T Valve ( the jt valve is designed to drop the incoming gas pressure 800 to1000 psig to 650 psig). The pressure drop across the JT Valve causes a cooling effect of 7 Degrees per 100 psig pressure. The Cool Gas then travels to the Cold Separator where the heavy Liquids  C-3 Plus are collected and sent to a 30,000 Gallon Storage vessal. The Natural Gas returns out the top of theSeperator to the Heat Exchanger where it is heated up and then to Sell Pipeline.",

      "SummaryText": "The Victory Compressor Station is located in Marshall County, W.Va. 12 miles south of the town of Cameron. The Facility is a Dewpoint Control Facility designed to strip C-3 plus (Propanes Plus) from the Natural Gas Stream. The Compressor is used when the Flowing Well Pressure drops below 850 psig. The Natural Gas flows from the well to the Facility via pipelines. The Natural Gas then flows through a Triethylene Glycol Dehydrater to remove excess water from the gas stream. The Gas then flows a Heat Exchanger where the cooling of the gas begins, the Gas is cooled to approx. 50 degrees in the exchanger. The gas then goes through the J T Valve which is designed to drop the temperature 7 degrees per 100 lb. pressure (850psig to 600psig) the gas is now 30 degrees and flows into a Cold Separator. The Separator is 36 inches in diameter. The rapid expansion of the Cold Gas causes the Propanes Plus to drop out of the Gas Stream and the Liquid fall to the bottom of the Separator and sent to LPG Storage Tank, 30,000 gal. The LPG is then transported by to truck to a Gatherning Facility for farther separation. The Gas then leaves the top of the separator, then through the heat exchanger to the Sell Meter and Pipeline.

This gives a distance endpoint of 1 psi to .5 miles of a Gas Vapor Detonation. There are two (2) homes in this area. A pull away explosion caused by a driver failing to disconnect from the load out facility and seperating the hose would result in a 17 lb. of LPG released. This would cause a Vap"
