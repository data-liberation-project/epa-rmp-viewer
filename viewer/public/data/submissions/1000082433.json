By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Kenova LP Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Butane Batch Blending Process.\r\n\r\nButane Batch Blending is a batch type process based on seasonal RVP adjustments. Butane is received by truck (transports), stored on-site, and piped directly to injection points feeding the dock and off-site locations. Process safety controls include Smart-hoses, low emission couplers, emergency shutoff valves throughout (manual, automated and thermally actuated), vessel PRVs, excess flow valves, hydrostatic pressure relief, and process area hydrocarbon detectors along with on-site fire water monitors. Access to the Kenova LP Terminal and butane offload/storage area is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nB.
