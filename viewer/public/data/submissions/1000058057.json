Sioux-Preme senior management is committed to safety and specifically to implementation of this RMP/PSM program.\n\n\n\nThe Sioux-Preme facility is subject to OSHAA?s PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) and emergency action plan (29 CFR 1910.38) requirements, and to EPAA?s RMP (40 CFR 68) requirements.  It is Sioux-PremeA?s goal to comply with these regulations and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  It is Sioux-PremeA?s intent to use this program to verify that the anhydrous ammonia system has been designed, installed, and will be maintained in general accordance with relevant codes and standards.  The RMP/PSM program developed for the facility is currently in the initial stages of implementation.\n\n\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nSioux-Preme Packing Company (Sioux-Preme) is located in a rural setting south of Sioux Center, Iowa, and uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their pork slaughtering/processing operation.  As of the implementation of this plan, Sioux-Preme is subject to the PSM/RMP regulations because it stores/uses ammonia in quantities above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for process refrigeration.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nSioux-PremeA?s release prevention program consists of periodic training of personnel responsible for operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system; regular maintenance inspections to identify potential threats to the integrity of the system (such as corrosion, malfunctioning gauges, or damage to valves or piping) and to identify areas for improvement; periodic compliance audits to ensure that the program is being properly implemented, that regulations are being followed, and that prevention procedures are being reevaluated and improved upon; use of managem"

Sioux-Preme has discussed this procedure with the fire department; members of the fire department have visited the Sioux-Preme Sioux Center facility.\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of this RMP/PSM program, all facility personnel will be trained in procedures to be followed during an emergency involving release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  Initial training will be conducted in the summer/early fall of 2006.  The level of training will be commensurate with the degree of responsibility assigned to various employees, e.g., general workers will be trained on the hazards associated with ammonia and will be trained in proper facility evacuation procedures, while maintenance workers, in addition to training related to refrigeration system maintenance, will receive training related to emergency shutdown procedures, release mitigation procedures, and related response actions.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nThe facility completed an environmental compliance audit in May 2006.  The audit revealed that the facility is subject to the both EPA RMP requirements and OSHA PSM regulation (29 CFR 1910.119), and a RMP/PSM program has been developed for the facility.  As part of the implementation of this program, the facility will be conducting awareness training for all employees, training for employees who will be involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia ref"
