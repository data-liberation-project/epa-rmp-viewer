The Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place,  property damage or enviromental damage.\n\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency response plan that addresses procedures to inform the public and response agencies, indicates first aid and necessary emergency medical treatment, plus operational procedures to be taken in the event of an accdental release of ammonia.  Our emergency response plan has been reviewed with local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.\nPeriodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.\nThere are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at \nthis  time."

The Facility Policy:  The management and employees of Perry Feed and Fertilizer,Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 84,117 pounds in the facility's one storage tank.  The capacity of the storage tank is 18,000 gallons.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,117 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 2.23 miles.\n\n\n   The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose, with 13,319 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 1.56 miles.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture"
