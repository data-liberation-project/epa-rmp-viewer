The primary products produced are anhydride curing agents for epoxy resins. These curing agents are used to manufacture composite materials, electrical and electronic components, and many other products. Other products manufactured include coating resins used in concrete and masonry paints, special polymers, and additives for the curing agent products.\n\n\n\nThe risk management regulations apply because of two flammable substances handled onsite, 1,3-butadiene and isoprene. Both of these materials are essential raw materials for Lindau products and both have been used in our process for over 50 years without serious incident. This risk management plan (RMP) covers the storage and use of these two materials at Lindau. Both of these materials are flammable and that is the basis for their listings in the risk management regulations. Isoprene is used in greater quantities and so a larger amount of isoprene is generally onsite. Both materials are stored in tanks and delivered by rail car or tanker truck. Other materials used at Lindau are either not listed in the risk management regulations or are present in quantities below threshold amounts.\n\n\n\nLindau Chemicals, Inc. is committed to operating its facilities and processes in a manner that protects the safety of our neighbors, the community, the environment and our employees. We have effective safety, environmental and emergency programs incorporating policies and procedures maintained to teach safety, correct deficiencies, provide a safe working environment, minimize waste materials, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. All company supervisors, managers, and officers are responsible for the enforcement of safety and environmental policies and practices.\n\n\n\nLindau Chemicals has a thorough Process Safety Management Program to help prevent accidental releases and fir"

      "SummaryText": "es. The program details our procedures for analyzing process hazards and implementing improvements to processes. The program includes procedures for safety analyses of processes, called Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). PHAs have been performed that cover the use and storage of all process materials, including 1,3-butadiene and isoprene, and all PHAs are re-validated on a periodic basis. Potential releases and accidents have been identified through the PHAs and the safeguards used to prevent accidents have been evaluated. We also have a comprehensive Fire Prevention Plan to control ignition sources in areas where flammable materials are used or stored. \n\n\n\nThe safety management program also includes a mechanical integrity program for all process equipment including the storage tanks, piping, pumps and transfer hoses. Included in this program is a testing procedure to inspect and test equipment used for processing isoprene or 1,3-butadiene on a regular basis. These procedures are recognized as good industry practices and we believe are effective in preventing accidents. \n\n\n\nDuring the past five years there have been no incidents involving any risk management regulated materials that meet the reporting requirements of 40 CFR 68.42. Lindau Chemicals has never had any incidents involving either 1,3-butadiene or isoprene that caused property damage, injuries or evacuations off site. \n\n\n\nLindau Chemicals, Inc. has a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan which details response procedures to spills, fires and other emergencies. We maintain a relationship between Lindau's management and the Columbia Fire Department. Firefighters have periodically visited Lindau's facility to become and remain familiar with the layout and materials present. Lindau employees are trained regularly on evacuation, emergency response and notification procedures.
