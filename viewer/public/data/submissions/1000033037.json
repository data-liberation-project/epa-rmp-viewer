      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\nThe Praxair Distribution facility at Indianapolis, Indiana is an industrial and specialty gas plant that manufactures, stores and handles substances that are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \r\n\r\n- Acetylene, as part of a production and distribution process\r\n- Propylene, as a redistribution (transfill) operation\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\r\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\r\n\r\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible CareA&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Indianapolis facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\r\n-\tTechnical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\r\n-\tProcedures and programs to develop"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\r\n\r\nThe acetylene production area is equipped with a deluge system which can be operated manually or passively. The facility also employs plant emergency trip stations so that in the event of an emergency all plant processes will be halted.\r\n\r\nThe propylene system is equipped with an emergency shutoff switch which when  activated closes the tanks main isolation valves.  The propylene production area also incorporates the use of the plant emergency trip station.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nThe Indianapolis facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical processes over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Programs\r\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.

      "SummaryText": "be a non-responding facility as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), i.e. Praxair employees will respond to minor incidents.\r\n\r\nFor other than minor incidents Praxair has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with the Marion County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Speedway and Indianapolis Fire departments. Each agency has a listing of the hazardous materials at this facility and a facility map identifying the production and storage areas for these materials. \r\n\r\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nPraxair has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of Zero/Zero, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\r\n\r\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvement that have reached the planning stage."
