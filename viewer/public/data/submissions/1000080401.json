As a disinfectant, SPRWS uses chlorine and ammonia.  Both chemicals exceed the threshold quantities established by the EPA in the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r).  Therefore, SPRWS first completed a risk management plan (RMP) in June of 1999 and continues to update the plan with this document.\n\n\n\nSPRWS trains our operators in safe handling of the chemicals and in running drills with the Saint Paul Fire Department, Maplewood Fire Department, and Maplewood Police. These drills simulate our response in the event of an uncontrollable leak on one of these systems. (Note that an uncontrolled leak would occur only when our emergency shutdown mechanisms failed to control 100% of any leak, which would be extremely rare.) SPRWS has developed a Continuity of Operations Plan, Emergency Action Plan, Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Plan, and Railcar Security Plan in conjunction with the Emergency Response Plan for Chlorine and Ammonia. \n\n\n\nThough our chlorine/ ammonia facility went on-line in 1999 and was state-of-the-art at the time, SPRWS has made safety improvements to both systems since then. Automatic railcar valve closers were added in 2007 to further limit any potential releases. Previously, a section of piping was not protected by this automatic valve closing system, and this represented a potential risk to SPRWS. The additional automatic valves were added, and now the entire piping system beyond the railcar is protected. Access control has also been added since the original construction. Cameras, motion detectors, climb resistant fencing, and card access limited to personnel with a need to enter serve to ensure that only qualified people are entering the facility.

Regular audits of both the RMP and PSM programs are done to ensure that we maintain compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations. Monthly tests for both emergency shut-down systems, involving a complete and live shutdown, are performed to ensure mechanical integrity of emergency functions. \n\n\n\nSPRWS has had no chorine or ammonia releases in the past 5 years.\n\n"
