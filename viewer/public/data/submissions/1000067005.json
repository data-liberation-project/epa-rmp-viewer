The ammonia refrigeration process at Ice Cube Cold Storage has been designed and operates in accordance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable State and Local codes and regulations.  Ice Cube Cold Storage has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the process, and the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in voluntary compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management rule.\n\n\n\nThrough the Ice Cube Cold Storage Emergency Action Plan as required under OSHA PSM, Ice Cube Cold Storage has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nIce Cube Cold Storage is a refrigerated warehouse and logistics facility primarily engaged in the refrigerated (cold storage) of seafood products.  The facility is situated  on an 11.2 acre industrially zoned parcel, and is an 80,000 sq. ft facility utilizing 7,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia within the process.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As the Ice Cube Cold Storage anhydrous ammonia storage capacity does not exceed the threshold, the facility is voluntarily filing the Risk Management Program.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 2 because it is not subject to OSHA-PSM provisions, and it is not eligible for Program 1.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with ANSI/ASHRAE guidance, as well as the Inte"

Process verification takes place through design audits by trained personnel and/or consultants and refrigeration contractors.  The schedule of such verifications is at least once every three years.\n\n\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis has bee completed for a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario to document the distance to toxic endpoint for each scenario, as well as the potential population, public and environmental receptors that fall within the radius of impact for each scenario.\n\n\n\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of Ice Cube Cold Storage's daily operations.  PM is performed in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases; the process safety equipment PM Schedule prescribed by Ice Cube Cold Storage exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.  Ammonia detection sensors are present at multiple locations and tested semi-annually.  Relief Valves are replaced on a 5 yr schedule according to best practices.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThis is a newly constructed facility and therefore there is no accident history.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located in the process, the facility, and the perimeter locations. A process release would also be detected by the employees by the characteristic odor of anhydrous ammonia at 3-5 ppm.  The ammonia sensors are tested semi-annually.  An alarm signal is triggered and would sound throughout the facility, as well as activate blue strobes if ammonia is detected.  An alarm system and control panel also notify specific individuals if operating parameters are exceeded, or an alarm occurs.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of a process release, the Unity Control System provides notification to the refrigeration engineer, and select Ice Cube Cold Storage personnel.  Ice Cube Cold Storage personnel would notify the Fall River Fire Department if any of the following conditions present:\n\n\n\n*U"
