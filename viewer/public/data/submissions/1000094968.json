Title 40, CFR Part 68, requires that Case Farms Chicken will manage the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of anhydrous ammonia.  To remain compliant, we promote Process Safety Management and Risk Management Planning compliance for the processing plant, our employees and the public. Overall, these activities prevent accidental injuries, illnesses and environmental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the Case Farms Chicken Winesburg Plant. We use the refrigerant for keeping the plant processing areas at a constant temperature, preserving product, chilling water, and making ice for use in product shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur safety programs are applied to activities involving anhydrous ammonia including transportation, storage, handling, and use. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe safety policies, procedures, plans and training that we have initiated help prevent accidents and incidents.  The rules are reviewed and improved as needed. They are also communicated to, and accepted by all employees and contractors at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\n\r\nCase Farms has  implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSM Volume 01 of the PSM/RMP Library incorporates several policies.
