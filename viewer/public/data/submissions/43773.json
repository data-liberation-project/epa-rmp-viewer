The facility is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA?s Risk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations are to ensure that the covered process (ammonia refrigeration) is designed, operated, and maintained safely. Compliance with these regulations helps prevent ammonia releases from the process. Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of ammonia in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nEmmpak Foods Distribution Center has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. This was accomplished through the development of a PSM Team comprised of Operations, Maintenance, Safety, and Engineering personnel, augmented by the support of refrigeration contractor personnel. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in every day operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe Emmpak Foods Distribution Center ?Emergency Evacuation and Contingency Plan? has been developed in concert with the Milwaukee Fire Department and the Milwaukee County Emergency Response Government. The plan addressed fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by the Emmpak Foods Distribution Center Emergency Response Team for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders. The plan includes ?Emergency Response to Anhydrous Ammonia,? specifically addressing incidents involving ammonia refrigeration.\n\nThe Emmpak Foods Distribution Center is located at 11225 West County Line Road.

      "SummaryText": "age facility. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of finished products. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most storage facilities. Anhydrous ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressure, but is utilized in the refrigeration process as a gas liquefied under pressure.\n\nEmmpak Foods Distribution Center operates one distinct ammonia refrigeration system within the facility. The Emmpak Foods Distribution Center refrigeration system is designed to provide the following:\n\n- operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations);\n- economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required);\n- optimal safety performance (through minimal use of ammonia liquid pumps, utilized instead the pressure differentials established in the system to move liquid refrigerant); and,\n- consistency of operations, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had an accident involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmmpak Foods Distribution Center emergency action plan is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119). Mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders if required. Our employees have been trained to take the appropriate actions necessary in our plan. The plan is coordinated with the Milwaukee County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Milwaukee Fire Department. We conduct periodic drills for implementation of the emergency action plan at the facility, and anticipate increased par"
