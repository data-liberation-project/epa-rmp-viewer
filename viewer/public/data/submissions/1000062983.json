This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substance, ammonia. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to coordinate with professional emergency responders and the facility's professional refrigeration service firm.\r\n\r\nThe emergency action plan provides the response organization with notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to effectively respond to emergency situations that may arise at the facility\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nThe primary business of FreshPoint Southern California is the storage and distribution of refrigerated food products. The facility is approximately 1.7 miles east of Interstate 605, approximately 1.9 miles north of Highway 60, and approximately 1.9 miles south of Interstate 10.  We maintain one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is approximately 10,700 pounds.  The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed-loop system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again. There are no expected discharges or emissions of ammonia associated with the refrigeration system. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTIONA PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CaIOSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR), the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), and the California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. \r\n\r\nAdministrative Measures:\r\n \r\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards.\r\nThe FreshPoint Southern California ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, FreshPoint Southern California operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CaIARP) Program, CalOSHA PSM Program, and EPA RMP Program. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\n\r\nThe facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include an Ammonia Dispersion Tank and ammonia sensors near the evaporators and inside the Engine Room. The compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits. Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not over"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\n\r\nFreshPoint Southern California has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\n\r\nFreshPoint Southern California carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\n\r\nFreshPoint Southern California conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\n\r\nFreshPoint Southern California promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
