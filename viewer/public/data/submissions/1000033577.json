Description of Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\nSSWI INC of Hammond Louisiana recognizes management's responsibility in the protection of its employees, equipment, property, the community, and environment. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the company.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish SSWI of Hammond La's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes government mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and activities that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of SSWI of Hammond Louisiana's Safety Program are to achieve maximum productivity, efficiency and safety performance.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with SSWI of Hammond Louisiana's Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program. These programs are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68). SSWI Inc of Hammond La's Safety Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of ammonia releases. The accidental release prevention and emergency response program is also established for the prevention and response to fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of incidents that may result in catastrophic accidents.

Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility operates a [NAICS#49312 (Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage Facility)] freezer warehouse at 510 Pride Boulevard Hammond, La 70401. An ammonia refrigeration system is in operation to maintain the storage and holding temperatures for neopryne products.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates an (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, which provides cooling throughout the facility. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS#7664-41-7) contained in this refrigeration system is in the excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. SSWI of Hammond Louisiana's maximum potential ammonia inventory in the refrigeration system is calculated to be approximately 24,600 pounds. However, the actual ammonia inventory in the system is estimated to be approximately 11,900 pounds.  Due to the volume of ammonia and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, which could pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\r\n\r\nC. Summary of Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n1. Worst-Case\r\nThe SSWI Hammond Warehouse is equipped with a two-stage ammonia refrigerating system. For ammonia refrigeration systems, a storage vessel or high-pressure receiver is likely the source of the worst-case release quantity. The facility's ammonia refrigeration system consist of low stage and high stage compressors, whereby ammonia travels throughout the circuit from the discharge of the compressors, through the evaporative condensers, to the high pressure receiver (HPR-\r\n1). The system was not designed with a separate ammonia storage vessel and therefore the entire contents of the system will either drain down or be pumped down to this receiver, if necessary, to remove ammonia from the system. The high pressure receiver is the largest vessel in the SSWI Hammond Warehouse refrigeration system."

Under these conditions it was assumed that, as required by the RMP regulations, the entire contents of this vessel would be released in a catastrophic failure. The high pressure receiver is located within a portion of the warehouse structure, i.e., a building; however, HPR-1 is positioned near an opening in the building (i.e., a door to the exterior).  The potential quantity of ammonia that could be released in the worst-case release scenario was based on a conservative estimate of the maximum shell capacity of the high pressure receiver, HPR-1. Administrative controls and normal operating activities would likely be cause for less ammonia in HPR-1, but a conservative approach was used to model the offsite consequences in a worst-case scenario. Since HPR-1 is located near a door in the warehouse building and makeup air vents for the room ventilation system, it was assumed that the entire contents of the vessel will be released through these openings when modeling this scenario; therefore, no passive mitigation measures were considered for the worst-case scenario.  The calculated weight released during the worst-case scenario was found to be approximately 8,850 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is unlikely for the following reasoons:\r\n-Industry standards and quality controls were followed in the design and construction of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n-Ammonia is not corrosive in this process.\r\n-Pressure safety relief valves limit the operating pressures in this receiver.\r\n-The facility utilizes a preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the vessel.\r\n-The facility has a training program that insures only qualified personnel operate the system.\r\n-The facility requires that all PSM elements as well as company maintenance policies be followed.\r\n-The facility has coordinated its emergency"

First Alternate Release Scenario\r\nTransfer Hose Alternative Release Scenario - Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the SSWI Hammond Warehouse facility by a local supplier that hauls it by motor truck transport. The tanker trucks reportedly utilized to haul ammonia include a small tanker (6,500-gallon capacity) and a larger tanker (9,055-gallon capacity). However, due to state and federal highway gross weight limits (tractor and tanker) the transporter only hauls a reported 85 percent (%) of the small tanker and 70% of the larger tanker (i.e., 85% of 6,500 gallons = 5,524 gallons and 70% of 9,055 gallons = 6,338 gallons). The tankers trucks used are not compartmentalized. The tanker trucks have passive mitigation systems that would shut down transfer in the event of a low-pressure drop; however, this scenario assumes that this mitigation system also fails during the release.For this alternative scenario, it was assumed that the transporter was making multiple\r\ndeliveries and stopped at SSWI first (i.e., with a full load) since the ammonia supplier is located in close proximity to the warehouse. It was assumed that the hose on the transfer truck developed a leak and approximately one-tenth of the load was released to the ground before being discovered and the discharge valve shut off. To be conservative the largest full load tanker, or 70% of 9055 gallons = 6,338 gallons, was being used during delivery the day of the release. The calculated pounds released during this alternative scenario would be approximately 5,150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nB. Second Alternate Release Scenario\r\nProcess Piping Alternative Release Scenario - Process pipework runs along the roof of the SSWI Hammond Warehouse to evaporative condensers and penetrates the roof at various locations to discharge ammonia to the various evaporators. A number of release areas from process pipework were considered in t"

      "SummaryText": "his scenario. It is conceivable that an ammonia leak can occur from almost any piping component, i.e., a valve, flange, fitting, etc; however, based on discussion with the ammonia maintenance contractor, the most common leak in an ammonia system, such as the one utilized by SSWI, would be a rust hole leak from a weak weld or erosion at an elbow. It is assumed that gas would be released from a one eighth-\r\ninch diameter hole in the piping.  When gas stored under pressure in a closed vessel is discharged to the atmosphere\r\nthrough a hole or other opening, the gas velocity through that opening may be choked (i.e., attain a maximum velocity).\r\nUsing the equation for estimating the unmitigated release rate of a toxic gas from a hole in a pipe, provided in Chapter 7.1.1 for Gaseous Releases in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, March 2009, the release rate from a failed pressure regulator was calculated as 1.66 pounds per minute, based on the following assumptions for equipment pressure (180 pounds per square inch) and temperature (160 degrees Fahrenheit). This method neglects the effects of friction along the pipe and, therefore, provides a conservative estimate of the release rate.\r\nThe equation provides an estimate of the initial release rate. It overestimates the overall release rate, because it does not take into account the decrease in the release rate as the pressure in the equipment decreases.  Furthermore we assumed that the release would extend for some time period before being discovered. If assuming that the leak developed during the weekend, it could be two to three days before it was detected. Over the course of 48 hours (2,880 minutes)\r\nthe total amount of ammonia that would leak would be approximately 4,800 pounds.\r\n\r\nC. Third Alternate Release Scenario\r\nCompressor Failure Alternative Release Scenario - Another alternative scenario examined was a catastrophic failure of one of the facility's five compressors, which wou"

The cavity in a compressor has very little capacity, due to the casing design and therefore, the compressor itself would release only a small amount of ammonia in the engine room. The largest amount of ammonia vapor that could potentially be released will leak (de-pressurize) from the high-stage discharge (HSD)piping that runs vertically to the HSD header and the high-stage suction (HSS) piping leading to the compressor from the HSS header, in the machine room. The release amount was estimated to be 100 pounds.  \r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenarios are unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n-SSWI of Hammond La has policies to enforce only that competent personnel work on the system and has the power to remove any offending employee and/or contractor from the companies payroll and or contracts.\r\n-The system was designed using standard practices and is maintained by rigid company standards.\r\n-The maintenance program includes a mechanical integrity audit system.\r\n-The maintenance program includes a shift monitoring procedure of the refrigeration system by fully trained personnel.\r\n-Low level controls, sensors for ammonia monitoring, and maintaining a safe ammonia liquid supply to the vessels acts as active mitigation before the release poses a threat to offsite receptors.\r\n-The piping is routed to avoid impact from traffic sources. A majority of the pipes are located on the roof.\r\n-Forklift operators have been trained and certified by the company, and trained in the locations and operations of the ammonia refrigeration evaporators that are located within their working areas.\r\n-Industry standards were followed for the manufacturing of the ammonia vessels, and the vessels were supplied by a reputable company meeting the guidelines spelled out in the Company's Process Safety Management's Contractors requi"
