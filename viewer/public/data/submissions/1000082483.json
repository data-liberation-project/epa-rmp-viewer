If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.Facility Information.\r\n\r\nA\u00b7The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\r\nA\u00b7Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\r\nA\u00b7The maximum quantity stored would be 250,000# in our three tanks, which are 30,000, 15,000, and 12,000 gal. vessels.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi transport with the capacity of approximately 40,000#.\r\n\r\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nA\u00b7The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or semi transport) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume the 30,000 gal. storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.82 miles.\r\nA\u00b7\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\r\n\r\n4.The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nA\u00b7The facility has implemented the provisions of A\u00bfSafety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1A\u00bf, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, A\u00bfStorage and handling of anhydrous ammonia"
