              "Description": "WinCo's implementation of the RMP/PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee exposure to accidental releases. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program(mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-start-up safety reviews and management of change(MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to operate, maintain and work on the refrigeration system. WinCo has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a component for conducting compliance audits to ensure the RMP/PSM program is being implemented at WinCo's Boise facility. Lastly the RMP/PSM program incorporates the facility's Emergency Action Plan and places special emphasis  on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response activities with the local fire department and other response agencies.
