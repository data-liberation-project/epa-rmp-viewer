The facility processes ready to cook and fully cooked bacon and processes and packages chili, beans and other kettle cooked specialties. The NAICS code for the processes at the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one RMP regulated refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating meat products. The system originally contained a charge of 21,000 pounds of ammonia.  The amount of ammonia currently present in this refrigeration system is approximately 26,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\nA topographic map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A.

This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules.

The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\u00b7\tEmployee Participation \u00bf Otto & Sons has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.
