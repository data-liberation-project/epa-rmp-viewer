This facility is known as the Alabama Reclamation Plant and is located at 1009 Ford Road. The reclamation facility consists of a plant which manufactures molten aluminum or aluminum ingot.. Reynolds Metals Company built the facility in 1969 and it was purchased by Wise Alloys LLC in April 1999. This facility is one of the largest in the world of its kind and has processes including aluminum delaquering, melting, casting, and storage. The facility employs 142 full-time employees.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices at the Stationary Source (68.155(a))\n\nWise Alloys LLC is committed to operating the Alabama Reclamation Plant in a manner that is safe for workers, the public and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices. As part of this commitment, the Alabama Reclamation Plant has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes of this facility which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risk at the Alabama Reclamation Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and OSHA 1910.119. The document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Alabama Reclamation Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the Alabama Reclamation Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n7 A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances re"

In fact, the Alabama Reclamation Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nWise Alloys LLC's policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Alabama Reclamation Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Alabama Reclamation Plant, Wise Alloys reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects. This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nWise Alloys strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. Wise Alloys implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Alabama Reclamation Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.

In addition, Wise Alloys requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. The Alabama Reclamation Plant Mechanical Integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nThe Alabama Reclamation Plant's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release: In the event of an accidental release, the Alabama Reclamation Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment. Wise Alloys utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. Wise Alloys trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. The Alabama Reclamation Plant also has designated Gate 5 (at the Wise Alloys Plant) as a Special Situations Center to assist in all emergencies. In addition, Wise Alloys works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur. Wise Alloys has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Colbert County Community Awareness and Emergency Plan (CAER).\n\nThe Alabama Reclamation Plant emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, and EPA regulations. This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Alabama Reclamation Plant.

Operating procedures include:\n\n7 Steps for safely conducting activities\n7 Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of  process deviations\n7 Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\n\nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown and temporary operations. The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the plant's processes and as a training guide.\n\n4.1.4 Training\nThe Alabama Reclamation Plant trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. The training program includes both initial and refresher courses that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process. The employees are consulted annually at safety meetings to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training. Recommendations from the employees are revi"

The plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n4.1.9 Incident Investigation\nThe Alabama Reclamation Plant investigates accidents, including near misses, that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public or the environment so that similar incidents can be prevented in the future. The plant trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\nThe Alabama Reclamation Plant has a formal program including training for incident investigations and the report generation.\n"
