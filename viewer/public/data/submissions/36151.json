The maximum quantity of C4 Mixture onsite at any time is estimated to be 26,000,000 pounds.  This estimate is based upon the total storage capacity of C4 Mixture with an allowance for piping and material in process.\r\n\r\nPropane: This represents propane in storage.  The maximum quantity of propane onsite at any time is estimated to be 1,000,000 pounds.  This estimate is based upon the total storage capacity of propane with an allowance for piping and material in process.  \r\n\r\nChlorine: Chlorine is used for Refinery water treatment at the River Pump Station only.  Chlorine is fed to this process from 2000-pound bullet tanks.  The maximum quantity of chlorine onsite at any one time is estimated to be 8,000 pounds.  Sinclair removed the chlorine systems within the refinery and replaced it with a non-hazardous treatment system.  This reduced our maximum quantity of chlorine onsite from 36,000 pounds to 8,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has multiple processes, which contain H2S and SO2.  The maximum quantity of H2S and SO2 onsite does not exceed 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.  Therefore, these compounds do not meet RMP threshold levels.  However, we do have prevention and safety programs in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program. \r\n\r\n5-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has not had any RMP-defined accidents.  While releases have been documented, none have been of threshold substances, nor have these releases had offsite consequences.

The team makes recommendations about systems, procedures, or practices to put in place to ensure to hazards are managed and mitigated.  \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for review and resolution.  Implementation of systems, procedures, and practices are based on a determination of risk with the items.
