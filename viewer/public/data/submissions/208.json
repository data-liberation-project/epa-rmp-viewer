      "SummaryText": "The Millington Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWWTP) has chlorine on site that requires protection as defined under the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The City of Millington, Tennessee (the City) has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe MWWTP treats and disposes of all sanitary waste discharged to the City Sewer System.  The facility utilizes two (2) 1-Ton cylinders (4,000 lbs.) of chlorine (a gas liquefied under pressure) in the wastewater treatment process.  The MWWTP handles 2.5 million gallons/day (MGD) and has a maximum load design of 5.0 MGD.\n\nThe worst-case release and the alternate release scenarios are delineated below.  EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) was used in the consequence analyses.\n\nWorst Case\nChemical and Amount Released:  2,000 lbs. of chlorine in 10 minutes inside the Chlorinator Room of the Maintenance Building.\nWeather Conditions:  77 F with a 3.4 mph wind in Class F atmospheric stability.\n\nThis release would impact the urban area around the MWWTP within a 0.9 mile radius and affect 533 residents, two (2) churches, including a church with a week day school, a pet cemetery and a convenience store.\n\nAlternate Case:\nChemical and Amount Released:  2,000 lbs. of chlorine in 60 minutes inside the Chlorinator Room of the Maintenance Building.\nWeather Conditions:  77 F with a 6.7 mph wind in Class D atmospheric stability.\n\nThis release would impact the urban area around the MWWTP within a 0.1 mile radius and affect 39 residents and anyone visiting the pet cemetery.\n\nThe MWWTP is in compliance with OSHA PSM and emergency action plan regulations, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 rules."

The MFD has trained Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) technicians that can handle any accidental chlorine release.  The MFD provides emergency response training to MWWTP personnel.  Should the need for an evacuation occur, the Millington Police Department (MPD) will notify all households identified by the MFD to be within a 0.9 mile radius.  The MFD also hqas a mutual aid agreement with the Naval Support Activity (NSA).  NSA can respond with a HAZMAT Team within 10 minutes.\n\nAnnual wastewater operator certification continuing education maintains and continually imporves safety at the MWWTP."
