This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Delmita Gas Plant located in Starr County, Texas is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C. and is operated by Enterprise.\n\nThe Delmita Gas Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of a cryogenic gas liquid recovery plant and liquid fractionation facilities.  The liquid extraction plant  designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and is assembled primarily from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components.     Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  The plant processes the gas utilizing the turbo expander plant to remove recoverable natural gas liquids.  Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by a hydrocarbon liquid pipeline system.  The plant also contains fractionation equipment which can be used to further process the recovered mixed hydrocarbon liquid stream, separating them into relatively pure propane, mixed butane and natural gasoline streams.  In addition, Delmita Plant receives via tank truck a deethanized mixed liquid product from other remote gas gas processing facilitie"

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a \u00bfnear-miss\u00bf reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Delmita Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are documented and retained.\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Delmita Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.

This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Delmita Gas Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to insure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the Delmita Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Delmita Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help insure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
