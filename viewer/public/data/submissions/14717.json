Prillaman Chemical is an industrial chemical distributor that provides products in support of industries, ranging from food and water treatment to textiles and furniture.  Activities include warehousing, packaging, bulk transfer and formulation of many common industrial chemicals.  We serve Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.\nWe are members of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and as members, we pledge to manage our business according to the principles of the NACD's Responsible Distribution Process.  This process provides a system that promotes continuous improvement in the health, safety and environmental performance of our company.  It is designed to be sensitive and responsive to community needs and public concerns.  In addition, Prillaman Chemical has a Quality Improvement Process that makes safety and environmental concerns an on-going priority.\nWe as team members of Prillaman Chemical and as menbers of our communities are committed to the safe handling of the products that we distribute as well as the safe operation of our facilities, but we also recognize that emergencies relating to those activities can occur.  It is our policy to ensure that emergency response units and the public will have adequate information to allow them to react properly to emergencies, which could result from our activities.  Accordingly, we have written procedures, which we will take to minimize the effects of such events.\nPrillaman Chemical Corporation-Suffolk, VA operates a warehouse, two bulk inorganic tank farms, bleach manufacturing plant and chlorine repackaging plant.  All of these operations are located at 201 Suburban Drive in Suffolk, VA.  The facility site occupies approximately 7 acres.  Prillaman stores and distributes chlorine, sulfur dioxide, ethylenediamine (EDA) and aqua ammonia.  EDA, chlorine and aqua ammonia ar"

Sulfur dioxide, which is stored at the facility, is also regulated under RMP.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are regulated as toxic under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119.  Bleach is also manufactured at the facility from chlorine and caustic soda using a continuous process.\nThe worst case scenario for aqua ammonia would be a sudden and large rupture of a tanker containing 45,000 lbs.  This would affect the area contained in a 1.15 mile radius from the release.  Public receptors within this radius include residences, offices, industrial areas and one school.  This is not a very likely scenario in that it would take a large sharp object moving at a high rate of speed to cause such a rupture.  A more likely scenario would be a valve being sheared off a liquid container holding 2550 lbs. of aqua ammonia.  This would affect the area contained in a 0.30 mile radius from the release.  The only public receptors would be a nearby industrial area and a small number of residences.\nThe worst case scenario for chlorine would be a sudden and large rupture of a chlorine railcar containing 180,000 lbs.  This would affect the area contained in a 14 mile radius from the release.  Public receptors within this radius include schools, residences, hospitals, correctional facilities, recreational facilities, commercial areas and industrial areas.  This is not a likely scenario in that chlorine railcars are made of thick metal and have valves that do not permit excessive flow.  A more likely scenario would be the over chlorination of a manufacturing tank.  This would release 4000 lbs and affect the area contained in a 0.5 mile radius from the release.  Public receptors within this radius includes residences, offices, industrial areas and one school.  Several safeguards are in place to prevent this scenario.

Additionally, if the recirculation pump shuts down, an alarm is sounded in the department warning the user of the manufacturing tank to cease the flow of chlorine.

Public receptors within this radius would include schools, residences, a correctional facility, a hospital, recreational facilities, offices and commercial/industrial areas.  This is not a very likely scenario for the same reasons mentioned previously for the aqua ammonia tanker.  A more likely scenario would be a leak in a container holding 400 lbs. of EDA.  This would affect the area contained in a 0.60 mile radius from the release.  Public receptors would include residences, commercial/industrial areas, offices and one school.\nThe worst case scenario for sulfur dioxide would be a sudden and large rupture of a 2000 lb. container.  This would affect the area contained in a 1.3 mile radius from the release.  Public receptors would include residences, offices, commercial/industrial areas and one school.  This would not be a very likely scenario in that these are thick walled, heavy metal containers.  A more likely scenario would be a fuse plug failure in a 2000 lb. container.

All on site personnel receive extensive training in the handling, use and emergency procedures for all hazardous materials on an annual basis.  A portion of the on site personnel are specifically trained, qualified and equipped under OSHA 1910.120 as Emergency Hazmat Responders to immediately handle on and offsite problems.  Two times per year drills are conducted with one of these drills involving the outside agencies.  These drills are targeted toward both worst case and alternative scenarios.

Contact numbers are also available via copies of the Contingency Plan annually updated and given to all potential responding agencies.  The Emergency Coordinator will notify all appropriate local, State and Federal emergency response groups as needed.  Documented checks on all evacuation, alarm and alert sytems are performed monthly.\nIn the future we intend to install a fully automatic shut down system to control the chlorine railcars.  This system will be activated by the plantwide Chlorine Detection System making no human response necessay to stop chlorine flow from the railcars.  The proposed system has just become very reliable in the last year and the facility Process Safety Management Group has recommended its installation.  The Process Safety Management Group meets on a regular basis with its sole responsibility being to continually improve and evaluate the systems that handle the covered chemicals along with the procedures and emergency response."
