      "SummaryText": "SePRO Corporation has over 400 acres that borders Bellamy Mill Road and Watson Seed Farm Road in Whitakers, NC.  The site consists of turf grass farm, offices, research laboratories and small manufacturing areas.  There are five buildings on site and approximately 12 employees.  In the western- most building (No. 5) manufacturing of agriculture service products occur.\r\nEthylenediamine (EDA) is a chemical purchased by SePRO for use in manufacturing two products.  It is purchased in tank trucks and unloaded into a specially designed storage tank.  Approximately 40,000 pounds are received on each shipment.\r\nThe storage tank (T-510) is constructed of Stainless steel and is filled by pumping  ethylenediamine (EDA) from the tanker.  The tank is 6100 gallons and is adequate to hold the 5000 gallon shipment.  The tank is equipped with a heating/cooling jacket on the bottom, insulation and a rigid stainless steel covering.  The tank operates at atmospheric pressure and is sealed with a conservation vent.  It is equipped with ultrasonic level indication and an independent level detector that initiates shutdown in an overfill event.   \r\nThe tank is located outside in a containment dike 28 feet square and 3.5 feet deep.  This 20,000 gallon  containment is adequate for holding  6100 gallons of  ethylenediamine (EDA) in the event of a catastrophic failure.\r\nEthylenediamine (EDA) is transferred to the manufacturing processes through stainless steel pump and piping.  Normal operation uses well below 20,000 lbs per batch.\r\nEthylenediamine freezes at 51 F and must be maintained above this temperature.   The flashpoint of ethylenediamine  has a flashpoint of 103 F.    When heating is used to maintain a liquid state,  the heating media will be less than 95F.  The OSHA 8-hour Time-weighed hour exposure limit (TWA) is 10 ppm. \r\nTriethanolamine (TEA) will also be stored inside the containment dike.  Ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are compatible and present no additional hazards from"
