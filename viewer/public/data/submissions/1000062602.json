Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the facility.  The entire anhydrous ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nArctic Logistics, LLC is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, and maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Unforseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Canton Fire Department and Hazmat Team, which provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nWorse Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nWorst-case and alternative-case release scenarios were developed using the methodology provided in the EPA's RMP Comp.  The details of the chosen scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration system are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Program\n\n\n\nArctic Logistics, LLC has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements noted in 40 CFR Part 68.
