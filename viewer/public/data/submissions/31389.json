EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Shell Chemical Company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Shell Chemical Company workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Shell Chemical Company has established systems to ensure safe operation of the facility.  One part of this system is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Shell Chemical Company.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Shell Chemical Company in Geismar, LA.\n\nThis submittal has been issued to reflect the addition of two new units (AO-3 and K-5), which fall under RMP guidelines.  K-5 Unit qualifies under Prevention Program Level 1 requirements.   AO-3 qualifies under Prevention Program Level 3 requirements.  Since first submittal, one unit (PK-1) has been shutdown and is being dismantled.  It has been removed from the program.  The PDO unit is currently in a mothball state with anticipated startup in 2003 so updates reflect period of time it was running.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nShell Chemical Company implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel respond to control and contain such releases as appropriate.  Each situation is evaluated individually and appropriate measures are taken to protect the employees and the community.  Shell Chemical Company, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and neighboring industry have established"

A local siren warning system is in place and tested routinely.\n\n1.2 The Shell Chemical Company and Regulated Substances\n\nShell Chemical Company handles many substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  The information below indicates the processes as defined by the rule and the regulated substances therein:\n\n- AO-1, 2 &3 and ID-1&2 - Alpha and internal olefin production - Program 3:   1-butene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans, ethane, methane, ethylene, 1-pentene, propylene, and chlorine.\n\n- EOEG - Ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol production - Program 3:  methane, ethylene, and ethylene oxide.\n\n- K-2/3/4/5 - Detergent range alcohol production - Program 1:  Hydrogen.\n\n- PDO-1 - 1,3-propanediol production - Program 3:  Acetaldehyde, hydrogen, methane, and ethylene oxide.\n\n- Utilities Chlorine and Ammonia - Chlorine and ammonia used in water treatment processes in the Utilities system - Program 3:  Ammonia and chlorine\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nShell Chemical Company performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Shell Chemical Company does not expect a worst case scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of the facility like Shell Chemical Company.  ARSs help the LEPC improve the community response plan.  \n\nRadii of potential impact for all release scenarios were determined using guidance in the RMP rule and the lookup tables from the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document, dated May 24, 1996 and RMP* COMP Version 1.07.\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the "

Because the processes at the Shell Chemical plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Shell Chemical Company keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments and individuals in the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis    \nThe Shell Chemical Company Geismar Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Geismar plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.

They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Shell Chemical Geismar periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at the specified frequency until the process ceases to operate.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Shell Chemical Geismar plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operation such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shell Chemical Geismar has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  To be qualified to perform a particular job, the Technician must complete the training for that job.  Initial and refresher training records for each employee involved in operating a covered process are maintained in the Shell Traini"

Contract employees are not involved in operating covered processes.  Training records include the name of the employee and the date of the training.  Where applicable, copies of tests and other means used to verify that the employee understood the training are maintained.  The training places an emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the job.  \n\nContractors\nThe Shell Chemical Company uses contractors regularly and to supplement the workforce during periods of high activity.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Shell Chemical Company has procedures in place to ensure contractors have the proper knowledge of and training on plant systems, procedures, and processes before they go to work at the site.  Safety performance constitutes a major factor in the overall evaluation of contractor performance and Shell performs periodic evaluations of contractor compliance with Shell and regulatory requirements.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nShell Chemical Company conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, all major projects, major turnarounds, and minor turnarounds require a PSSR to be performed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team creates an Expected State of Readiness Document, which is used to verify all aspects of the organization's readiness.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Shell Chemical Company has well-established practices "

The basic aspects of the mechanical integrity program include (1) training for process maintenance activities, (2) inspection and testing of process equipment, (3) correction of identified equipment deficiencies as appropriate, and (4) quality assurance in construction, installation and spare parts.\n\nMaintenance personnel are knowledgeable of the safety and health hazards of the work areas, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Inspection and tests are performed to help ensure that process equipment functions as intended, and to verify that this equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service, or the Mechanical Equipment Team (MET) or the Pressure Systems Team (PST) will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nShell Chemical Company has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nShell Chemical Company promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Shell Chemical Company management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Shell Chemical Company plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are maintained.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe processes at Shell Chemical Company have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Shell Chemical Company has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n- Stationary ethylene oxide monitors with alarms\n- Process alarms\n- Personal exposure monitors\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n- Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n- Scrubbers to neutralize/minimize chemical releases\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n- Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high leve"
