              "Description": "Cognis' Cincinnati plant uses safety systems and procedures to prevent accidents. The systems are reviewed regularly and, where needed, improved. Equipment is constructed to State of Ohio and nationally recognized codes and designed to withstand the maximum pressure, temperature and corrosive nature of the contained chemical.   Special instruments continuously monitor process conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and automatically alarm if they go outside acceptable ranges.  Critical alarms trigger safety interlocks that shut down the process.  To maintain the integrity of our equipment, verification checks are performed at frequencies recommended by the equipment manufacturers.  Equipment deficiencies are addressed immediately.  Qualified personnel complete full, in-depth Process Hazards Analysis that are revalidated at least every five years as specified by OSHA regulations.  Recommendations are developed to further protect our employees, neighbors and local environment.  Operating instructions have been written to detail how processes are safely started, operated and shut down.  These procedures are accuracy-certified each year, per OSHA regulations.  All operators, maintenance mechanics and contractors are trained and qualified to perform their job duties.  Engineers, operators and mechanics jointly complete a final safety check prior to introducing hazardous chemicals into a new or modified process. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are completed after maintenance turnarounds. Management personnel must authorize all changes to the chemicals used, equipment, or operating conditions.  Potential safety and environmental impacts must be remedied before any change can take place.  Work permits are necessary prior to working on equipment that last contained hazardous chemicals.  These permits are used to verify that the equipment has been properly prepared to prevent a chemical exposure or fire.  Our entire site perimeter is fenced.   Guards are stationed at the plant gate around the clock. All chemical release incidents are investigated and actions taken to prevent recurrence. Triennial audits are performed to insure the chemical release prevention program requirements are followed.",

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAt Cognis Corporation's Cincinnati, Ohio manufacturing plant, protection of employees, the public and the environment is considered to be the most important responsibility.  A key element of the plant's protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, plant personnel are prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\nThe plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from local emergency response organizations.\n\nThe plant's Risk Management Program (RMP) plan was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP plan describes the incidents that would have the most catastrophic effects (the \"worst-case release scenarios\") and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (\"alternative release scenarios\"). Although it is technically infeasible for the worst-case release scenarios described in this plan to occur, the information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to incidents of lesser magnitude, which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using RMP*Comp (Ver 1.07), which was developed by U. S. EPA for accidental chemical release modeling.\n\nCOGNIS CORPORATION\n\nCognis Corporation, which was previously part of Henkel Corporation, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the worldwide Henkel Group in July 1999.  In November 2001, it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cognis Deutschlan"

The company has dedicated its activities to a high level of sustainability and delivers natural source raw materials and ingredients for food, nutrition and healthcare products, cosmetics, detergents and cleaners.  Cognis also provides solutions for a number of other industries, such as coatings and inks, lubricants, textiles, plastics, agriculture and mining.  The company as a whole has almost 8,000 employees and operates in close to 50 different countries.  \n\nCognis Corporation recently rejoined the American Chemistry Council's and is developing plans to comply with Responsible Care; and its manufacturing facilities are certified under the ISO 14000 Environmental Management System Standard.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe policy at Cognis Corporation's Cincinnati plant is to prevent all releases of potentially harmful substances.  Senior management is responsible for release prevention and response programs, and considerable time and resources have been invested in this effort.  \n\nThe plant has detailed procedures to ensure that safety is considered in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of each process.  Plant personnel receive regular safety training, and employee input is solicited on every aspect of safety performance improvement.  Failure to follow safety policies is grounds for dismissal.\n\nIf a release were to occur, trained personnel would control and contain the release.  The standard procedure is to technically evaluate each situation, identify potential on-site and off-site impacts, evacuate or shelter employees as necessary, contain the release and contact the local fire department to control the release and minimize its consequences.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE \n\nThe Cognis Corporation's Cincinnati, Ohio plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located at 4900 Este Avenue.  A variety of processes are operated at the plant "

Part of the plant is located in the City of Cincinnati and part is located in the City of St. Bernard.  The two parts are separated by the Mill Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River.  Fatty alcohols, glycerin, esters, synthetic lubricants and surfactants are produced at the Cincinnati plant. These products are used in household and industrial cleaners, personal care products, biodegradable synthetic lubricants, adhesives, agricultural products, plasticizers, and other special applications.  \n\nThe plant is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety regulations and is regularly inspected by agency representatives.  The following activities are specifically regulated:\n\nA? Air emissions - permits issued by Ohio EPA,\nA? Wastewater - discharge permit issued by the Metropolitan Sewer District,\nA? Oil spill prevention - subject to OPA-90 regulations,\nA? Storm water - permit issued by Ohio EPA,\nA? Hazardous waste management - U. S. EPA ID# OHD093903235,\nA? Process safety - subject to OSHA Process Safety Management Rule,\nA? Emergency planning - subject to SARA 311/312 reporting, and\nA? Toxic chemical release reporting - subject to SARA 313 reporting (ID # 45232 HNKLC4900E).\n\nDESCRIPTION OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Cincinnati plant handles one chemical in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP regulations.  Hydrogen, which is regulated as a flammable substance, is used as a process ingredient in the Hydrogenation processes that are part of the Fatty Alcohol manufacturing operations.  All of these processes have been assigned to RMP Program Level 3.\n\nNOTE:  The reporting of this Hydrogen system is a duplicate reporting. The system has also been reported by Air Products, Inc.

The dual reporting is by mutual consent of both companies.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \n\nFollowing U. S. EPA guidance, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA included both worst-case release scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Considering the design of the regulated processes and the plant's accident prevention programs, it is virtually impossible for the WCSs to occur.  Although it is highly unlikely that the ARSs would ever occur, the ARSs represent release scenarios that are at least somewhat feasible. \n\nThe main objective of the OCA was to determine the furthest distance (called the endpoint distance) at which certain conditions might exist as a result of an accidental chemical release.  Most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences are possible.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Cincinnati plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  The RMP regulations require companies to report all significant releases from regulated processes that occurred during the past five years.  The plant has not had any releases subject to reporting.  There have been a few small chemical releases, but none of them had an offsite impact.  Plant personnel are available to answer any related questions.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Cincinnati plant.  Since processes at the plant that are regulated under the RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management sys"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cincinnati plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents, and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets.

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates the hazards associated with a process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least once every five years, and they will continue to be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  They are reviewed periodically and certified annually as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change (MOC) process. In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond should an upset situation occur, such as an electrical outage or process alarm.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and is provided to other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for proces"

      "SummaryText": "s operations, the plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\nContractors\n\nThe plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\nA? Perform their work in a safe manner, \nA? Have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\nA? Are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\nA? Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,\nA? Understand and follow site safety rules, and \nA? Inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with the necessary training prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\nThe plant conducts a PSSR for any new facilityor major modification of an existing facility. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This revi"

The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nPSSR's are also conducted after the completion of Maintenance Turnaround. The Maintenance Turnaround PSSR is completed before maintenance is released from the shutdown and before the plant is restarted. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic elements of this program include:\n\nA? Conducting training,\nA? Developing written procedures,\nA? Performing inspections and tests,\nA? Correcting identified deficiencies, and\nA? Applying quality assurance measures.\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine "
