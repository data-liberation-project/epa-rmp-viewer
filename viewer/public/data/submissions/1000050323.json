EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Milan ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe ammonia PSM program at Milan includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews and managing change within the system. The different sections of the PSM document detail employee participation (hazard analysis team), process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA - what-if/checklist), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits and emergency planning and response (HAZWOPER plan).  The plant, therefore, maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\r\n\r\n2.\tMilan has researched information pertaining to the properties and hazards of ammonia, sought professional assistance from experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, and used many internal resources to develop a reference manual.  Block flow diagrams and P&IDA\u00bfs have been developed and are updated as the ammonia refrigeration system audits are completed.\r\n\r\n3.\tMilan has established a hazards analysis team (comprising of plant employees)  responsible for updating existing operating procedures for the refrigeration system and also verifying and documenting the mechanical integrity of the system.\r\n\r\n4.\tIn the event of a catastrophic release or an incident which could have resulted in a catastrophe, investigations will be undertaken (this is a policy of the PSM document).

The sections of the response document contain detailed information on emergency phone numbers, notification procedures, contacting emergency personnel, incident command structure, hazardous material releases, evacuation and relocation procedures, and emergency health services.\r\n\r\nMilan's emergency response plan (HAZWOPER) is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.  All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Milan Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.   The Milan Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.

The Milan facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented a HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees, the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response program, We emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, Milan has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as an evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the our HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at the Milan Processing facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Milan Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\r\n\r\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nMilan Processing is a producer of frozen dog food products, specifically chicken, turkey, and pork products.

      "SummaryText": "e regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The Milan plant has one ammonia refrigeration process for the preservation of the food products.  The quantity of ammonia stored at the plant is approximately 10,000 pounds.  \r\n \r\n3.0\tWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each process.  Since the Milan facility has two processes, one worst-case and two alternative scenarios were developed.\r\n\r\nAmmonia \r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\r\n\r\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\r\n\r\n1.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\r\n2.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\r\n\r\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nMilan has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration systems.
