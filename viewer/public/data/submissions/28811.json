High pressure gas from the wells is sent to a high pressure separator with the gas being routed to a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in two 48,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks operating at approximately 200 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility either by pipeline or transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in two bulk atmospheric storage tanks (3500 and 1000 barrels respectively) and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks. \n\nThe facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it contains threshold quantities of Butane as NGL and pentane as condensate.The facility is able to contain 249,600 lb of butane and 808,500 lb of pentane.\n\nThe NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nThis facility has two applicable worst case release scenarios.  Scenario # 1 involves an explosion and fire from an NGL release from the single largest vessel of 48,000 gallons.  Scenario # 2 involves an explosion and fire from a condensate release from the single largest tank which is 3,500 barrels.  Both scenarios yield the same distance to the endpoint which is 0.5 miles.

      "SummaryText": "RMP shows the calculations used for each scenario.\n\nAn alternative scenario is not required for this facility because it is classified as a Program 1 site.  \n\nThe worst case release scenarios use the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel thus no administrative controls or mitigation measures are used to limit the volume thus limiting the distance to the endpoint.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.  The operator is aware of the General Duty Clause in the Louisiana regulations (see Section 1.4 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Program\" document in the front sleeve of this plan) and accidental release prevention is a policy adopted by the operator.\n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of this plan, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.    \n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this plan and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
