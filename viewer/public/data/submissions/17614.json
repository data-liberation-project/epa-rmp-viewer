      "SummaryText": "Reiss Industries manufactures polyurethane foam furniture padding which is produced by the reaction of diisocyanates with polyether polyols  The toluene diisocyanate (TDI) used in the process is the chemical covered by the Risk Management Plan requirements of 40 CFR 68.\n\nSenior management is fully committed to the safety of its employees and the community.  An accidental release and emergency response program has been developed and approved by the State of Wisconsin Emergency Response Board, the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the local fire department.  The highly unlikely worst-case release scenario would be the complete rupture of the 6500 gallon TDI/MDI bulk storage tank which is located inside of and at the lowest point of the plant.  Should such a rupture occur the extremely low volatility TDI would form a 1970 square meter pool (all within the building) which would evaporate TDI at the rate of 0.233 pounds per min. within the building.  Considering the passive mitigation the building provides, the release rate to the atmosphere would be 0.0233 pounds per minute.  Atmospheric dispersion modeling using EPA's ISCST model predicts that the distance to the toxic endpoint would be only 24.75 meters (.015 miles) from the source, this is well within the Reiss Industries property boundries - no public or environmental receptors would be within the endpoint distance.\n          \nAll Reiss Industries employees are trained regarding the health hazards of TDI, and appropriate response measures should a TDI spill occur.  Emergency response training for employees occurs at regular intervals; no less than once per year.\n\nReiss Industries has not had an accidential release of any quantity of TDI within the last five years.\n\nRegular inspections of the material handling equipment and review of procedures will continue and be improved at technology advances."
