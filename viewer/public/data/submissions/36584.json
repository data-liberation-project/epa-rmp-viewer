The stationary source and the regulated substance handled\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 250,000 pounds, this would include the nurse tanks normally stored.\n3.  The accidental relrease prevention program.\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n4.  Five year accident history.\n     There have been no accidental relreases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n          -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n          -  to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property\n             damage, or environmental damage.\n5.
