Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Farmers Elevator and Exchange of Wapello, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of \n anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and propane are stored at the facility in 5 storage tanks the ammonia is stored 30,000 gallons, 18 000 gallons and 2 at  12,000 gallons.  The propane is stored in two tanks one at  18,000 gallons and the other at 30,000. \n\nThe maximum quantity stored for anhydrous ammonia is 258,000 pounds.  For the propane the maximum is 177,000 pounds stored. \n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.4 miles.  \n\n        The worst-case scenario for propane is the maximum quantity released would be             110,000 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.4            miles.\n\nb.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a relea"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.  \n    \n        The alternate release scenario for propane is a release from a hose rupture caused             by a pull-away and assumes a 25-foot length of a 4-inch transfer hose.  The active         mitigation devices are assumes to function as designed, limiting the release to the             contents of the hose.  The maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds. The             distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58. The standards listed above are referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c.    a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard \n29 CFR 1910.120, inclu"
