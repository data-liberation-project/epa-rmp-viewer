The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.  \n\nThe ETC Godley Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE    \n\nThe Godley Gas Plant is located on County Road 916 near Godley, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n1. Regulated flammable products - Natural Gas Liquids\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Godley Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 240,000 pounds (60,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in a High Pressure Surge Tank. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion that reaches the 1 psi overpressure point at 0.51 miles. The WCS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such release and to manage their consequences, passive mitigation measures include an automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and a"

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators? procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nGodley Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process. This program systematically exams for potential hazards puts controls in place to manage hazards. Process Hazard Analysis is conducted using checklists with a team of the ETC?s employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies, evaluates and makes recommendations to management of potential hazards identified. The team?s findings are forward to ETC?s Management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team?s findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee?s suggestion, compliance audit, PHAs, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\nTraining\n\nGodley Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the mean"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team?s findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nAt least every 3 years a Compliance Audit addressing all OSHA, EPA, RMP and Good Engineering Practices are conducted by employees and management of Godley Gas Plant. This audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are completed. Final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a description of existing features applicable to prevention of accidental release of regulated substances in this facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\nETC?s accident release prevention and response policies are applied to all RMP-covered processes.
