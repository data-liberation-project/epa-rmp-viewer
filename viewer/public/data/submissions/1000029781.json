      "SummaryText": "IEEC is a combined-cycle power generation facility based on two General Electric (GE) 107H gas turbines. \n\n\n\nPursuant to air quality regulations, IEEC is required to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions through the use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems that utilize aqueous ammonia (at a concentration of 29.4% by weight) as the reduction medium in the presence of a catalyst. Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic liquid under the CalARP Program. The ammonia is stored as a liquid solution, re-gasified, and injected into the SCR reaction chamber. Two 16,900-gallon (net working capacity) aboveground storage tanks are located at the facility to store the aqueous ammonia for the SCR systems (i.e., one SCR system per turbine). The two tanks are co-located within a single containment structure with an area of approximately 2216 ft2 and approximately 4.5 feet high. Since the amount of aqueous ammonia (a toxic liquid) in the process (33,800 gallons or approximately 70,980 pounds) exceeds the applicable threshold quantity listed in Tables 1 and 3 of the CalARP Program regulations, a CalARP Program is required for these processes at IEEC. Because the aqueous ammonia in the SCR systems will exceed both the Table 1 and Table 3 threshold quantities, a RMP submittal to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the Riverside County Environmental Health Department (RCEHD), which is the local Administrative Agency (AA) and the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) for IEEC. Since the aqueous ammonia concentration at IEEC is less than 44% by weight, the process is not subject to the Process Safety Management standard in 29 CFR 1910.119 and CCR Title 8, Section 5189. The process meets the Program Level 2 criteria.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nIEEC has developed operation phase mitigation measures to minimize the risks associated with handling aqueous ammonia. A worker safety plan has been implemented and inclu"

Training programs include safe operating procedures, operation and maintenance of the system, proper use of personnel protective equipment, fire safety, and emergency communication and response procedures. Plant personnel are trained in emergency procedures including plant evacuation and fire prevention. However, in the event of an emergency, plant personnel will defer to the Riverside County Hazardous Materials Team.\n\n\n\nEmergency response program\n\n\n\nIEEC is located on the border of three fire station service areas. In the event of a spill or release of a hazardous material on site, the 911 dispatcher will identify which fire station(s) will respond. a Riverside County Hazardous Materials Team (HazMat 1) will also be called to respond to any spills or releases at the site. The fire department will act as first responders in the event of a spill or release, assessing and taking action to contain the spill if possible. HazMat 1 will take command upon arrival, mitigate the spill or release, and take appropriate actions to safeguard public health and the environment. The three fire departments have a 5-minute response time for on-site spills or release. HazMat1 has a response time of 15 minutes.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, a Hazardous Materials Business Plan has been developed in accordance with CCR Title 19 and the Health and Safety Code (Section 25504).\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nThe tanks are located within a spill containment area that is designed to contain the volume of a single tank plus an allowance for precipitation from a 25-year, 24-hour storm. No other chemicals are stored within the containment area.  The aqueous ammonia storage and handling facilities are equipped with continuous tank level monitors, and a steel-reinforced concrete containment structure surrounding the tanks. Only trained technicians conduct system maintenance and repairs. IEEC"
