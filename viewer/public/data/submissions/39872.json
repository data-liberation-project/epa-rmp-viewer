If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Norwich Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis is facility is an agricultural marketer. We deliver anhydrous products to our customers. We store our anhydrous ammonia inventory in one 26,000-gallon tank.  This facility may also have up to 30 nurse tanks that could hold up to 131,070 pounds of product.  \n\nOur worst-case scenario as well as our alternate case have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns as dictated by the Homeland Security Act.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. This anhydrous ammonia system is installed and maintained in accordance with all regulations and state law.  Note:  The state of Kansas has not yet adpoted the most recent version of the ANSI standards.  When the state adopts the newest version we will committ the needed time and funds to make any needed repairs.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy (Emergency Action Plan)  to notify the Norwich Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department.  By definition we do not have an Emergency Response Plan because we require all employees to evacuate the area and call 911 immediately in the event of an accident or release of NH3.\n\nThere are no improvements needed at this time."
