Bostik-Piedmont manages the safety of the facility by designing for safe operation, by operating and maintaining the plant safely and by auditing the operations.\n\nThe facility is designed for safe operation through the use of emergency shutdown systems and alarms, fail-safe valves and dikes for the unlikely case of a potential leak.  Systems and equipment are designed to engineering standards and codes.  Safety reviews are conducted prior to start-up on all projects and process changes.\n\nThe plant is operated safely by trained and certified operators who follow standard operating procedures that contain defined safe operating limits. Routine safety meetings are held for all operating personnel and all incidents are investigated to prevent recurrence.\n\nOperational safety is maintained through preventive maintenance and equipment inspection programs.  Contractors are held to the same high safety training standards as our employees.   Operations are routinely audited for compliance with federal, state and local regulations.   Management reviews and drives resolution of all audit findings.\n\n4.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nThe Bostik Inc. facility located in Piedmont, South Carolina contains one RMP covered process which is a vinyl acetate polymer emulsions manufacturing plant.  The plant maintains greater than 10,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) to safely and efficiently manufacture polyvinyl acetate copolymer emulsions.  In the quantities handled by our facility, vinyl acetate monomer is considered to be hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations as well as our internal environmental, health and safety policies, practices and standards.\n\nBostik-Piedmont manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent safety in the design of the facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant. \nOur accident prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program rely on external agencies.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire department so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\nBostik-Piedmont is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.   The Piedmont facility is actively involved with the Piedmont Fire Department, the Greenville County LEPC and the Piedmont Community Advisory Panel.\n\n2.
