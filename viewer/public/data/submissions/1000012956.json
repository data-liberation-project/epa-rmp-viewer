      "SummaryText": "We at Oxarc, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of the regulated substance.  \"A\" and \"B\" kits are available for containment in case of a gas leak.\n\nOur facility's primary function is the production of and distribution of industrial gases.  We have the one regulated substance, chlorine, present at this location.  The maximum amount stored is 21,000 pounds stored in 150 pound cylinders and ton containers.\n\nSince chlorine is not used at our facility and valves are never opened, our accidental release prevention program centers around the proper and safe handling of cylinders or containers.  Proper equipment is provided and training such as forklift operation is documented.\n\nThere has been no accidental release during the previous five years.\n\nOxarc has a written emergency response plan to deal with the accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes provisions for notification of neighbors and emergency response agencies, evacuation, first aid and medical treatment.  The plan is updated to reflect and pertinet changes taking place.\n\nNo changes are currently planned.  We continue to look for ways to reduce the quantity of chemicals on hand."
