As a portion of the RMP/PSM program, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities has developed the following accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the use of chlorine as a disinfectant:\n\n1) Protection of public health and our employees is Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities? highest priority.\n2) Preventing the release of extremely hazardous substances is a key element of that protection.\n3) Every appropriate step will be taken to prevent these releases, including management commitment to:\n    a. Make all important information readily available.\n    b. Routinely define training to employees.\n    c.Clearly define roles and responsibilities.\n4) Fulfilling his or her roll in prevention of these releases is a condition of employment for every employee.\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of a potential release, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities has incorporated the following general accidental release prevention program and chlorine-specific prevention steps:\n\n1) Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities plant maintenance staff shall conduct routine preventative maintenance of key process  components.\n2) Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Lockout/Tagout procedures.\n3) Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Hot Work Permits.\n4) Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities maintains a routine Insp"
