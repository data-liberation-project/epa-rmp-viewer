      "SummaryText": "Southside Wastewater Treatment Plant (SSWWTP), located at 3600 Chapel Hill Road, Douglasville, GA, has one independent chlorine injection system.  The chlorine storage and chlorination process is located within two adjacent rooms comprising the chlorine process building.  The system has one (1) one-ton container of chlorine on line and one (1) one-ton container of chlorine on standby at any one time.  The system is operated under vacuum using gaseous chlorine.  There is a Vacuum Regulator-Check Unit (Wallace & Tiernan 500 lb/24 hour capacity) which automatically shuts off the cylinder in the event of a break in the vacuum line.  The chlorine supply system can automatically switch between the on-line and standby chlorine containers when the on-line container is depleted.\n\nThe facility has a chlorine detector to monitor leakage in the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms.  Chlorine sensors are located at twelve inches above floor level in both rooms.  The detector will automatically alarm at the facility and at the main control room panel. \n\nThe SSWWTP Facility normally stores a maximum of 2 one-ton cylinders at the site at any one time.  All cylinders are stored indoors in a building with doors, which seal.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area.  The building doors are opened and the chlorine cylinders are brought inside via a crane.\n\nNormally, the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms are secured with doors that remain closed and locked except when chlorine is being unloaded.  All chlorine cylinders are stored within the chlorine storage room. If a chlorine leak is detected, the chlorine alarm will sound and the Operator will notify the Plant Supervisor and appoint a Standby Operator.  The Operator and Standby will don the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and the operator will then investigate the cause for the alarm.  The Standby will remain outdoors in contact with the Operator ready to call for outside assista"

If the leakage is not stopped the Fire Department will be contacted.   The exhaust fans will be activated from the exterior of the building.  The air inside the building is evacuated and fresh air is drawn into the building through upper and lower vents respectively."
