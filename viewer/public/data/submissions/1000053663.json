They have toured our facilities and given us a hazard analysis.  We will be having drills twice yearly to familiarize the team with the equipment and procedures to be followed.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nBecause of executive support Maple Leaf Farms Serenade Foods Division maintains a comprehensive PSM program. This support allows our PSM / RMP team to have the freedom to make necessary improvements as they are identified.\r\nMaple Leaf Farms Serenade Foods Division provides certification training opportunities for employees directly and indirectly involved with the ammonia refrigeration system through courses offered by 3rd party consultants. This provides a better understanding of the operation of our ammonia refrigeration system allowing for safe operation of the system."
