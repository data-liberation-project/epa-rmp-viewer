On June 20, 1996, the USEPA finalized 40 CFR Part 68, which established the criteria of the Risk Management Plans (RMPs) required under the ARPP.  Sources covered under 40 CFR Part 68 have three (3) years from when the rule was finalized, or until June 1999, to compile data, implement a Risk Management Program and submit the RMP to USEPA.\nThe ARPP is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances.  40 CFR Part 68 regulates the accidental release of over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 of which are flammable gases.  Threshold quantity levels range from 500 pounds to 20,000 pounds.  USEPA estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.  \nThe McAllen Public Utility is responsible for developing RMPs for the regulated facilities.  City personnel are required to implement potential changes to facility operations, revise the plan in the future as required, and continue to safely meet its obligation of effectively treating water. \nUSEPA divided facilities into three categories, or Programs, depending on certain criteria.  Program 1 eligibility requires that (1) the process has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance in the previous 5 years that led to an offsite death, injury, or environmental remediation activity; (2) the distance to the toxic endpoint for a worst-case release scenario is less than the distance to a public receptor; and (3) emergency response procedures have been coordinated between t"

Expressway 83.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped to the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.  The plant is in an urban area of town that consists of both commercial and residential development.  The plant site is entirely fenced and has two points of access. \nChlorine Storage Area\nThe treatment plant consists of several buildings, including and administration building with filters, a laboratory, a main pump building, and 2 chemical buildings where chlorine is used.  Aside from the buildings, the plant has clarifiers, flocculation basins, an aerator and clearwells.  The chlorine storage area is located inside an enclosed building with a chlorine neutralizer system.\nThe plant consists of two chlorine storage areas.  The expansion plant dock houses the bulk of the chlorine containers for the plant, with ten (10) one-ton containers on-line and ten (10) one-ton containers in stand-by mode.  Both the chlorine dioxide generation system for the expansion plant and the chlorination system"

The main plant dock is smaller, with one (1) one-ton container on-line and one (1) one-ton container in standby mode, and is used solely for feeding the chlorine dioxide generation system at the main plant.  \nAt the expansion plant dock, chlorine is removed by vacuum with the use of vacuum operated regulators.  The regulators are attached to a vacuum header with individual shutoff valves and plastic tubing. The chlorine is under pressure only inside the ton containers.\nAt the main chlorine dioxide dock, vacuum regulators are directly attached to the main valve on the one-ton containers, eliminating the need for pressure piping.\nChlorine Process Areas\nBetween the containers and the vacuum regulator, the chlorine is under pressure; between the vacuum regulator and the injector, the chlorine is under a vacuum.  Four separate chlorine areas exist at the plant.  Chlorine can take three routes from the expansion dock.  The first route leads to 4 500-ppd chlorinators for the expansion plant. The second route leads to the 2000-ppd chlorinators for the main plant. These chlorinators are located in a completely enclosed room with leak detection.  The third route leads to the two 150-ppd chlorine dioxide generators for the expansion plant.  The chlorinators and chlorine dioxide generators are located in separate completely enclosed rooms with leak detection.  From the main plant chlorine dock, the chlorine is fed into the main chlorine dioxide generator building, where 2 500-ppd chlorine dioxide generators and one 150-ppd chlorine dioxide generators are located.  The chlorine can be injected into numerous feed points in the system, depending on the chlorinator/chlorine dioxide generator being used.  The amount of chlorine fed to each feed point is manually adjusted at the individual chlorinator."
