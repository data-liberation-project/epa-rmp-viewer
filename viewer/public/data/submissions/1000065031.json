(\"XTO\" or \"XTO Energy\") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of XTO's parent company Exxon Mobil Corporation (\"ExxonMobil\"), acquired BOPCO, L.P. on February 28, 2017, and XTO Energy was subsequently delegated as the asset-manager for all newly-acquired BOPCO, L.P. assets, including the Yellowcreek Natural Gas Processing Plant. As part of a voluntary audit evaluating compliance with Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r), on June 22, 2017, ExxonMobil (through XTO Energy) discovered that the Yellowcreek Natural Gas Processing Plant was not in compliance with CAA Section 112(r) and its implementing regulations found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68. On July 11, 2017, XTO Energy/ExxonMobil voluntarily disclosed the Facility's non-compliance with CAA Section 112(r) to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to EPA's New Owner Policy (73 Fed. Reg. 44,991 (Aug. 1, 2008)). Accordingly, XTO Energy/ExxonMobil is submitting the attached Risk Management Plan (RMP) to bring the Facility into compliance with CAA Section 112(r) and its implementing regulations. Consistent with EPA's New Owner Policy, XTO Energy/ExxonMobil is submitting the required RMP within sixty days from the date XTO Energy/ExxonMobil first discovered the non-compliance. For ease of use throughout this document, we refer to XTO Energy as the asset-manager for this facility.\n\n \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nXTO Energy places a strong commitment on worker safety. XTO Energy demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.

      "SummaryText": " DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Yellow Creek Gas Plant, located in Meeker, CO, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, y-grade NGL, and condensate) from natural gas. The Yellow Creek Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. There are no regulated toxic substances at the plant.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program\n\nLevel 1 processes at the Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 148,800 lbs of NGL product. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 miles. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account evaluating this WCS. No public receptors are located within the Radius of Exposure (ROE) of the WCS.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program (the \"Accident Prevention Program\") for the Yellow Creek Gas Plant.  The plant is subject to EPA's risk management program (RMP) and submits this plan in fulfillment of those requirements. \n\n\n\nProgram 1\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThis Accident Prevention Program encourages participation by employees in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation may include a range of activities from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees will have access to all information created as part of the Accident Prevention Program. In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. "

These documents will address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, will be provided in SDS sheets. The gas plant will ensure that the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe gas plant will maintain numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. The information will include materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, will provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Accident Prevention Program is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Under the program, each process will be analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe hazard analysis findings will be forwarded to corporate management for resolution.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained. Once the team's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings will be documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe plant will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. The reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The team's findings will be documented and retained and sent to corporate management for resolution.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Yellow Creek Plant will maintain written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.

Because some contractors will work on or near process equipment, the  Accident Prevention Program includes development of procedures to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find doing their work. This will be accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Yellow Creek plant will evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel will periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Yellow Creek Plant will conduct a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) performing tests, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (4) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that will maintain the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel will receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, and (4) emergency response plans to help ensure that work is performed in a safe manner. Written procedures will help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests will be performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or an engineer will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.
