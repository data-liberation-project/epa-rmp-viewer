Policies\n                Accidental Release Prevention\n\n                Any accidential release of a regulated substance would be detected by strategically located VOC monitors which would immediately alert production personnel. In addition, all drums and cylinders are leakproofness tested after filling with Ethylene Oxide. All tank cars are physically disconnected, valved off and capped during non business hours. Security fencing exists around the entire production facility.\n\n                 Emergency Response\n\n                 An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared and submitted to the Orange County LEPC and the Slate Hill Fire Department specifying response and warning system in the event of an accidential release of Ethylene Oxide. In addition, this facility conducts quarterly evacuation drills, two announced and two unannounced according to the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n       \n                 Primary activity is the repackaging of chemicals into drums and cylinders for medical sterilization businesses and for chemical synthesis customers.\n\n                 Regulated substance -  Ethylene Oxide  \n\n3. Release Scenarios\n\n                 Worst Case\n\n                 Toxic Gas\n                 Ethylene Oxide tank car rupture with release of 100% of capacity (170,00 lbs.) in 10 minutes\n\n                Alternative Release\n\n                Toxic Gas\n                Partial Ethylene Oxide hose failure at drum filling station with maximum quantity released \n                at one drum or less (400 lbs.).\n\n4. Prevention\n\n               Operations at the Slate Hill facility are operated in conformance to the OSHA Process Safety         \n               Management (PSM) standard.  .                                                                                                                    \n5.

Emergency Response Program\n\n               An Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is current with plant operations and\n               personnel. This plan includes warning and response actions in case of accidential release.\n               Evacuation drills have been conducted quarterly since 1997. A critique of each drill is\n               completed and changes made in the Plan based upon the findings from the critique.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n              Individual emergency shutoff valves for each tank car of Ethylene Oxide will be installed. These\n              valves can be remotely operated from two different locations in the event of an emergency.\n              In addition, the valve will close in the event of a fire."
