The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Wood River Terminal is coordinated with the Madison County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response"

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise, health, safety, security, environmental and team leader experience.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nDome Petroleum maintains written procedures at the Wood River Terminal that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process."

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process, discussed later in this summary.  The persons currently making periodic visits to the Wood River Terminal are trained and qualified operators at the Tuscola Terminal, a similarly operated cavern storage terminal.\n\nIn addition, the Wood River Terminal maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Dome Petroleum Corp. has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conduced at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nTh"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the terminal has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Wood River Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR)\n\nThe Wood River Terminal conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

The terminal was previously under the operatorship of Shell Corporation until 2003, when Shell discontinued the operatorship.  The terminal has been left in an out-of-service state.  All aboveground pipe systems and tankage has been drained, purged and airgapped.  We believe a quantity of propane, greater than 10,000 pounds exists within the cavern; consequently we are making application as a Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program 2 covered facility.  The facility is however exempt from the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard based on the remote and unmanned exemption. \n\nBP has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  BP's commitment to no injuries, no accidents and no harm to the environment can be seen in the manner the facility has been decommissioned and will be critical to the safe startup and commissioning of the terminal should a business need develop.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCurrently, the only in-service equipment at the Wood River Terminal is the cavern itself.  All inlets and outlets to the cavern have been flanged to contain the propane within the cavern.  As stated above, the aboveground pipe systems and tankage have all been drained, purged and airgapped, rendering them safe.  While an exact determination of propane volume cannot be determined, we estimated the volume of propane remaining within the cavern to be greater"

Currently, the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program 2.  However, upon recommissioning the facility, it will become subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) Program 3 regulation and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  This summary will address each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nCurrently the Wood River Terminal is unmanned and only receives monthly visits by trained and qualified Dome Petroleum employees based out of Tuscola, IL.  Within the Dome Petroleum employee participation plan, employees are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n\n \nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nDome Petroleum Corp. keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including expo"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  Currently, the cavern is not monitored and maintained with process controls and monitoring equipment, due to the out-of-service state.  However, upon recommissioning of the facility, Dome Petroleum Corp. will ensure that the process is maintained within appropriate limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nDome Petroleum Corp. also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nDome Petroleum Corp. has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  Prior to recommissioning the Wood River Terminal, Dome Petroleum Corp. will conduct a comprehensive PHA to identify and mitigate all hazards identified.\n\nDome Petroleum Corp. primarily uses the hazard and operability (HA"
