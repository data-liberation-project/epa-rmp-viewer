      "SummaryText": "THE MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Emerald Performance Materials chemical plant in Akron, Ohio is a specialty chemical manufacturing plant located four (4) miles south of Akron's downtown business district.  The facility is situated on a 57-acre tract of land surrounded by light industry and residences.  Of the more than 30 chemical products manufactured at the facility, 75 percent are consumed in the U.S. while the rest are sold on the international market.  This contributes significantly to the U.S. gross national product.\n\n\n\nProducts include chemicals used to prolong the life of tires, lubricating oils and electrical insulation; chemicals to toughen plastics used in automobiles and fiberglass piping; chemicals to strengthen adhesives, paper and fabrics; and chemicals to manufacture automobile gaskets, sandpaper and tapes.\n\n\n\nThe plant employs 105 employees with an annual payroll of approximately $8.0 million, paying about $140,000 in city taxes and $700,000 in county taxes annually.  Each year the facility purchases about $10.0 million in goods and services, mainly from local suppliers, and pays about $2.7 million for utilities and $2.0 million for freight services.\n\n\n\nThe plant utilizes certain chemicals as raw materials that require compliance under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These include 1,3-butadiene, 2-methylpropene and ethylene, which are flammables under the RMP; and ammonia and acrylonitrile, which are toxics under the RMP.  The programs required by the RMP to prevent serious accidents and to plant emergency contingencies have long been in place at the Emerald plant.  The company has long understood the relationship between good safety and good business, as relected by the exemplary and frequently awarded safety performance.\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the Emerald chemical plant to meet and often exceed all requirements established by "

The company safety policies and practices have historically preceeded the regulation of such practices under, for example, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule.  The company policy is to maintain at a practical minimum the potential for harm to on-site employees and contractors, the public, and the environment, and to have in place contingency actions, coordinated with local responding agencies, in the unlikely event of a serious accidental chemical release.\n\n\n\nA safety-related program in which Emerald Polymer Additives participates is ChemStewards under the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, and certification under the ISO-9000 international quality standard.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Emerald Polymer Additives plant has in place a thorough, ongoing program of Process Safety Management (PSM).  This program calls for implementation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards at the plant to minimize the likelihood of a significant release of a hazardous chemical, and to eliminate or reduce the effects of any release that might occur.  The facility has invested and continues to invest substantial effort and capital in maintaining a strong safety performance.\n\n\n\nEmployees are involved in day-to-day safety-focused activities under a program that include elelments such as:\n\n\n\n(1) Process Hazard Analysis - are routinely performed and updated.  Systematic and thorough studies of plant operations to identify what could go wrong, identify means of eliminating or reducing design or procedural weaknesses, and implementing improvements are conducted.\n\n\n\n(2) Process Design - processes and equipment are designed for safety in accordance with applicable industry standards and best engineering practices.  Designs include, as appropria"

Most processes are computer-controlled (with operator back-up), which include internal checks for abnormal conditions, emergency shutdowns, and alarm systems.  Storage vessels which contain the greatest inventories of hazardous chemicals are contained in concrete/gunnite dikes.\n\n\n\n(3) Training - operation and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on their job tasks, safe work practices as they apply to their jobs, and emergency contingency actions before they may operate or maintain equipment.  They also receive periodic refresher training.  Procedures for operating and maintaining processes, general safe work practices, and emergency response are fully documented and maintained up-to-date in light of any changes at the plant.  \n\n\n\n(4) Maintenance - each item of equipment at the plant that is involved in maintaining safety or in responding to an abnormal situation is inspected, tested, and/or maintained on a frequency that reflects its service and condition. \n\n\n\n(5) Management of Change - no change to equipment or procedural practices can take place at the plant without a thorough review of the implications of that change to safety.  No change must adversely impact the safety built into the design and operations of the processes.\n\n\n\nThe PSM program is tuned to reflect the specific hazards of the chemicals used.  For example, the operating maintenance, safe work, and emergency procedures address personal protective equipment appropriate to the chemicals being handled.  Also, equipment is selected based on its intended service and chemical exposures, including release detection devices.  \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nNovember 9, 2013 ...

New personnel are trained on the plan, annual refresher training is conducted, and any revisions to the plan incorporated into the training.  The plan is in compliance with the RMP requirements as well as other applicable EPA and OSHA requirements.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe safety program is ongoing, involving the identification and implementation of numerous means of incremental safety performance."
