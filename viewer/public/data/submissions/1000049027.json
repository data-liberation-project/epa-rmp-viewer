Our Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe ECO Services Baton Rouge, LA Facility (Baton Rouge Facility) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, hazard analysis, installation, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, management of change, incident investigation and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Baton Rouge site has also established an Emergency Response Team, consisting of plant personnel, that is well trained and prepared to respond to emergency situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Our Facility and the Regulated Substances handled\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge facility produces Sulfuric Acid including Oleum. Our facility's manufacturing activities encompass Sulfuric Acid Regeneration from Spent Acid, Oleum Production and Hazardous Waste Treatment Operations. The RMP-covered processes at our facility together handle the various regulated substances identified in this plan. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. Our General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR 68 of the EPA RMP regulations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge Facility maintains detailed records of safety information that describes the properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our manufacturing units, the process technology employed, safe oper"

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge Facility truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  The site has a written program as well as an employee-driven HS&E team leading the effort to attain 100% employee participation in HS&E improvement efforts. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP regulations, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nOn occasion, our facility hires contractors to perform specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety record of the contractor is conducted. Only those contractors who satisfy the site's selection criteria are approved for being hired.  The Baton Rouge Facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated chemical occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Our Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge Facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent accidental release prevention program and policies, there has been no reportable accidental release of regulated chemicals from our covered processes during this period. Our record reflects our safety culture and commitment to preventing accidental releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Our Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge Facility has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of haz"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including incident command system of response management, adequate first aid and medical treatment, shelter-in-place and evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas and critique of the response. The site has established an Emergency Response team consisting of plant personnel well trained and prepared to respond to emergency situations.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected, tested and serviced. Site-wide emergency preparedness drills are conducted periodically and response critiqued for improvement opportunities. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nEast Baton Rouge Parish LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge facility is committed to maintaining and operating our manufacturing units in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. Our site is committed to achieving HS&E excellence through continuous improvement of our HS&E processes. Ongoing changes to improve safety include Implementation of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), wider implementation of Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS), enhanced employee awareness of safety through improved training and education, and creating an accountability culture for safety performance."

The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are What-If and HazOp, incorporating Layers-of-Protection Analysis (LOPA).  The studies are undertaken by a cross-functional team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations and equipment maintenance, and are revalidated at a periodic interval of five years.  Any recommendations related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n \r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Baton Rouge Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is periodically reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge Facility carries out documented maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these inspections includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, heat exchangers, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
