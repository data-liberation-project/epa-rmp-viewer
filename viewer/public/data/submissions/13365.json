INTRODUCTION\n\nIn June of 1996, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued regulations requiring all industries handling regulated chemicals above threshold amounts to develop, submit, and make available to the public plans to manage the use and handling of these chemicals. This plan known as the Risk Management Plan has three components. These are listed below with a brief explanation of the requirements.\n\nHazard Assessment\nHazard Assessment describes the potential off-site consequences of a worst case scenario as well as alternate or more likely scenarios involving accidental release of regulated chemicals. This assessment consists of an estimate of potential release quantities and its potential off-site impact on people and the environment.\n\nPrevention Program\nThis section describes Uniroyal Chemical's program to identify and prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. The program includes several key elements involving: hazard identification, process safety information, training, operating instructions, employee participation, mechanical integrity, management of change, inspections, and work permits.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThis section describes actions to be taken in response to an accidental release to protect the employees, the public and the environment. The plan covers procedures for public notification and coordination with community response agencies.\n\n\nII. FACILITY OVERVIEW \n\nUniroyal Chemical Company, Inc.(Uniroyal Chemical ) manufactures specialty organic chemicals and conducts research and product development activities at its 87-acre complex, located on 280 Elm Street, Naugatuck, Connecticut. The facility is bounded by the Naugatuck River on the east, Cherry Street on the west, and the Naugatuck Water Pollution Control Facility on the south.\n\nUniroyal Chemical prod"

Our products are broadly divided into three categories; Rubber Chemicals including anti-oxidants, accelerators, bonding agents and waxes; Specialty Chemicals including lube oil additives, curatives and polymerization inhibitors; Agricultural Chemicals including miticides.  \n\nAt present, 250 full-time employees work at the Naugatuck facility and an additional 600 employees work at the corporate headquarters in Middlebury and the agricultural research station in Bethany. Uniroyal Chemical is a division of Crompton and Knowles Corporation, a $1.8 billion multi-national manufacturer of specialty chemicals, polymers and polymer processing equipment. \n\nUniroyal Chemical uses over 120 different raw materials at the Naugatuck facility. Of these, twelve (12) are RMP regulated chemicals and three (3) are stored in tanks in quantities above the RMP regulated Threshold Quantities (TQ), requiring Uniroyal Chemical to prepare the Risk Management Plan.  These chemicals are Ethyl Chloride, Carbon Disulfide and Phosphorus Trichloride.   \n\n\nII. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nUniroyal Chemical considers the health and safety of the public, its employees, and customers and the protection of the environment to be of primary importance in the conduct of its business.

With members from a broad cross-section of the community and Uniroyal Chemical's Naugatuck facility, the CAP has met regularly and discussed various topics of mutual interest including environmental protection. Uniroyal Chemical reviewed the RMP rule as well as its Risk Management Plan with the CAP several times and obtained their valuable input. Uniroyal Chemical also met with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and reviewed the Plan. Uniroyal Chemical arranged for a public meeting to review its RMP with the public, invited the press and placed several advertisements in the local newspapers announcing the public meeting. Uniroyal Chemical prepared a brochure describing the RMP, provided details of off-site consequences, and described Uniroyal Chemical's prevention program and the emergency response plan. Uniroyal Chemical met with the public, press and the Town leaders on June 15, 1999 and explained the RMP and answered questions. Copies of this brochure were distributed to the public at the meeting.\n\n\nIII. REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAs described earlier, Uniroyal Chemical uses over 120 different raw materials at the Naugatuck facility. Of these, twelve (12) are RMP regulated chemicals** and three (3) are stored in tanks in quantities above the RMP regulated Threshold Quantities (TQ), requiring Uniroyal Chemical to prepare the Risk Management Plan.

Measures have been put in place (through operating procedure, verification of inventory before ordering materials, training of personnel, verification before material is loaded into the storage tanks, etc.) to ensure that the maximum inventory of nine of the twelve chemicals is limited to less than their respective TQs.  The maximum inventory of the remaining three RMP chemicals are also limited to reduce the distance of potential off-site impact caused by a hypothetical accidental release of these chemicals.\n \n\nIV. RESULTS OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe following is a summary of the results of the Hazard Assessment and Consequence Analysis calculated for hypothetical release incidents involving ethyl chloride (flammable substance) and carbon disulfide (toxic). Uniroyal Chemical used EPA's RMPComp accidental release model to evaluate the consequence of a worst-case release. An example of a worst-case scenario would be where an accident resulted in the instantaneous release of all the contents of a tank.  An alternate scenario would consist of an incident where a process pipeline gasket or pipe was leaking for 10 minutes before being stopped and repaired.\n\nCarbon disulfide( CS2) is stored in a 12,000gallon stainless steel storage tank. Up to 126,000 pounds of carbon disulfide could be stored in this tank. As described above, Uniroyal Chemical is limiting the maximum on-site inventory of CS2 to 80,000 pounds. The CS2 storage tank is located underwater inside a concrete dike and the CS2 itself is stored under a water blanket within the storage tank. Any transfer of CS2 from the storage tank to the process area is achieved by the displacement of CS2 with water. These storage and transfer conditions prevent any releases of CS2 into the dike from contacting the outside environment. CS2 is heavier "

The released CS2 would sink to the bottom of the containment dike and be recovered by vacuuming or pumping, with minimal actual emissions to the environment.\n\nWhile it is very unlikely that the storage tank would rupture and release all its contents at once, and it is even more unlikely that all the water in the dike (the CS2 storage tank is located underwater) would be drained and not be available to blanket any spilled CS2, Uniroyal Chemical is required to consider this scenario by the regulations and evaluate its consequences. In the unlikely event of such a release, the entire contents of the CS2 storage tank will be contained with in the concrete dike. Additionally, the dike serves to limit the exposed surface area of the spilled material, thus reducing the rate of CS2 release to the environment.  The consequences of a Worst-case and an Alternative Scenario involving a release of CS2 are presented in Table-1. Each of the release scenarios described above (both worst-case and alternative) would result in off-site impacts.\n\nEthyl Chloride (EC) is stored under pressure in a steel tank capable of storing 15,000 gallons (112,500 lbs). As described earlier, Uniroyal Chemical is limiting (through administrative controls) the maximum on-site inventory of EC to 70,000 pounds. The EC tank is located with in a concrete dike and the tank system is provided with a water deluge system, which would be automatically deployed if a fire were to occur. The consequences of a Worst-case and an Alternative Scenario involving a release of EC are presented in Table-1. While the quantities involved in a hypothetical worst-case and the alternative release scenarios are the same, the off-site consequence of the releases are very different.

As described earlier, Uniroyal Chemical is limiting (through administrative controls) the maximum on-site inventory of PCl3 to 80,000 pounds.  The PCl3 tank is located with in a concrete dike. The containment area is capable of containing the entire contents of the tank and serves to limit the exposed surface area of the pool of any spilled material, thus reducing the release rate to the environment.  In addition to the containment dike, the tank, containment dike and the majority of the associated piping are fully enclosed by an air-tight structure that further reduces the release rate of Phosphorous Trichloride to the environment by over 95% for both worst-case and alternative release scenarios. With the construction of the enclosing structure the off-site consequence of a potential PCl3 release has been significantly reduced.    \n   \nAs mentioned earlier, the regulations require that the worst-case scenario be evaluated.

IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we would control and contain the release in a manner that prevents injury to our employees, the public and the environment.  We would keep the fire department informed and request assistance as required. We would also provide notification to all pertinent agencies. \n\nAny notification to the public will be made through the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) / Fire Department. Unless instructed otherwise, in an emergency:\n\n- Stay indoors and await notification from LEPC\n- Close the windows and shut-off air conditioners to minimize potential exposure\n- Wear full shirts and pants (cover as much skin as practicable)."

      "SummaryText": "based on very conservative EPA-required guidelines and assumptions.  Although it is extremely unlikely that a Worst-Case situation will occur, it serves to draw attention to the chemicals and how associated risks are managed.  The Alternative Release Scenario is developed by the facility and focuses on a more likely situation.  Current safeguards at Uniroyal Chemical are designed to make the chances of experiencing even the \"Alternative Release Scenario\" unlikely.   This information is, however, useful in developing our prevention and emergency response plans.  \n\nThe Uniroyal Chemical facility in Naugatuck has not had an RMP-defined chemical release in the past five years, and has been handling these chemicals safely at this facility for over 40 years.\n\n\nV. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nUniroyal Chemical has practiced incident prevention through safe design and safe practice long before the RMP regulations were issued.\n \n7 In order to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release, our equipment, facilities, and processes are carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained. \n7 To ensure safe operation of the plant we rely upon our employees who are knowledgeable, well trained and equipped.   \n7 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) reviews are conducted on an ongoing basis and specifically before the start-up of a new process.\n7 Our employees are trained in process safety information, operating instructions, internal safety-permit requirements, and management of change (MOC) procedures. This ensures that all employees are well informed and understand their duties.\n7 Our mechanical integrity program includes regular inspections and testing of equipment. This includes visual internal and external inspections, mechanical testing such as pressure testing, ultrasonic and magnetic testing, and preventive maintenance activities such as scheduled safety valve check-up and pump replacements.\n\n\nVI.
