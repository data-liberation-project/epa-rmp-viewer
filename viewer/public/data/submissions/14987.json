      "SummaryText": "The City of Batavia currently operates a wastewater treatment facility with a design flow of 3.65 million gallons per day.  The facility currently disinfects its effluent with chlorine using a gas based injection system that is fed by one-ton cylinders.  Each vessel is capable of containing a maximum of 2,000 lbs of chlorine gas.\n\nThe plant is to be expanded within the next two years to treat a design flow of 4.20 million gallons per day.  The expansion will also include the installation of a ultra-violet disinfection system that will eliminate the need for the one-ton cylinders.  The construction for this portion of the project is expected to be completed by June 2000."
