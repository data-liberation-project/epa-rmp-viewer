Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a living document. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Vie-Del Company Fresno has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Vie-Del Company Fresno, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Vie-Del Company Fresno has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name          | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nNorth System            Anhydrous Ammonia           20,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. \r\n\r\nOverall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalAR"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\r\n\r\n1.2 Process Descriptions\r\nVie-Del Company Fresno is a processor of fruit juice, concentrate, wine and spirits. Normal operations are Monday through Friday, and can vary from 9 to 24 hours per day.The exception is the grape crushing season that typically lasts from August through November of each year.

Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the heat exchanger.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator (or shell of the heat exchanger), and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator where residual liquid can be separated from the vapor. From there the"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nVie-Del Company Fresno has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Vie-Del Company Fresno continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Vie-Del Company Fresno's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nVie-Del Company Fresno has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Vie-Del Company Fresno has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Vie-Del Company Fresno now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Vie-Del Company Fresno employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Vie-Del Company Fresno will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
