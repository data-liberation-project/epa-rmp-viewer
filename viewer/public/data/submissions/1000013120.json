The scope of the RMP includes all operations conducted at the subject site that involve the storage and handling of regulated substances.  Regulated substances stored and handled at the facility include:\n\n    Hydrofluoric acid (70-percent concentration); and\n    Formaldehyde (37-percent concentration).\n\nEach of these materials is handled in varying container sizes.  \n\n1.1    DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe primary operation conducted by Gallade Chemical, Inc. at the Santa Ana Facility is Chemical Distribution (NAICS Code 42489 A? Other Chemical and Allied Products Merchant Wholesalers).\n  \n1.1.1    FACILITY LOCATION\nThe Gallade Chemical Facility is located at 1230 East St. Gertrude Place in Santa Ana, California 92707.  The Facility is located in an area that is primarily industrial and bounded by East St. Gertrude Place to the north and industrial facilities to the east, south and west.  Figure 2-1 presents a General Facility Location Map for the site.\n\n1.1.2    FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nGallade ChemicalA?s Santa Ana Facility was constructed in 1973 to distribute industrial chemicals to retail operators and wholesale distributors.  \n\n1.1.3    DESCRIPTION OF REGULATED SUBSTANCE STORAGE AND HANDLING\nGallade ChemicalA?s Santa Ana Facility is a chemical distribution facility.  As part of normal operations, the Facility purchases, receives and stores onsite a number of regulated substances either in bulk or in various pre-packaged container types and sizes.

As orders are received, the containers of Formaldehyde are shipped out to the various customer sites.\n\n1.2    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at the facility consists of a series of programs, procedures and policies designed to minimize the risk of accidental releases involving regulated substances.  These programs include design and operating controls such as compliance with specified codes (i.e. compliance with building codes and fire codes, conformance to the Chemical ManufacturerA?s AssociationA?s Responsible Care Program, Corporate policies for segregation of classes of hazardous substances such as strong acids, strong bases, weak acids, weak bases, etc.), the CompanyA?s OSHA Hazard Communication Program, the CompanyA?s Injury and Illness Prevention Program, numerous standard operating procedures, the equipment inspection and maintenance program (including a mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance program for forklifts, etc.), fire protection, accident/incident investigation procedures (as contained in the CompanyA?s Injury and Illness Prevention Program), emergency response plan, the CalARP RMP Program compliance auditing program, and a variety of personnel training programs.

Onsite deaths, injuries, or \nA?    Significant property damage; or\nA?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n1.4    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nGallade Chemical recognizes that emergency planning and emergency response are an integral component of risk management.   As such, the Company, as part of its hazardous materials business plan (HMBP) for the Santa Ana Facility, has currently developed and implemented an emergency response plan and an emergency evacuation plan.  However, as an added measure to improve safety, the Company is evaluating the feasibility of developing specific emergency response options for emergencies involving various classes of hazardous substances handled at the facility (including regulated substances).  \n\n1.5    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nA detailed process hazards analysis was performed for the facility on ALL operations involving regulated substances stored and handled at the facility in order to enhance the safety of the site and to evaluate the potential for accidental releases.  As a result of the process hazards analysis performed, a number of recommendations were made.  Gallade Chemical has already completed and implemented a number of the recommended actions.  \n\n1.6    COMPANY CONTACT INFORMATION\nGallade Chemicals, Inc. recognizes that some individuals may be interested in obtaining more detailed information regarding the CalARP RMP and various Prevention Program components not discussed herein.
