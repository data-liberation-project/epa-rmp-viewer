The Water Department is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees. Section Safety Supervisors are tasked with the implementation of the safety programs and policies at the pump station. In addition, the Department has an Accident Review Committee that is responsible for reviewing all incidents and near misses that occur at the facilities. This group is responsible for collecting all necessary information from employees (and contractors as necessary) regarding a reported incident through interview sessions. Following the data collection, the Accident Review Committee will meet to hypothetical potential causes and develop mitigation measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system and storage for the James M. Rez Pump Station of City of Glendale Water and Power is located at 1111 East Glenoaks Boulevard in Glendale, California.  \n\n\n\n**James Rez Pump Station - Chlorine System\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at James Rez Pump Station of City of Glendale Water and Power is used for the chlorination of drinking water from the MWDG-1 Connection in the City of Glendale.  The James Rez Pump Station uses chlorine for odor control, filamentous control, and disinfection of water from Glorietta Reservoir.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored for the chlorination process is 4,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe James Rez Pump Station's chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  In the chlorine storage room at the James Rez Pump Station, two (2) one-ton chlorine containers are maintained on-line.  While connected to the system, two one-ton containers are placed on a scale to allow City of Glendale Water and Power operators to monitor the usage and plan ahead for order"

The vacuum regulator/heater assembly is placed on the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas is pulled from the container. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine gas is pulled from the one-ton container to the chlorinator through the vacuum regulator.  A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the injector.  This flow generates a vacuum (approximately 1-3 in. Hg) which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line from any one-ton container, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine from escaping. Any chlorine gas in the tubing upon loss of vacuum, downstream of the regulator, will be drawn through the ejectors and into solution.  \n\n\n\nAfter passing through the vacuum regulator, the chlorine gas is sent to a chlorinator.  The chlorinator is equipped with a rotameter to regulate the amount of chlorine that flows to the injectors.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinator, the chlorine gas is drawn to the injector located in the chlorinator room and is mixed with water to produce chlorine solution.   At the mixing point of chlorine and water, the solution becomes sufficiently diluted to no longer merit concern.\n\n\n\n**James Rez Pump Station Storage Location\n\n\n\nVarious pump stations throughout the City of Glendale use 150-pound chlorine cylinders to treat the drinking water.  The 150-pound cylinders are delivered to the James Rez Pump Station Storage Location, where Water personnel receive the delivery.  The 150-pound cylinders are stored at the James Rez Pump Station Storage Location until they are needed at another City of Glendale facility.\n\nA maximum of 20 150-pound cylinders (3,000 lbs) is maintained at the James Rez Pump Station.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of c"

This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at James Rez Pump Station employed by the Glendale Water & Power is equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential chlorine related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations.  This monitoring system is comprised of excess flow valves, pressure indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility operators to effectively monitor and control operations.\n\n\n\nThe Glendale Water & Power maintains tight control of its chlorine processes through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are three mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine sensor / detector and 2) alarms.\n\n\n\nThere are three chlorine detectors where one is located at the one-ton containers Chlorine Storage Room, one at the 150-pound cylinders Storage, and one at the Injection Room.  At 1 ppm, the chlorine sensors will trigger a visual alarm located in the chlorine storage room and the chlorinator room.  Once a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm is detected by the sensors, the chlorine alarm system will notify operators (by sending a text message to all operator's phone) of the chlorine leak through the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.  The chlorine alarm system also will circulate the air in the building.\n\n\n\nAn automatic switchover function on the vacuum regulator allows only one of the two containers to feed chlorine at a time.  When the vacuum regulator detects high vacuum from one of the containers, it opens to supply chlorine from the other container. The heater is used to ensure that chlorine does not condense.

Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the James Rez Pump Station's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study (May 7, 2014), there have been no significant releases of chlorine at the facility that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds in the last five years (May 2009 to May2014) or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of hazardous material for the Five-Year Accident History at the facility.   \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.

The Revalidation was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the chlorine system since the previous HAZOP Revalidation study, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the 2009 PHA Revalidation study, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, the completion of chlorine checklists, and the completion of the HAZOP log tables.  The recommended changes are scheduled to be completed by May 2015.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the mitigation measures included in the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, the Process Safety Management team continues to ensure employee involvement in Safety Plan Development and training requirement protocol.
