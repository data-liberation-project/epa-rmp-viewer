Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility handles chlorine which is considered a hazardous material.  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility\u0012s workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility\u0012s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility treats surface water obtained from reservoirs for municipal and industrial uses.  This water is disinfected by mixing chlorine gas and water.  There are facilities to utilize two (2) one ton containers of chlorine on-line,  two (2) one ton containers of chlorine on standby, and storage for eight (8) one ton containers of chlorine in the Chlorine Storage Room of the Operations Building.  Chlorine gas from the on-line containers is piped into the chlorinators located in the Chlorination Room, which is next door to the Chlorine Storage Room.  The chlorine gas is piped from the chlorinators down to the water injectors in the Basement Room of the Operations Building which is below the Chlorine Storage room and Chlorination Room.\n\nThere is a daily maximum of 24,000 lb of chlorine at the facility.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe largest storage vessel is a one ton container of chlorine.  Failure of this container will release 2,000 lb of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire 2,000 lb is released as gas in ten minutes.  The one ton container is stored in a room inside of a building but the assumption is made that the gas release from the one ton container is directly to the surrounding atmospher"

Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe largest storage vessel is a one ton container of chlorine.  Complete failure of the line from the valve on the one ton container at that valve was assumed to occur.  The chlorine release from the one ton container is to the atmosphere of the room in which the one ton \n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenario (Continued)\n\ncontainer is located.  The atmosphere of the room is vented to the surrounding atmosphere external to the room by an exhaust fan which is initiated by the sensing of the release.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm for the Alternative Release scenario will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine system and the training provided to the chlorine system operators.\n\n3d. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing,  and maintenance of the chlorine system and its related equipment and components. \n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents one of the facility\u0012s main active c"

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere was an accidental release of an estimated 2.3 to 3.6 lb of chlorine on February 16, 1993.  All of the release was considered to stay onsite.  There was no persons injured onsite or offsite due to the release.  There was no property damage onsite or offsite due to the release.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Stockton Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The County of San Joaquin - Office of Emergency Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 4 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the State of California\u0012s Risk Management Prevention Program (RMPP) that are being implemented at this time for the next year.  Current applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the chlorine system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBAAG2197.DBC-W50"
