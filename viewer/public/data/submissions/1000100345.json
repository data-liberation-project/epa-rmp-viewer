      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nBuffalo Water Treatment Plant managed by Veolia Water utilizes chlorine to disinfect raw water for the purpose of providing a potable water source to the City of Buffalo. The chlorination system is designed to provide a metered flow of chlorine from six, one-ton containers equipped with automatic switchover equipment. There can be up to twenty-four, one-ton containers on site including empty cylinders (approximately 48,000 pounds of chlorine if all cylinders were full) at the facility. Flow from the one-ton containers is directed through flexible tubing into a hard piping system. The system operates under a positive pressure flow and can be isolated at three points. The three points are the container valves, the header valves, and the vaporizer valves. Under normal conditions, the chlorination system draws from the six one-ton containers simultaneously through a main header system. There are two scales, each containing six, one-ton containers on trunnions, and the automatic switchover system controls the scale from which chlorine is drawn. \r\n\r\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \r\nThe Buffalo Water Treatment Plant endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to its employees, customers, and the community by providing employees educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers both on and off the job. The Buffalo Water Treatment Plant's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of chlorine into locations that could potentially expose employees and the community to serious hazards.\r\n\r\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of these Chlorine safety programs. \r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\nChlorine is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. \r\n\r\nC.
