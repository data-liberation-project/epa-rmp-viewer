The policy complies with all pertinent procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The City of Dunedin emergency response policy involes the preparation of site specific response plans, taking into consideration the available emergency response services surrounding each facility. The emergency response policy is in accordance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe Dunedin Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located at 1140 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue in the City of Dunedin Florida.  The WWTP employs advanced secondary treatment processes to remove solids and contaminates from wastewater and produce a high quality treated effluent.  The final treatment process involves the treatment of the effluent with chlorine and the dechlorination of the disinfected effluent with sulfur dioxide prior to discharge.  The primary mode of discharge is into the City's reclaimed water system. If for any reason the effluent can not be discharged to the reclaimed system , the backup disposal method is via surface water discharge to St. Joseph's Sound. Disinfection and dechlorination of all water to be discharged to surface waters is mandated by Florida Department of Environmental Protection rules and is necessary to prevent waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery and to protect aquatic ecosystems. \n\nThe WWTP is equipped with remote detectors connected to a control room and a leak detection system which activates audio and visual alarms. Safety kits, self containing breathing apparatuses, and response equipment is located on site to swiftly deal with the first stages of chemical handling. The facility is staffed 24 hours per day, seven days per week with Operators licensed by the State of Florida. Standard Operating Procedures along with regular chemical handling and in-ho"

      "SummaryText": "use safety training is provided to all operators.\n\nThe offsite consequences analysis takes into consideration a \"worst-case release\" for chlorine and an \"alternative release scenario\" for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The \"worst-case release\" is defined by the EPA as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance (chlorine gas) from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint\".  The \"alternative scenario\" is defined as the \"more probable\" senario of a failure, than is the \"worst-case release\" The worst-case release senario at the Dunedin WWTP involves the release of one one-ton cylinder of chlorine (2000 lbs.) outdoors. Based on EPA's RMP*Comp model, the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release senario is 0.9 miles. The alternate release senario at the Dunedin WWTP involves a relief valve failure. Based on EPA's RMP*Comp model, the distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release senario is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe City of Dunedin accidental release prevention program consist of the following elements:\n\n1. A preventive maintenance program that follows manufacter's specifications and acceptable engineering practices.\n2. On-going and continuous training of plant personnel.\n3. Use of current Operations and Maintenance manuals.\n4. Continued equipment inspections and compliance audits.\n5. The inplementation of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\nThe Dunedin WWTP facility has reported two accidental releases of chlorine over the past five (5) years. Both events were minor and less than 20 lbs.combined release without causing, injury, or property damage. These events were discovered by plant personnel and related to failure of the suppliers storage containers delivered to the plant site. Operating procedures were revised to include a more stringent inspection of delivered chlorine cylinders.\n\nThe Dunedin WWTP facility has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated "
