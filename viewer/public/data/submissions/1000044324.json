              "Description": "The City of Alice's Southside Wastewater Treatment Plant (SSWWTP) stores and uses chlorine to disinfect the community water supply.  The SSWWTP maintains approximately 4,000 pounds (two 1-ton containers) of chlorine on-site for use in its chlorination/disinfection process.  This process is considered a single process and everything in SSWWTP?s prevention program applies to this process.\n\n\n\nThe SSWWTP includes seven basic elements in its prevention program: a safety program, a hazard review program, written operating and maintenance procedures, a training program, incident investigation procedures, and a compliance audit program to ensure effectiveness of the risk management program.\n\n\n\nSafety\n\nThe SSWWTP maintains complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment.  The safety program consists of written information complied for the chlorination process and up-to-date safety information, enabling the SSWWTP operators to identify and understand the potential hazards involved in the covered process. The operating procedures are consistent with process safety information and include steps for each phase of the chlorination process, operating limitations and safety and health considerations.\n\n\n\nHazard Review\n\nThe SSWWTP has a hazard review process is to determine, identify, and evaluate the types of hazards or potential failures associated with the chlorination/disinfection process.  To ensure that the identification of hazards is as complete as possible, a Hazard Review checklist and What-If Analysis have been designed for use in conducting a Hazard Review of the SSWWTP.  Any problems that are identified by the Hazard Review are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent Hazard Review was conducted on 04/28/2014.  A Hazard Review is conducted at least once every five years or whenever a major change in the process occurs.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures have been developed for the SSWWTP which provide safe and appropriate step-by-step method for conducting safe operations.  The written operating procedures give operators clear instructions for safely operating the chlorination/disinfection process.  These operating procedures include guidance from manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors of the chlorination process equipment. Operating Procedures are updated as necessary, whenever there is a change in the chlorination process or when there are suggested improvements.  The SSWWTP Plant Superintendent will review and approve any new or revised Operating Procedures.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Procedures\n\nTo ensure that maintenance operations are conducted in a safe manner and implemented to maintain the mechanical integrity of the chlorination equipment, the maintenance procedures program includes written procedures and schedules for maintenance and equipment inspections and tests.  Inspections are conducted daily by trained plant operators. Complete comprehensive maintenance is conducted by contractors annually or biannually.  Any contractors used at the Treatment Plant will be required to enter into agreements assuring that only trained workers will be sent to the Treatment Plant.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe SSWWTP's training program is in-place to ensure that its operators understand how to safely operate the chlorination equipment and to understand why safe operations are necessary.  Every employee working with the chlorine will be adequately trained to ensure safe handling, storage, and use of the chlorine.  All personnel working at the SSWWTP receive training on the operation and maintenance procedures of the chlorination/disinfection process.  Training consists of one-on-one training, on-the-job training, and classroom training.  Training is conducted throughout the year at monthly safety meetings.  Comprehensive refresher training, covering all activities involving the chlorination process, is conducted at least once every three year and more often if necessary.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe SSWWTP has developed incident investigation procedures to investigate major and minor accidents that occur within the plant or across the fence line that resulted in or could have resulted in a chemical release, personnel injury, property damage, or environmental damage.  This process has been developed to enable the SSWWTP to prevent similar incidents and more serious accidents from occurring and encourages learning from past experiences.  Incident investigations will be initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nThe SSWWTP has implemented a compliance audit program to periodically assess compliance with its risk management program.  When conducting Compliance Audits, the detailed Compliance Audit Checklist will be used.   Risk Management Program Compliance Audits will be conducted, at a minimum, every three years.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe SSWWTP is a NON-RESPONDING facility and has developed an Emergency Action Plan.  This Emergency Action plan is designed to ensure that system for notifying employees, the surrounding community, and the proper response authorities of in the event of an accidental release of hazardous chemicals is effective and in-place. The SSWWTP operators are not trained nor equipped to respond, other than an incidental response, to a hazardous chemical release.  In the event that a release occurs that requires any response other than an incidental response, which can be safely performed by the City of Alice operators, the City of Alice Fire Department (or other trained emergency response contractor) will be contacted. The City of Alice Fire Department has been trained to respond to chlorine release.\n\n\n\nManagement Program\n\nThe management program was developed to ensure that the elements of the risk management plan are integrated, implemented, continuously improved, and that the responsibility for the overall program and for each RMP requirement is clearly defined.  The City of Alice has a well-defined organizational structure for ensuring the implementation of the RMP requirements and each of the specific RMP elements.  The City of Alice?s Assistant Director of Public Works is responsible for overall implementation of the Risk Management Program.  In addition, a support team, comprised of personnel from the Wastewater Treatment Plant, has been established to support implementing the RMP.  \n\n",
