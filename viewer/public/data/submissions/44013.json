Copies of the written program are on file at the main office and may be obtained from Fred Pearson.\n\nUnder this program, you will be informed of the contents of the Hazard Communication Standard, the hazardous properties of products with which you work, safe handling procedures, and measures to take to protect yourselves from these products. You will also be informed of hazards associated with other tasks.\n\nList of Hazardous Chemicals\n\nManagement will make a list of all hazardous chemicals used in our facilities and will update the list as necessary. The list of chemicals identifies all of the chemicals used in our facilities.  A separate list is available for each work area and is posted in each specific work area. Each list also identifies the corresponding MSDS for each chemical. A master list of all chemicals will be maintained at the main office and is available from the program coordinator.\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS?s)\n\nMSDS?s provide you with specific information on the chemicals we use at our facilities. Management will maintain a binder in the office with an MSDS on every substance on the l"

The MSDS will be a fully completed OSHA Form 174 or equivalent. \n\nThe manager will ensure that each work site maintains an MSDS for hazardous materials in that area. MSDS?s will be made readily available to each employee at their work station during their shifts. \n\nManagement is responsible for acquiring and updating MSDS?s.\n\nManagement will contact the chemical manufacturer or supplier if additional research is necessary or if an MSDS has not been supplied with an initial shipment. A master list of MSDS?s is available at the office.\n\nLabels and Other Forms of Warning\n\nManagement will ensure that all hazardous chemicals in the workplace are properly labeled and updated as necessary. Labels should list at least the chemical identity, appropriate hazard warnings, and the name and address of the manufacturer, importer or other responsible party. Management will refer to the corresponding MSDS to assist you in verifying label information. Containers that are shipped from the workplace will be checked by Management to make sure all containers are properly labeled.\n\nIf there are a number of stationary containers within a work area that have similar contents and hazards, signs will be posted on them to alert employees to hazard information.  On our stationary process equipment, regular process sheets, batch tickets, and similar written materials will be substituted for container labels when they contain the same information as labels.  These written materials will be made readily available to employees during their work shift. \n\nIf you transfer chemicals from labeled containers to a portable container that is intended only for your immediate use, no label is required on the portable container.  Pipes or piping systems will not be labeled but their contents will be described in a training session.\n\nNon-Routine Tasks\n\nWhen you are required to perform hazardous non-routine tasks (e.g. cleaning tanks, entering confining spaces, etc.), a special tra"

A program that uses available materials has been prepared for this purpose. Whenever a new hazard is introduced, additional training will be provided.  Regular safety meetings will also be used to review the information presented in the initial training. Department managers and other supervisors will be extensively trained regarding hazards and appropriate protective measures so they will be available to answer questions from employees and provide daily monitoring of safe work practices. \n\nThe training plan will emphasize these items:\n\n?    Summary of the standard and this written plan.\n?    Chemical and physical properties of hazardous materials and methods that can be used to detect the presence or release of chemicals.\n?    Physical hazards of chemicals (e.g. potential for fire, explosion, etc.).\n?    Health hazards, including signs and symptoms of exposure, associated with exposure to chemicals and any medical condition known to be aggravated by exposure to the chemical.\n?    Procedures to protect against hazards (e.g., personal protective equipment required, proper use, and maintenance; work, practices or methods to assure proper use and handling of chemicals; and procedures for emergency response.\n?    Work procedures to follow to assure protection when cleaning hazardous chemical spills and leaks.\n?    Where MSDS?s are located, how to read and interpret the information on both labels and MSDS?s, and how employees may obtain additional hazard information. \n\nManagement will review our employee training program and advise the General Manager on training and retraining needs.

As part of the assessment of the training program, the safety and health manager will obtain input from employees regarding the training they have received, and their suggestions for improving it. \n\nContractor Employers\n\nManagement will advise outside contractors in person of any chemical hazards that may be encountered in the normal course of their work on the premises, the labeling system in use, the protective measures to be taken, and the safe handling procedures to be used.  In addition, the coordinator will notify these individuals of the location and availability of MSDS?s. Each contractor bringing chemicals on-site must provide us with the appropriate hazard information on these substances, including the labels used and the precautionary measures to be taken in working with these chemicals.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAll employees, or their designated representatives, can obtain further information on this written program, the hazard communication standard, applicable MSDS?s, and chemical information lists from Management."
