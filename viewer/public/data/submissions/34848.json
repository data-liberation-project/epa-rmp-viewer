Per 29 CFR 1910, a Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) has been developed and implemented to prevent and minimize the release of specified chemicals including sulfur dioxide. This plan protects both onsite workers and the public.\n    B. Local officials and emergency service deparments have reviewed the factory Risk Management Plan and Emergency Preparedness and Contingency Plan (EPCP).\n    C. Accidental releases will be reported per the Emergency Planning Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA 302 & 355).\n    D. Minor leaks (e.g., leaking fitting) will be addressed by factory personnel using our Standard Operating Procedures for SO2.\n    E. Nyssa Rural Fire Department will be notified in the event of a reportable release.\n2. Stationary source & hazardous material handled.\n    A. Stationary source is a railcar.\n    B. Material is anhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2), liquidified under pressure.\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n    A. PSM has been implemented as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.\n    B. Emergency railcar capping kit is onsite to isolate any leaking railcar fittings or valves.\n    C. Remote control solenoid valves have been installed at several locations on SO2 transfer lines. In event of a leak, these valves can be triggered to isolate both the railcar and sections of the transfer piping.\n    D. To minimize the possibility of leaks, the main transfer line is constructed of 3/4'' SS pipe with socket weld joints.\n    E. Depending on ambient temperatures, liquid spills forming puddles may be neutralized using calcuim carbonate available onsite.\n    F. Risk management program has been discussed with local officials and emergency service departments.\n    G. Automatic process controls are in place to minimize accidental releases due to equipment failure.\n    H. SO2 railcars are only onsite during beet processing campaigns which"
