      "SummaryText": "R & W Fertilizer is a small retailer of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Storage capacity is a 30,000 gallon storage tank.  It is our policy that safety is first and foremost not only for employees, but for the local community and surrounding rural community.  The facility is inspected regularily by employees.  All maintenance and repairs are performed immediately.  The plant was located 5 miles from the nearest town because of safety concerns.  It is located in a low lying area.  In the event of a worst case leak the local fire department will coordinate with the williams county sheriffs office for evacuation of local residents.  Quantity released, temperature and wind direction will determine the proper response.  In the case of a small leak the employees, possibly assisted by the fire department will handle these.  In either case there are emergency shut off devices in place to take care of most anything short of a tornado.  The main storage tank has relief valves for overpressurization.  Intake lines have emergency shut off valves.  Station valves have overpressurization slam valves, and emergency shut off valves.  Although the chance of a major leak are very slim it does happen and these leaks may affect water supplies.  To date there has never been a release of any kind, and an emergency shut down has never taken place.  The local fire department regularily visits and discusses different scenarios in case of a release.  As of now no changes are planned."
