The capacity of the system exceeds 10,000 pounds.  Nashville Glass Plant and Air Products minimize the risks associated with the hydrogen system by:\n\n1. Implementing procedures that minimize releases during the delivery and storage of hydrogen,\n2. Employee training, and\n3. Limiting access to the system.\n\nTo further minimize the risks associated with the hydrogen system, Nashville Glass Plant has:\n\n1.  Implemented inspection and corrective action procedures established under Nashville Glass Plant's Environmental Management System (ISO 14001) program, and\n2.  Planning and training for response to an emergency.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED [40 CFR 68.155(b)]\nNashville Glass Plant is a glass manufacturing facility that produces automotive and flat glass for Ford Motor Company.\n\nThe storage of hydrogen at Nashville Glass Plant is limited to one 18,000 gallon liquid hydrogen storage tank, a vaporizer and the associated piping.  Although the capacity of the storage tank is limited by administrative controls to approximately 9,500 pounds, the entire capacity of the system exceeds 10,000 pounds.  Hydrogen is used in the tin bath operations of glass manufacturing.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEA"

      "SummaryText": "SE SCENARIOS [40 CFR 68.155(c)]\nAs required by EPA guidance, the worst-case release was determined for the release of the entire contents of the storage tank followed by a vapor cloud explosion. To determine the amount of hydrogen released in the worst-case scenario, the administrative control on the capacity of the storage tank was considered.  The distance to the endpoint for vapor cloud explosions (i.e., 1 psi) extends beyond the Nashville Glass Plant property line.  However, Nashville Glass Plant, in conjunction with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., minimizes the possibility of this type of release from occurring through the accidental release prevention program that has been established.  The reported potential population affected by the worst-case release scenario represents a best estimate based on the available census data.  Based on a survey of the vicinity of the plant, Nashville Glass Plant believes that the value in Section 4.7 of this submittal overstates the potentially affected population.\n\nA number of alternative release scenarios were identified.  The one that appears to be the most useful, for the responders, is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from a break in a liquid delivery line in direct connection with the storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint for this scenario does not extend off-site.  No mitigating factors were considered in the evaluation of the alternative release scenarios. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM [40 CFR 68.155(d)]\nThe Nashville Glass Plant has developed and uses routine inspection and operational controls to prevent accidents.  Specific prevention steps are listed in the Air Products PSM and Customer Manuals and in the Nashville Glass Plant Contingency and Spill Plan.\n\nThe established procedures for the delivery and storage of hydrogen at the Nashville Glass Plant outline the methods of transferring hydrogen from the delivery vessel to the storage tank and storing hydrogen that minimize releases.\n\nEmplo"

      "SummaryText": "yees with job responsibilities associated with the storage, handling or use of hydrogen are thoroughly trained or otherwise deemed competent in the hydrogen-related procedures relevant to their responsibilities.\n\nThe inspection and corrective action procedures at the Nashville Glass Plant are utilized to ensure that the structural integrity of the hydrogen system and the adequacy of the security measures associated with the system are properly maintained.\n\nAccess to the storage tank and vaporizer of the hydrogen system is established through limited distribution of keys to the lock securing the fence.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY [40 CFR 68.155(e)]\nNashville Glass Plant has never had a hydrogen-related accident.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM [40 CFR 68.155(f)]\nThe Nashville Glass Plant has personnel trained to respond to the on-site effects of accidental hydrogen releases.  Response to the off-site effects of accidental hydrogen releases at Nashville Glass Plant is coordinated with the fire department and other emergency response agencies in accordance with the Nashville Glass Plant Contingency and Spill Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY [40 CFR 68.155(g)]\nAfter consideration of the identified release scenarios, the accident history, and the process hazard analysis for the hydrogen system at the Nashville Glass Plant, no changes are deemed necessary by the plant."
