In keeping with this policy, our objective is to reduce the generation or release of toxic pollutants, hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. By successfully reducing and/or eliminating pollution at the source, Chemstar can minimize the impact on the air, water and land. Chemstar will also achieve cost savings, improve efficiencies, and maintain a safer workplace for our employees. \r\nIn order to implement Chemstar's environmental policy, the following guidelines will be observed:\r\n1.\tEnvironmental protection is everyone's responsibility. It is valued by the company and by the community at large.\r\n2.\tAll employees are encouraged to actively seek methods to reduce the generation or release of toxic pollutants at its source, and to contain all toxic materials within the process.\r\n3.\tReductions will be made by mechanical methods where possible, and by improved handling methods. \r\n4.\tProcess changes which may substitute hazardous with non-hazardous materials or reduce the usage of hazardous materials will be given high priority.\r\nChemstar Products Company seeks to demonstrate its corporate citizenship by adhering to all environmental regulations. Chemstar promotes cooperation with industry, government, and the public in the shared goal of preventing pollution at the source. \r\nChemstar Products Company manufactures starch derivative products such as adhesives and colloids. Our main raw material is corn starch. The finished product are packaged in paper bags and are not considered to be hazardous or contain hazardous chemicals. \r\nIn the manufacture of certain starch derivatives, Chemstar Products Company uses propylene oxide ad a raw material.

      "SummaryText": "stored under an inert atmosphere and under pressure. Instrumentation continuously monitors the storage tank for level, temperature, and atmosphere around the tank. The instrumentation feeds the information to a computer that checks to make sure that the storage tank and piping systems are within established operating limits. If the operating limits fall outside these parameters, an alarm will sound, and an indicating light will illuminate showing the problem. The computer will take corrective action based on the fault. For example, when filling the tank, the computer will signal an alarm at the high level and will shut down filling operations when the level in the storage tank reaches the maximum safe level. There is a deluge system for the storage tank and the bulk delivery truck if conditions exceed safe limits. This system is automatic and will activate without human input. There are manual deluge activation switches near the storage tank. There is also a plant chemical emergency alarm that the plant personnel can sound. The deluge is designed to cover the entire storage tank and delivery truck with a water spray to cool the tank, sand dilute and capture any released propylene oxide. The water from te deluge system is pumped into two large holding tanks where the water can be treated, if needed, prior to disposal. For critical alarm conditions there is an auto-dialer that will call a set of telephone numbers if the plant alarm is not acknowledged in 6 minutes. The dialer will continue calling until acknowledged. The computer, monitoring devices and the plant telephone systems are on a backup generator. These systems will have power in the event that power is lost to the plant or if the main plant breaker is tripped or shut down. \r\nThere has not been an accident in the last five-years at the Carlton, MN facility involving propylene oxide that resulted in an injury, a fatality, a release/spill, shelter-in-place event, a facility evacuation or community evacuation."
