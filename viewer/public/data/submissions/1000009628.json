(F & A Dairy) prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) for its Newman plant in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2745, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. Finally, both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM standards as defined in CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\nF & A Dairy prepared the RMP/PSM Program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, F & A Dairy has written an Emergency Response Program and personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on emergency services provided by the local fire department and the Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Response team. F & A Dairy will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM Program.\n\nF & A Dairy's Newman plant is located at 691 Inyo Avenue, Newman, California. The area is zoned for industrial use. This facility processes milk into cheeses "

The refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 9,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides cooling to the cold storage rooms, and liquid product storage tanks. The cold rooms are used to store finished products ready for shipping. The liquid product storage tanks hold the raw milk before processing.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP. Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the F & A Dairy Newman facility due to the quantity of ammonia used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"the greatest amount held in a single vessel?released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. F & A Dairy has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The F & A Dairy ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down pump components if deviations from normal operating condition"

Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n* Ammonia leak detection in processing areas - Installation in progress\n* Remote emergency shutdown switch\n* Fire sprinklers in both cold boxes and dry storage areas\n* component specific safety shutdowns\n\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility, F & A Dairy has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system. Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program and an RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) are prepared for the ammonia system at the facility. The SOPs will provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nF & A Dairy is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system. A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment. The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility. F & A Dairy has had no reportable releases of ammonia during the pas"

F & A Dairy will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly and has established completion schedules for proposed actions. Management responses and support will be consistent with F & A Dairy's commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\n\nF & A Dairy recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as F & A Dairy Newman continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. F & A Dairy Newman will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with F & A Dairy's internal review practices, and F & A Dairy will maintain the most current versions on site. Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM and related documents and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\n"
