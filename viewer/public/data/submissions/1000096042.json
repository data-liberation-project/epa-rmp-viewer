The design of the facility incorporates multiple safety devices, such as refrigeration controls, interlocks, alarms and ammonia detection systems. Safe handling procedures, maintaining mechanical integrity, and appropriate training of our personnel are key elements of the Penske safety program.\n\n\n\nPenske has implemented a process safety management (PSM) program that complies with 29 CFR 1910.119, which requires Penske to develop safeguards to prevent an ammonia release. A component of the PSM plan is the emergency action plan, developed consistent with 29 CFR 1910.38. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with external responders.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPenske is a cold storage facility that stores and distributes produce. Cold storage requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of foods, and Penske uses ammonia as the refrigerant. Access to the facility is limited to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nPenske's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment. Plan elements include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually, audited every three years, and updated as necessary by Penske.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating the refrigeration system understands the refrigeration process, the operating procedures, "

Only qualified maintenance personnel operate the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the Penske facility in the past five years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\n\n\nPenske has a written emergency action plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It complies with the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.38. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with external responders. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been provided to and reviewed with the local fire department.\n\n\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Penske and to establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, Penske has trained personnel to immediately notify the local fire department and take defensive actions to mitigate the release. Automatic alarms, shutdown systems, and controls have been designed to minimize the potential for an uncontrolled release.\n\n\n\nAll Penske personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock emergency drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\n\n\n\nThis plan shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nUpgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with codes and standards applicable at that time.\n\n\n\nPenske completed a process hazard analysis in October, 2017. Higher priority items were completed soon after the anal"
