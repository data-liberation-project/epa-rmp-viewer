The 50/50 joint venture was formed on April 1, 1996 to consolidate the elastomer resources, production facilities, technical expertise, and business skills from both companies.  Globally, DuPont Dow Elastomers offers a wide variety of products ranging from thermoset rubber polymers used in the general rubber industry to high-performance fluoroelastomers used by the chemical processing and automotive industries. \n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires certain companies, like ours, to share information about the chemicals we use, the potential risks those chemicals pose to the community, the ways that we manage these risks, and the plans we have made to respond to a possible release of these chemicals.  This requirement is part of the Congress's Clean Air Act known as the Risk Management Planning (RMP) rule.  This executive summary is provided in compliance with 40 CFR \u00a7 68.155 of the RMP rule.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDupont Dow Elastomers Hypalon\u00ae Unit is committed to operating and maintaining our process in a safe and responsible manner.  We follow a corporate philosophy that the goal is zero.  This means we constantly strive for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  We have programs, procedures and management practices in place to support this goal of zero.  We constantly assess our progress against this goal of zero and take corrective actions to get back on track whenever necessary.\n\nOur primary focus is on prevention of any accidental releases.  However, we have strong emergency response capabilities to back-up our prevention activities.  We use this combination of prevention programs and emergency response capability"

These chemicals include: carbon tetrachloride and sulfuryl chloride.\n\nKey Off-Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nTo help with understanding the potential impact on the community due to a release of chemicals from DuPont Dow Elastomers Hypalon\u00ae Unit, we have provided information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios for our facility.   \n\nThese scenarios were developed using the guidance and technical data supplied by the EPA.  Scenario information similar to that described below has been used for many years as part of our process safety management program.  In the past we have modeled potential releases and analyzed the results to help us continuously improve our processes and reduce risk.  We continue to do these assessments as part of our internal process safety management systems.\n\nThe EPA defines the worst case scenario as a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated chemical.  The scenario assumes the entire quantity is released in ten minutes, even if it is impossible to do so.\n\nUsing the methods described by the EPA, the worst case release of a toxic chemical from the DuPont Dow Elastomers Hypalon\u00ae Unit would be the release of the entire contents of a sulfur dioxide railcar (180,000 pounds) in a 10-minute period.  Using EPA guidelines, a release like this could impact the public 16 miles from the point of the release.  Depending on the wind direction at the time of the release, most of Jefferson County and parts of Orange County would be affected.  \n\nThe worst case scenario described above underscores the need for very rigorous process safety management systems.  It is important to note however, that none of the prevention and"

      "SummaryText": "mitigation equipment, practices, and procedures that have been put in place by DuPont Dow Elastomers to prevent or respond to releases such as these are taken into account for these worst case scenarios.  \n\nSince the worst case scenarios are so very improbable, they are not good cases to focus on for emergency response planning with the local community.   In order to facilitate emergency response planning with the community, the EPA has included the requirement for companies to report alternate case scenarios.  These alternate case scenarios provide a more realistic picture of what could actually happen if the safety systems used by a facility were to fail.\n\nThe EPA requires that companies include one alternate release scenario for regulated flammables as a group and one for each regulated toxic chemical.  This is because the impact of a flammable scenario on the public is expected to be similar for all the different types of flammables.   The toxic chemicals can vary in their effects and so must be reviewed individually.  In the data elements section of this report you will find a detailed description of all these alternate release scenarios.\n\nThe largest and most significant toxic alternate case scenario for DuPont Dow Elastomers Hypalon\u00ae Unit is a large leak of chlorine from instrument tubing, a flange gasket, or a leaking valve.  This could result in over 1,000 pounds of chlorine released into the atmosphere.  Under normal weather conditions, this release could go 1056 feet before the toxic concentration falls below the level of concern.  Because of the process location, this release would not leave the Beaumont Industrial Park site.   Although it would impact our employees or others inside the Industrial Park boundaries, it would not impact areas where the public has access.  Of course, we have accident prevention activities in place to protect our employees and Industrial Park personnel from injury.\n\nKnowing the impact of a release like this, DuPont Dow Elast"

Site practices that incorporate these concepts include the following:\n \no    A thorough understanding of our process technology including the safe limits of the processes and the  \n      proper materials of construction for equipment;\no    Proper design and installation of equipment;\no    Systematic process hazard review studies to identify and manage process hazards;\no    Written operating and maintenance procedures;\no    Extensive training for all individuals involved in operating or maintaining a chemical process;\no    Mechanical integrity testing and preventive maintenance to detect potential equipment problems early;\no    Mechanical quality assurance programs to ensure the correct spare parts are installed every time \n      maintenance work is done;\no    Procedures to assess and manage the safety and environmental impact of changes to the process \n      technology or equipment;\no    Pre-startup safety reviews for equipment that is newly installed or modified;\no    Compliance audits to ensure process safety management procedures are effective and implemented \n      properly;\no    Investigation of actual and potential incidents to identify and implement corrective actions;\no    Participation of all employees in the process safety management system;\no    Documented safe work practices, and\no    A contractor management system to ensure work done by contractors is done safely and meets \n      DuPont Dow Elastomers quality standards.\n\nIn addition to the practices described above, we have designed our processes to include multiple layers of safeguards.  Examples of these include:\n\n\u00b7 Automatic valves for rail cars, which isolate the supply of materials fr"

DuPont Dow Elastomers began operation of the Hypalon\u00ae Unit on April 1, 1996.  Prior to that time, the facilities were operated by DuPont.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn addition to all we do to prevent accidental releases, DuPont Dow Elastomers is committed to maintaining a strong emergency response capability to back-up our prevention activities.   The Beaumont Industrial Park has an on-site emergency response team, staffed 24 hours a day.   The emergency responders are thoroughly trained and properly equipped to respond to releases of any chemicals used on the site.  \nEach operating area in the Beaumont Industrial Park has developed an Emergency Response Plan.  These plans include steps to contain, control, and terminate any release of hazardous materials and bring under control any resulting fires or explosions.   \nSome of the elements of the plan include:\n\n\u00b7 Emergency shutdown procedures;\n\u00b7 Activation of the Emergen"
