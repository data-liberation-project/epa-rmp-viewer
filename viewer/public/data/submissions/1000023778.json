Its Process Safety/Risk Management program described here\r\naddresses how Intel manages the risks associated with high hazard chemical processes to prevent accidental\r\nreleases, fires, or injuries related to process upsets with high or catastrophic potential. Intel's advanced\r\nprocesses are consuming higher volumes of some hazardous gases than previous process technologies. To\r\naccommodate this increased demand, without increasing exposure risk, Intel has implemented an industry\r\nstandard offering of DOT ISO module/trailer and ISOtainer/trailers to provide the process gas delivery and\r\nreplace smaller industry standard cylinders. Doing this will increase the of the gas delivery package, but it\r\nwill also reduce projected package change frequency at advanced process factories in some cases by 25X. It\r\nis well known in the gas industry that it is the package change which represents the highest risk for a release\r\npotential. Intel has conducted numerous hazard assessments in conjunction with the ISO module and\r\nISOtainer supplier's and our Architectural and Engineering (A&E) consultant. This included conducting\r\nnumerous HazOp studies, consequence analysis on numerous scenarios, and a Layers of Protection Analysis\r\n(LOPA) in order to determine the risk management and control strategies. The following describes the\r\ncomprehensive Process Safety and Risk Management Program elements for all of these high hazard chemical\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nSAFETY IN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN\r\nToday's semiconductor facilities utilize toxic, corrosive, pyrophoric, and flammable materials. These materials\r\nare inherently hazardous, sometimes in small quantities, and therefore safety engineering is required to\r\ncontain the hazard, reducing the risk to meet acceptable risk levels. The risk management"

EHS requirements such as SEMI S2 (safety), SEMI S8\r\n(ergonomics), and S10 (hazard classification) are just part of the S series of SEMI guidelines intended to\r\ndefine these industry safety standards for process equipment. In addition, Intel-specific requirements are\r\nincluded to address other risks. These include combustible material restrictions to reduce fire risk and\r\nenvironmental characterization and emissions requirements to control and manage our site environmental\r\npermitting requirements for air, waste, and water emissions.\r\nAfter the procurement of process equipment, it must be installed and integrated into facility systems. To\r\naccomplish this, EHS has integrated its requirements into the process equipment installation standards. This\r\nincludes ergonomic clearances for safe maintenance and operation, ventilation, spill control, gas detection,\r\nand all EHS aspects related to how the process equipment is installed. After these requirements have been\r\nestablished for equipment installations at the Technology Development site, they are transferred via the\r\nMaster Design Package, which documents how all process equipment is installed at high volume\r\nmanufacturing sites.\r\nSemiconductor process equipment is supported by larger facilities systems that perform gas distribution, bulk\r\nchemical delivery, and waste treatment. EHS requirements are integrated into the design of this equipment\r\nthrough the Intel EHS Facilities Equipment Procurement Process, which is an Intel master specif"

This starts with outlining process safety expectations early in\r\nthe Request for Proposal (RFP) and Request For Quote (RFQ) from each supplier, and ends in the final design\r\nof the equipment.\r\nProcess equipment and facilities equipment must all reside within the walls of the actual fabrication facilities.\r\nEHS has integrated its requirements through the EHS Master Design Standard (MDS). The EHS MDS defines\r\nthe requirements and expectations for the fabrication facilities. This standard is used to support the many\r\ncodes, standards, and regulations that drive the design of our facilities.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\nAll new facilities systems utilizing high hazard chemicals have a formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nconducted to assess the upset conditions the equipment may present, the controls in place, and the\r\nadequacies of these controls to prevent events with high or catastrophic potential. This process is a 3 step\r\napproach:\r\n1. An initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) is required on all new chemical facilities systems\r\nregardless of the and applicability to OSHA PSM or EPA RMP. One the following methodologies are utilized\r\nto determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\r\nWhat-If Checklist;\r\nHazard Mode Effects Analysis\r\nHazard and Operability Study (HAZOP);\r\n2.
