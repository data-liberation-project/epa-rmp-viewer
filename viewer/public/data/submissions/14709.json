      "SummaryText": "A.   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSeaboard Farms recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the Guymon facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has a Plant Safety Program in place.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated with damage of property, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Dennis Estenson, Refrigeration General, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and a"

      "SummaryText": "ccepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSeaboard Farms Inc. operates a pork facility in Guymon, OK.  The facility operates two  ammonia refrigeration systems (i.e the main refrigeration system and the auxiliary freezer system) to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in these systems is above the EPA  threshold of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of ammonia in the main refrigeration system and the auxiliary freezer system is 167,000 and 35,000 pounds, respectively.  Since ammonia releases from these systems could pose a risk of offsite public impact and they are regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nMain Refrigeration System\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the main refrigeration system at the Guymon facility involves the release of 84,627 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the Low Pressure Accumulator.  This quantity represents the full capacity of the vessel, which is a conservative assumption as the liquid level within the accumulator is normally within the 20-30% range.   Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 5.23 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance is calculated based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario related to the main refrigeration system is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\t \tThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n\t \tThe Low Pressure Accumulator is located on a pad in an area with minimal traffic (e.g., forklifts);\n\t \tIndustry standards have been followed for the manufacture and quality control of the accumulator;\n\t \tAmmo"
