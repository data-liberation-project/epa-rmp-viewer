Billings Public Works Department (PWD) maintains quantities of chlorine above the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds and as such is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  A hazard review was completed to determine the RMP program level applicable to PWD's chlorine system. \n\nThe information presented in this section is intended to describe the elements of PWD's Risk Management Program.  The format of the section corresponds to the executive summary data elements as dictated in 40 CFR Part 68 Executive Summary Section.  \n\nExecutive Summary Data Elements\n\nAccording to EPA guidance the executive summary must include a brief description of the facility\u00bfs Risk Management Program.  The following sections list each of the required executive summary data elements by rule citation. \n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\nBillings Public Works Department Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has operated their chlorination system without incident since 1948. This successful operating record is due to the WWTP's commitment to training programs, operating procedures, and maintenance activities.  \n\n68.155(b) Stationary Source and the Substance Handled\nBillings Public Works Department operates a 40-MGD municipal wastewater treatment plant near the Yellowstone River.  Chlorine is used at the treatment facility as the disinfectant for the discharge water.\n\nChlorine for the chlorination process is stored in ton cylinders.  Normally four ton cylinders are stored with two cylinders attached to the process at one time.  Our present chlorine supplier is local.  The chlorination process is contained within the confines of the secure waste"

The WWTP maintains chlorine leak detection devices within the chlorine process and in other areas where chlorine may be released.  There are audible and visual alarms in the facility and plans are being finalized to connect chlorine alarms to the facility\u00bfs process control system.\n\n68.155(c) Offsite Consequence Analysis\nOne worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario was assessed for the chlorine process.  To ensure a common basis for comparisons EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or more likely.  \n \nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine has been defined by EPA to be 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).  This airborne concentration that is used as the toxic endpoint is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects. \n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process.  Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information.  The population number is reported as part of the EPA submittal.  This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a single chlorine release, because the chlorine plume would seek lowest elevations in the direction of the prominent winds.  Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method.\n\nRelease scenarios and distances to toxic endpoints are discussed in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nWorst-Case Release Scenario is determined in accordance with the requi"

The greatest amount held in a single vessel or\n2. The greatest amount in a pipe.  \n\nFor the chlorine process at the WWTP the worst-case release is that a 1-ton cylinder (maximum amount held in a single vessel) of chlorine ruptures and its contents escape to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  In the event the 1-ton cylinder would release its entire contents to the atmosphere in 10 minutes the release rate would be 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the toxic end point worst-case release distance was taken from the EPA\u00bfs dispersion modeling program RMPComp.  \n\nThe residential population within the 0.9-mile radius of influence was determined to be approximately 3242.  The Yellowstone County G.I.S. provided the population within the radius of influence.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nOne alternative release scenario was evaluated for the chlorine process per USEPA 40 CFR 68.165(a)(2).  The alternative release scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\n\nThe scenario for the alternative release follows:\n\nConsideration was given to alternative release scenarios that were considered more likely however, due to the safety systems in place, none of the alternatives considered resulted in an offsite impact.  Even though the WWTP has never experienced a shipping container incident, we felt that this failure represented the most reasonable scenario for an alternative release to reach offsite.  The worst alternate release scenario was determined to be a \u00bd inch hole in the bottom of the container.\n\nThe alternative release scenario release rate and distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated using the Aloha program, which  is the air model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).    The information is presented below.\n\nHole Diameter"

The WWTP aligned its prevention program with OSHA in 1999.  The WWTP continuously evaluates and updates their safety and prevention procedures as needed.  The WWTP prepared our process hazard analysis for the chlorine system as part the development of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n68.155(e) Five-year Accident History\nThe chlorination facility has been in place since 1950.  No accidents, as described under 40 CFR 68.42(a), have occurred at this facility since it began operation.\n\n68.155(f) Emergency Response Program\nThe emergency response program established by the WWTP does not require personnel to act as the site incident commander.  In the case of an incident the City of Billings Fire Department becomes the incident commander and assumes the role of directing response activities including any community emergency evacuation measures.  Fire department staff train at the WWTP facility on a frequent basis.  The facility's Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the Yellowstone County LEPC.\n \n68.155(g) Safety Improvements\nThe facility is currently in the process of evaluating the recommendations from the PHA revalidation completed in 2001 and the audit completed in 2004.  Any improvements made in response to the recommendations will be documented and added to the PSM/RMP documentation.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs part of the WWTP's commitment to safety and respect for the hazards associated with handling and storing chlorine, the WWTP had an existing chlorine management system in place prior to the EPA RMP mandate.  To comply with RMP, the WWTP re-evaluated their current system for handling chlorine and"
