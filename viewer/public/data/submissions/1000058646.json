Newell's (SuperValu) implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance  program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both Pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC)to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requiremenst for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. W. newell has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions taken to minimize potenntial for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented. Lastly the PSM program incorporates the facility's emergency response  plan and places special emphasis on the handling of accidental releases of ammonia and the coordination of emergency response activities with the local fire authority and other response agencies.",
