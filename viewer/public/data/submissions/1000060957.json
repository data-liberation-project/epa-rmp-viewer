ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nMarysville Ethanol, LLC recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional release of ammonia. The safety and health of all employees and the public is very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n\n\nMarysville Ethanol, LLC believes that employee participation is the key to a successful program. Operating level employees have been involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they assume the major responsibility for operating facility safely. The Marysville Ethanol, LLC Emergency Response Program has been developed with the cooperation and support of the Marysville Fire Department. All Marysville Ethanol, LLC employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nMarysville Ethanol, LLC is an ethanol fuel production facility that is permitted to produce 65 million gallons per year. The facility is located just south of Marysville, Michigan, and just east of Interstate 94. The site encompasses 42 acres, and is located adjacent to and on lands occupied by Marysville Hydrocarbons, LLC, who is leasing the property to Marysville Ethanol, LLC. Although these are separate entities, they share a common plant fence line.\n\n\n\nThe feedstock for the fuel ethanol facility is corn, which will be delivered by truck and rail. The corn is milled to a coarse powder, and fed to the cook section where enzymes are added to break the starch down into sugars. The sugars are broken down further in the slurry tank with the addition of steam. From the slurry tank the solution goes to the fermentation tanks where it is mixed with yeast. The fermentation process takes approximately 50 hours to complete. The fermented solution, which is "

      "SummaryText": "approximately 18% ethanol, is then distilled to 190 proof. This intermediate product is further refined to pure (i.e., 200 proof) ethanol. At this stage, the ethanol is denatured and stored in one of two 750,000 gallon above ground tanks before the product is loaded onto railcars or trucks for shipment. The final product is approximately 98% ethanol. \n\nMarysville Ethanol, LLC uses natural gasoline, which is a regulated flammable material under the RMP regulations, in the process to denature the ethanol and make it unsuitable for human consumption. The natural gasoline will be delivered to the site by truck, and pumped into a 165,000-gallon bulk storage tank with a floating roof.\n\n\n\nSeveral safety features are designed into the natural gasoline system:\n\n?    Standard operating procedure is for the tank to not be filled more than 90% of capacity. This will help ensure that spills do not occur from overfilling.\n\n?    Fusible links that will stop flow in the event of a fire near the storage tank or pumps.\n\n\n\nEthanol itself is a regulated substance under 29 CFR 1910.119 (PSM) and is covered under the facility's PSM program, but is not regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP) and is not addressed in this document.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst case and alternate scenarios have been defined for a release of natural gasoline.\n\n\n\nFor natural gasoline, a flammable mixture, EPA requires that the worst-case scenario consider the release of the entire contents of the natural gasoline storage tank (which is the vessel containing the largest inventory of flammable covered chemical) and subsequent formation of a vapor cloud.  The entire contents of the vapor cloud are assumed to be within the flammable limits, and the cloud is assumed to explode. Per the EPA requirements, 10 percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion, and the consequence distance is taken as the distance to an overpressure level of 1 pound "

      "SummaryText": "per square inch (psi). This release has a distance to the 1 psi overpressure level of 0.81 miles. The potential impacted population is estimated to be 132 people.\n\nThe alternate scenario involves a rupture of the 3-inch pipe/valve at the base of the tank and subsequent draining of the entire contents of the tank followed by the formation of a vapor cloud with a concentration at the lower flammable limit; the distance to the lower flammable limit in the alternate scenario is 0.041 miles. No residential receptors were identified in this area. The impacted population would consist entirely of the workforce at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMarysville Ethanol, LLC complies with the OSHA PSM for Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard relative to natural gasoline, and ethanol. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the natural gasoline storage and supply systems. Further, operations personnel have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of these systems.\n\n\n\nThe natural gasoline system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and to conform to industry standards. The system includes emergency shutdown systems to avert serious system conditions. Periodic maintenance on the natural gasoline system is ensured via the use of a computerized maintenance management system.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.  5 -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past five years, this facility has had no significant accidental releases of natural gasoline. Operation of the facility began in October 2007.\n\n\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThis ethanol production facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance. Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation. The St. Clair County LEPC has been notified regarding the Marysvill"

Marysville Ethanol, LLC will evaluate the safety programs, including the passive and active mitigation systems associated with the covered storage and use systems in the light of any release or potential incidents, protection systems in place at other facilities, and industry practices on a regular basis."
