This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur at Lonestar NGL Mont Belvieu Fractionators (FRAC) our response activities are coordinated with the Mont Belvieu Police Department and the local mutual aid organization - Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu (MAMB).\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Lonestar NGL Mont Belvieu Fractionators (FRAC) RMP-regulated activities involves the extraction and fractionation of Y Grade Feed.  The Plant consists of 4 units capable of processing approximately 100,000 BPD each of Y-Grade feed that is delivered by pipeline to Mont Belvieu.  The Export Frac Unit is unique and different in that it only produces Ethane and Propane product streams.  The other three units, Frac Units I, II, and III are essentially identical in size and design and they are designed to produce purity Ethane, Propane, N-Butane, Isobutane, and Natural Gasoline Products.  \n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps the facility has taken represents all the necessary steps to comply with the accident release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLonestar maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conduct"

Lonestar NGL Mont Belvieu Fractionators uses a variety of widely recognized quantitative and qualitative process hazard and risk analysis methodologies such as \"Hazop\", \"What-if\", and \"LOPA\" to recognize and manage our facility hazard and risk reduction processes.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval not to exceed 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lonestar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nLonestar has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating process are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nLonestar carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, valves, gas detectors, flame detector, and temperature and pressure switches,  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies iden"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment in operation.  \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nLonestar will conduct audits on a regular basis to confirm that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being properly and adequately implemented.  These audits will be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nLonestar promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nLonestar truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.   Company employees are strongly encourage to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History\n\nLonestar as a whole company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention polices, there have been no accidental release of substances regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 at the Lonestar Mont Belvieu NGL Fractionators during this period which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage..  \n\n5.    Emergency Response Plan\n\nLonestar maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.   The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post incident decontamination of affected areas. \n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the emergency response plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n6.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt the present time, there are no plans for significant changes to the facility for the purpose of improving safety. \n\n"
