As such, all Union Carbide facilities now operate under and adhere to policies and standards of The Dow Chemical Company.  The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Technology Park, North Charleston Distribution Terminal, Massey Yard, and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWest Virginia Operations is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Massey Rail Yard is used to temporarily store rail cars for eventual processing at the South Charleston Plant or for eventual transport to other locations.  The rail yard is managed by the South Charleston Plant, but is not considered contiguous with the South Charleston Plant.  No chemical loading or unloading takes place at the Massey Rail Yard.  \n\nThere are 4 RMP regulated substances present in rail cars at the yard. There are no Union Carbide-owned EPA RMP regulated toxic chemicals stored in the Massey Rail Yard.\nUnion Carbide owns and stores thresh"

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nUnion Carbide?s general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA?s PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System.  Key elements include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined), HAZOP?s, Audits, Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Union Carbide Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address var"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nWe carry out a highly documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nUnion Carbide facilities require management of all modifications to process equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions other than \"like for like\", by identifying and reviewing them prior to implementation of changes.   Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Union Carbide. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placi"

Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nUnion Carbide promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nUnion Carbide Corporation believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOur company hires contractors to perform specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.  West Virginia Operations has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor?s work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.

The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition to the on-site emergency squad, Union Carbide staffs a Distribution Emergency Response Team (DERT) in the Kanawha Valley that responds to accidental releases from transportation equipment throughout the continental United States\n\nKanawha/Putnam EPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to improve safety, help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n"
