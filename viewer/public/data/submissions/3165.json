To that end, we have developed an extensive program to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community. We operate under Process Safety Management guidelines, a rigorous set of standards that govern our daily control methods and behaviors.\nThese guidelines have been adopted to satisfy the stated policy of GE Plastics to safely manage our site operations. But more than just policy drives us to put safety ahead of all other factors, including financial issues. We pledge to take care of the people who work here and the community around us because they include our family, friends and neighbors.  In short, this region is our home. \nWe recognize that to do otherwise would weaken the economic foundation on which our community is built. The Mt. Vernon site has been the backbone of the global GE Plastics business for nearly 40 years and the people working on the site are committed to building upon that positive legacy for decades to come.\nThe Risk Management Plan contained in this report is a continuation of that effort, ensuring that there is a solid integration of our site emergency response resources with those available in the community, and that effective communication channels are in place.\nOur intensive series of internal reviews and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) external audit process have validated the strengths of the programs we have in place. We have been recognized by OSHA, under the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), as being among the best in the nation for worker safety.  We have been designated a STAR site, the highest recognition OSHA gives.\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.

Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority everywhere we do business.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  \nTo provide top quality products for our customers, the manufacturing process at the GE Plastics-Mt. Vernon facility uses some raw materials that are classified as toxic or flammable. While we are committed to 100 percent compliance with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards, as well as systematic assessments used to manage and maintain safe operations with these materials, we routinely go far beyond the regulatory requirements.  Our operating practices and procedures, along with our automated control systems, ensure all steps are taken to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.\nIn the unlikely event of a major release, our trained on-site emergency response organization would be activated. This organization includes a fire brigade, medical and chemical emergency response teams staffed with GE personnel who have collectively committed thousands of hours to training. Many of these individuals are so committed to emergency response, they serve on their community fire and emergency response departments as well. As a result, they devote much of their personal time to additional drills, training and community response.\nEffective maintenance and implementation of such a contingency plan relies on strong cooperation with the community's emergency response teams. We consistently network with other emergency response providers in our county, as well as those in neighboring counties. We ar"

Vernon site would involve the catastrophic failure of a storage tank containing liquid phosgene and the simultaneous failure of the safety ventilation and control system that prevents phosgene emissions reaching the atmosphere from the building enclosure. The quantity of material released is assumed to be 21,000 pounds of phosgene. Under this scenario, the phosgene liquid is assumed to completely evaporate and the vapors disperse in the direction of the prevailing wind.  According to EPA guidelines, exposure to phosgene can occur without serious health effects at levels up to 0.2 parts per million  (0.00081 mg per liter) for approximately one hour. \nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) involving RMP-regulated flammable materials at the facility assumes the unlikely failure of a mono-methylamine (MMA) storage tank, which could result in the immediate release of up to 59,000 pounds of gas.  The assumption is that the gas would ignite and result in a vapor cloud explosion. \nA scenario using more realistic assumptions involves a rupture of a pipe containing up to 3 percent phosgene gas.   EPA defines this as the Alternative Release Scenario (ARS), typically used for emergency planning purposes.  This assumes as much as 16 pounds phosgene would be released within a 10-minute period. We already have in place perimeter gas analyzers that would detect such a line rupture and allow operators to shut down and isolate the pipe within 10 minutes, enabling us to mitigate the impact of this scenario.\nThe ARS for chlorine involves an upset in our chlorine manufacturing process releasing 17 pounds of chlorine gas. \nThe ARS for nitric acid involves a leak in a pipe connection to the nitric acid storage tank releasing 198 pounds of nitric acid. \nThe ARS for ammonia involves a leak in a pipe connection to the ammonia storage tank releasing 785 pounds of ammonia during a 10-minute duration. \nThe ARS for mono-methylamine (MMA) involves failure"

Close and routine monitoring by trained and certified operators and the existence of remote shutoff valves and on-site fire brigade and chemical response teams would mitigate the impact of this scenario.\n0.5 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION / CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nGE Plastics complies with a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (or PSM). The programs ensure that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained. The programs satisfy the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP.\nSome of the many, specific safety features in place to prevent a chemical accident include:\nREGULATORY COMPLIANCE\n7 Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error, which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n7 Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks to contain a spill;\n7 Routine pipe and vessel inspection and testing;\n7 Written operating procedures that include emergency response actions;\n7 Comprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistent safe work-practices;\n7 Maintenance programs to ensure ongoing equipment reliability - including equipment testing and inspection;\n7 A safety procedure to review proposed plant modifications before they are implemented for possible hazards - this is called Management of Change; \n7 Safety pre-qualification for all contractors;\n7 Safety reviews prior to startup of our processes; and,\n7 Safety permitting procedures that control hazards during special operations such as welding and other maintenance activities.\n VOLUNTARY RISK REDUCTION\n7 Computer-controlled safety systems on the"

Vernon plant is the largest fully integrated polycarbonate facility in the world, sitting on a 1000+ -acre tract along the Ohio River, about two miles south of the city of Mt. Vernon, Indiana.  It was built in 1960 and currently employs about 1,650 people in the Southern Indiana area.  GE Plastics manufactures engineered plastics, marketed under trade names such as LEXANR, ULTEMR, VALOXR, and others.  Our products are used in a vast array of applications, including the automotive, medical, electronic, construction, computer, and appliance industries. \nUnlike most plastics manufacturing locations, the Mt. Vernon site houses four separate businesses, plus support services and research. It's headquarters to three of the GE Plastics-Americas businesses, as well as the Structured Products manufacturing plant and the Mt. Vernon Technology Department, where more than 80 top scientists and engineers work on the cutting edge of plastics innovation, developing materials and applications for new products and plastics manufacturing processes. \nBoth work-place safety and environmental protection are part of the culture at the GE Plastics facility, with more than $500 million being invested in the site since 1991 for expansion, capital improvement, safety and environmental protection.

Most recently, in 1998 the Chlorine Institute recognized the Brine Recovery Unit for having the largest continuous reduction in OSHA recordable injuries over the previous three-year period. \nThe Mt. Vernon plant uses five chemicals that are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  These are: Mono-methylamine (MMA), a regulated flammable substance; Phosgene, a regulated toxic substance; Chlorine, a regulated toxic substance; Nitric acid, a regulated toxic substance; and Ammonia, a regulated toxic substance.\nPhosgene, chlorine, mono-methylamine, and nitric acid are raw materials used to manufacture our products.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in our manufacturing process.   \n0.4 HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nAs part of our risk management planning, we specifically have identified the type of event that, should it ever occur, would have the most negative impacts on our workers and our neighbors.  The RMP regulation refers to this as the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS).  As defined by EPA, we are required to assume that the numerous engineering and administrative safety controls we have in place to prevent or mitigate such accidents have all failed at once. EPA defines a worst-case scenario as a catastrophic failure, which is an event that essentially results in the 10-minute release of the contents in the largest single vessel on-site that results in the greatest distance to the EPA-defined level-of-concern.  Two types of consequences must be evaluated: a release of an EPA-listed toxic chemical and a release of an EPA-listed flammable chemical.\nIn reality, even EPA admits that the likelihood of this occurring is indeed rare.  Actually, EPA advises that discussing non-worst-case scenarios, such as the Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) described below, with the community is more useful and more appropriate for the purposes of developing community emergency response plans. \nNonetheless, as outlined in th"

Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.  \n In keeping with the requirement to report all incidents in the past five years that involved regulated chemicals and resulted in an off-site impact or had a significant on-site impact in this document, only one incident applies.  On Oct. 13, 1994, a release of chlorine vapor totaling 34 pounds occurred due to a rupture of a demister tank (17 pounds) and separate back pressure of the chlorine cells (17 pounds) during start-up of our chlorine manufacturing process. There was no off-site impact and no one was injured. There was on-site property damage, but all safety systems functioned as designed to prevent further release of materials. Following this incident, GE increased the level of safety control automation and implemented revised start-up procedures to prevent future occurrences.  \n 0.7 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n The Mt. Vernon site maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, the public, and the environment from all levels of accidental release. Our trained fire brigade, medical and chemical response teams participate in a mutual aid agreement with emergency response providers within our own and surrounding counties and are active members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Disaster Recovery Business Alliance. These affiliations enable us to maintain close working relationships with area hospitals, industries, and other response organizations in the Southern Indiana area.  We've also invested in the equipment needed to respond to emergencies, both on-site and off-site, and staff a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week command center program.

Vernon and the surrounding area. The five-siren system can be heard within 4+ miles from the center of town.  Though we have never had to activate the sirens on an emergency basis because of an event at GE Plastics, the siren system is available to warn the public in the unlikely event of a major incident. The system has been designed to enhance the area's emergency response services and has been used multiple times for severe weather emergencies.\n Information on how residents can shelter and properly respond in the event of a chemical emergency is available from the city of Mt.
