If an accidental release should occur, the facility id prepared to work with the local fire department or authorities to mitigate and release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  The General Manager of this company is a member of the local volunteer fire department, which helps insure a clear line of communication.\n\nThe primary activity at the storage of anhydrous ammonia is for the sale to farmers.  Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 96,118 pounds in two 11,000 gallon tanks.  This facility also has 18 -1,000 gallon nurse tanks that hold a total of 78,642#.  The overall total is 174,760#.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi trailer holding 41,000 pounds.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario and the alternative case scenario have been removed from the summary at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns.  The figures for distance to endpoint and population have been given to the first responders as part of th RMP.  Population data was achieved by counting houses within the endpoint and assuming 4 people per house.  \n\nThe facility is included in the company training plan, with a goal of annual training for all employees.  This training includes safety information, hazards, operating procedures and the maintenance of an NH3 plant.  Goggles and gloves are stressed for all employees who are involved in loading nurse tanks.\n\nThe Anthony Farmers Coop can report that there have been no injury accidents or reportable releases at this facility within the last 5 years.\n\nThis company has a written emergency action plan that is shared with the Anthony Fire Department.  The plan contains maps and emergency procedures in the event of a release or an emergency.  Our emplo"
