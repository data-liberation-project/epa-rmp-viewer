Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis and the facility has a plan in place for evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies. Cargill also has personnel who are trained to respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. They receive training regularly, or more frequently at needed. The facility also utilizes the Washington County LEPC to respond to chemical releases when necessary. Cargill has coordinated response needs with local emergency planning and response organizations on a regular basis.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nCargill is committed to improving our PSM and RMP programs. In an effort to continually improve our systems, Cargill has an internal process for reviewing all of our open recommendations from audits and PHAs. Additionally, all process changes regarding ammonia refrigeration are reviewed by the site management team prior to making any change. This provides expert review from each critical discipline, i.e. personnel safety, environmental, process safety, etc.\n\nCargill has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility. We believe that the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation, and our commitment to continuous improvement that an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."
