We have sought the aid of our \nlocal community fire department and emergency responders, as well as our \nlocal emergency planning committee, to help devise plans to ensure that the \npeople of our community are protected in the event that the unlikely does \noccur.\n\nOne step that we have taken to ensure adequate response is to predict (using \nmodels provided by the EPA) what the worst possible event might be, so that \nwe can make sure that we, as a community, can respond effectively.   The \nplanning model that we used says that we should be prepared for an event \nthat could spread up to one mile from our plant.   Although this major event \nisn't likely according to the EPA, we still want to error on the side of \nsafety in our planning process.\n\nAnother step that we have taken is to engineer a holding area for chlorine \nin an unused underground storage vessel where the gas may be held without \ndanger to our employees or the community.  If an unexpected leak occurs our \nventilation system will route the gas from our storage room to this area \nwhere it can safely be controlled.\n\nWe have cooperated fully with our local fire department and other responders \nto ensure that they are aware of this possible event and we have \nco-developed, and will continue to cooperatively refine, a plan for making \nsure that people and the environment in our community are protected.\n\nIn the future we may consider other ways to ensure the safety of the \ndrinking water of our community.
