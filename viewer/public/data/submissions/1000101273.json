This commitment demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of ammonia from our close loop refrigeration system. If such a release does occur, our team is fully trained to mitigate the effects of the release if possible. We are also coordinated with the Boardman Fire Department who would provide emergency response expertise for our facility as well as the local HAZMAT team. \n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled: \nWe have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility, which is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 21,940 lbs.\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. \nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we used the EPA\u2019s RMP Comp program.
