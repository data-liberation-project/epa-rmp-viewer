Box 486\nBeloit, KS  67420\n\n\nFor further information contact: Dan Simoneau, Boettcher Enterprises, Plant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Boettcher Enterprises, Inc.,  are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information - the anhydrous ammonia storage tank is located on the East side of Beloit on the South side of Cottonwood Road, just East of the Farmway Coop fertilizer plant.  The plan telephone number is (785) 738-8089, or (785) 738-4181.   \n\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n The maximum quantity stored would be 517,000 pounds, composed of 133,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank, plus a total  potential of 385,000 pounds in up to 24, 1000 gallon nurse trailers and up to 42, 1500 gallon nurse trailers.\n  \nOperating procedures for an emergency situation, unloading at a storage facility, and loading of ammonia nurse trailers have been updated as of 10/01/02.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank,  released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 133,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank(s)  at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.50 miles.\n\nb.  The alt"

      "SummaryText": "ernative release scenario is based on history on the most likely potential incident which is a release from a ruptured hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29  CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves, installation of a bulkhead at the truck unloading point, installation of breakaway fittings at all loading stands, and remote shut-offs for the storage tank(s).  The Company has adopted a plan to bring all facilities and equipment into compliance with the full ANSI standards by the end of 2004.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n   \n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n The facility has:\n\na.  a written EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR1910.120; a copy of the plan has been provided to the local emergency planning authorities.\n\nb.  provided a copy of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) to local authorities.\n\nc.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-k"
