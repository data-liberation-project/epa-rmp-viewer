The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA West Liquid Plant in Centralia are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Boone County Fire Protection District, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of liquid and dry bulk fertilizers, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrients.\n\n    This plan does include predictive filing as delivery by railroad tank car is used for this plan. The maximum quantity stored would be 162,563 pounds in a 37,500 gallon railcar. Product will be typically received by tanker trucks which typically hold 50,000 pounds. The facility has two 30,000 gallon storage tanks which hold approximately 140,196 pounds each. The facility has seventy, 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that when filled would hold approximately 303,450 pounds. There are also two 560 gallon tank applicators that would hold approximately 4,855 pounds. Therefore the facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 751,260 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the railroad tank car released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 162,563 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.7 miles.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3? transfer ho"

      "SummaryText": "se during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1989\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
