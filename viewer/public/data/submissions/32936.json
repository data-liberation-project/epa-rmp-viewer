In addition the relationship of good safety and environmental activities and performance are reflected in the number of HSE awards received by the Henry Plant.  Nevertheless, we welcome the EPA's RMP initiative and see it as an opportunity to continue and expand these activities and to insure our good performance.\n\nII. The Accidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary source\nThe Henry Plant's policy has been to meet or exceed requirements established by applicable safety, health and environmental regulations promulgated by Federal and State agencies.  Our safety policies and practices have historically preceded the regulation of such practices under, for example, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule.  Our policy is to strive for zero OSHA Recordable injuries, Lost Time Injuries, Serious Operational Incidents and Releases to the Environment.  These measurements are tracked on a continuous basis.  The plant also works with on site employees, contractors, suppliers, local emergency responders and the general public to maintain contingency plans and systems to minimize or mitigate an accidental chemical release.  The plant is approaching a milestone called the Trifecta Plus 1 involving no OSHA recordables for one year, no reportable releases to the atmosphere for one year, 3 million hours without a Lost Time Injury and zero NPDES exceedances for one year.\n \nThe plant participates in Responsible Care? under the CCA, and is certified under the ISO-9000 international quality standard.\n\nIII. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe plant has an ongoing program of process safety management (PSM).

This program is identified in SA-49 Mechanical Integrity procedure.\n\n(5) Management of Change: A management of change program has been established for the plant incorporating procedural changes, equipment changes, personnel changes or chemical changes.  Changes to Safety Critical Equipment can not be performed without proper authorization and review.  This program is identified in SA-54 Management of Change procedure and incorporates an electronic database to manage changes plant-wide.\n\nIV.The Five Year Accident History\nThe plant has not had any events at the  Henry plant that would qualify for inclusion in the RMP 5-year accident history.\n\nV. The Emergency Response Program\nThe plant has a series of procedures dealing with emergency response within the facility.  Additionally, it has an Integrated Emergency Plan (SA- 62) that incorporates all of the individual procedures.  The plant maintains an active Fire Brigade of 30+ individuals who are trained for fighting interior structural fires, confined space rescue and spill activities.  Periodic training is provided for this brigade throughout the year including quarterly training exercises, in depth fire training at either Texas A&M Fire School or other appropriate fire schools and annual community drills.  This program is identified in SA-53.\n\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe plant safety program is ongoing through periodic auditing functions conducted by Plant and Corporate Auditing protocols (See SA-57).

The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios:\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios, including a discussion of administrative and engineering measures used to minimize the affects of the release are described below.   One toxic worst case scenario (Chlorine) is provided for the Plant, i.e. the scenario with the farthest endpoint.  One alternative release scenario (more likely scenario) is provided for each toxic chemical (Chlorine, Phosphorus Tri-chloride and Carbon Disulfide).  One flammable worst case scenario (Isobutylene) is provided in addition to one alternative scenario for the same flammable is provided. \n\nA. Toxic Worst Case Scenario: The worst-case scenario for the Plant involves the complete failure of a 90 ton chlorine car which is used to deliver and store chlorine on site.  The distance to the release endpoint would impact beyond our fence line, reaching our industrial neighbors and having the potential of reaching many public receptors.\n\nB. Flammable Worst Case Scenario: The worst-case scenario for the plant involves the complete failure of the isobutylene storage tank containing 88,000 pounds of isobutylene.  The distance to the release endpoint would impact beyond our fence line and potentially reach our immediate industrial neighbors, however, it would not reach any residences.\n \nC. Alternative Release Scenarios(ARS):  ARS's for the Henry Plant include the following.  These releases although unlikely are considered to be more probable than the WCS's listed above.\n\n1. Chlorine (Cl2): A connection hose between the rail car and the process delivery lines ruptures while chlorine is in use.  The leak is just under the flow rate required to lift the excess flow valve that all chlorine cars possess.  The leak occurs for a 3 minute period at a 200 #/"

The leak would be terminated by the automatic closing of emergency actuated valves that are installed on top of the railcars for this type of specific event.  Safeguards:   Safeguards include the excess flow valve on the railcar that actuates whenever the chlorine flow exceeds 250 lbs/minute; Chlorine monitors located around the railcar to notify process personnel in the event of a chlorine leak; TV monitoring system that provides 24 hour surveillance of the car; a trained Hazwoper team that can mitigate the leak using Level A PPE and emergency actuated valves located on top of the chlorine car that automatically close within 6 seconds when a certain chlorine concentration is detected.   Impact Area: The release is calculated to extend beyond our fence line, but would not affect any residential areas.\n\n2. Isobutylene (IB): A connection between the IB truck and the tank farm delivery line leaks when IB is being unloaded.  The leak is just below the actuation flow rate of the excess flow valve located on the truck.  The leak occurs for a five minute period at a 500  lbs/minute rate.  The vapor cloud is ignited as a result of the leak.  The leak is terminated by closing remote actuated valves on the truck unloading line.        Safeguards: The following safeguards are employed: an excess flow valve on the truck which will actuate if flow exceeds  500 lbs/minute; check valve on liquid unloading line preventing liquid from back flowing; remote emergency shutoffs of unloading line; TV monitoring system that provides surveillance of the truck while unloading, a tank farm operator that is assigned to the immediate area of the tank farm during the unloading activity; grounding system to reduce generation of static electricity; and an onsite Fire brigade trained for interior structural fires as well as spill events.  Impact Area: The release is calculated to extend beyond our fence line, but would not affect any residential area.                       "

Approximately, 25 gallons discharge to the pad area.  The pad area drains to the PCl3 dike area.  Safeguards:  Safeguards include periodic change out of the transfer hose; two automatic shutoffs on the truck; unloading is always attended by tank farm operator and truck driver; procedure for unloading; suction is used to unload the truck; pump will automatically stop if no flow; check valves located in unloading line to prevent back flow and trained Hazwoper team along with foam application system for reducing vapor emissions.  Impact Area: The release is calculated to extend beyond the property line but would not affect any residential area. \n\n4. Carbon Disulfide (CS2): The process line from the pump leaks beyond the immediate area of the storage tank while MBT-C process is activating the pump.  The release would not be contained and the leakage would be in the pipe rack located between the tank farm and the process building.  The rate of the leak is estimated at 25 gallons/minute for a period of  15 minutes.  Safeguards: Safeguards include an operator in attendance when pumping carbon disulfide; monitoring of Tank Farm pipe racks twice a day for SPCC check; a trained Hazwoper team; and process procedure established to stop pumping at a specified time and investigate cause of excessive fill time and lined, slightly diked pipe racks.  Impact Area: The release is calculated to extend beyond the property line but would not affect any residential or industrial areas."
