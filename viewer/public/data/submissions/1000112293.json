Jarden Zinc Products is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to both a comprehensive accidental release prevention program and a comprehensive emergency response program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, emergency response, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. In addition, Jarden Zinc Products maintains a strong emergency response program with extensive employee training and interaction with the local fire department responders. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled. We have one (1) regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in a single use.  Chlorine is used for wastewater treatment. The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 360,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the calculations derived from the RMP*Comp software program supplied by EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Storage. The scenario involves the release of 180,000 lbs of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.
