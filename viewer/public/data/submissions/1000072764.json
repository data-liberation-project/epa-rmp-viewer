The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the facility. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios of releases of RMP regulated chemicals caused by equipment failures or human errors.\r\n\r\nAdditional Safety Features\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the facility has many safety features to help prevent the accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. These safety features help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error. These features include but are not limited to: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOperating parameter monitors with alarms\r\n\u00bf\tProcess relief systems\r\n\u00bf\tIsolation valves (manual or automated)\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nDNLA's accident history is included in Section 6 of the RMP. Since DNLA is a relatively new site that has recently started operations, there is no relevant accident history to report at this time. In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, information relating to any accidental release that results in death, injury, significant property damage, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage will be documented for the facility and provided in future RMP submittals.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nDNLA's emergency response program is set forth in its Emergency Procedures Manual. That manual is comprised of numerous relevant sections. Those sections deal with, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee participation \r\n\u00bf\tIncident command management\r\n\u00bf\tR"

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results will be reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audit\r\n\r\nDNLA periodically conducts audits to confirm the procedures and practices required by the chemical accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process. The findings are forwarded to DNLA management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \r\n\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nThe facility's hot work procedure requires that detailed permitting activities take place before, during, and after any job that has the potential to provide a source of ignition. The permit is followed through to completion of the work and those permits are maintained on-site. The facility implements other work permits as necessary to ensure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance and contract personnel.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nDNLA has safe work practices in place to sustain worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure"

DNLA incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This practice assesses suitability of new equipment for its intended use and establishes that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nDNLA has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nDNLA will investigate incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could result in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

DNLA personnel monitor contractor performance to evaluate the level at which contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\n\r\nDNLA conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. This review provides that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to corroborate that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

In addition, the DNLA operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, DNLA has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in DNLA operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\n\r\nDNLA uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, DNLA has procedures in place to provide that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform DNLA personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined.\r\n\r\nDNLA primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\r\n\r\nDNLA periodically updates its process hazard analyses of affected units.

Topics chosen are relevant to respective personnel assigned duties, and general and specific information is provided as informational instruments to enhance employee participation in facility-wide safety performance.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nDNLA keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within DNLA are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, DNLA has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals for each process unit. DNLA promotes maintaining process parameters within limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nDNLA also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construc"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nDNLA is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the plant workers, the public, and the environment. DNLA strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility. DNLA also strives to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. The facility has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is the risk management program which helps manage the risks at the facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Rule 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at the facility. \r\n\r\nThis document satisfies the RMP executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and provides the public with a description of the risk management program at DNLA.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nDNLA's goal at its Program 3 stationary source is accidental release prevention, while maintaining emergency response procedures to minimize consequences in the event of any such release. DNLA maintains a Process Safety Manual directing employees to process safety information in accordance with respective Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management and EPA chemical accident prevention provisions. DNLA also maintains an Emergency Procedures Manual providing necessary information and guidelines to utilize in the event of an emergency situation resulting in accidental release of a regulated substance. DNLA's objective is to train affected employees and contractors in emergency response procedures and requires that emergency response actions are supported by proper consideration for safety, health and welfare of employee"
