This treatment process includes the use of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide in the disinfection process.  This facility takes pride in observing the safety precautions in preventing hazards in the workplace, and possessing structured contingency plans in the unlikely event of a mishap.  \n\nThe City's approach includes (1) the latest technology in monitoring detection systems, and (2) passive mitigation systems designed to diffuse the impact of a release.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis has been performed which produced the following worst case scenarios:\n\n          The rupture of a 2000-pound cylinder containing Chlorine would be limited to 10 minutes \n          in duration, and would release at a rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint \n          under winds of  3.4 miles per hour would be 2.2 miles. \n\n\n          The rupture of a 2000-pound cylinder containing Sulfur Dioxide would be limited to 10\n          minutes in duration, and would release at a rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to\n          the endpoint under winds of  3.4 miles per hour would be 2.1 miles.\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis has been performed which produced the following alternative release scenarios:\n\n          The rupture of a 2000-pound cylinder containing Chlorine would be limited to 10 minutes \n          in duration, and would release at a rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint \n          would be 0.6 miles. \n\n\n          The rupture of a 2000-pound cylinder containing Sulfur Dioxide would be limited to 10\n          minutes in duration, and would release at a rate of 200 pounds per minute.
