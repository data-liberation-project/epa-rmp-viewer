The process equipment is designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards. The unloading hoses are not pressurized, other than to equalize pressure between the tank and the truck during the unloading process.  Hoses are checked for leaks prior to unloading by visual inspection and pressure testing.  Certified operators are trained to familiarize themselves with the emergency shut off system associated with the dedicated propylene oxide trucks which would stop a discharge, should something occur.\n  \nUnloading procedures for the propylene oxide are in place to assure all emergency equipment is functional prior to unloading and that the pumps and systems are leak-free.  Carriers have dedicated propylene oxide trailers that have manual shut off valves, excess flow valves, and other emergency shutoff devices that can be activated on the way out of the area to stop the flow.  Operators are certified in the unloading operation and are required to stay within 25 feet of the truck while unloading is taking place.\n\nThe Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental release events over the past five years involving propylene oxide that have had onsite or offsite impacts.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nASI communicates regularly with the community responders and plant employees participate in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

Typically, propylene oxide is delivered to the plant in tanker trucks which carry approximately 44,000 pounds each.  The truck is parked in the unloading area using procedures that assure the chemical holding portion of the truck is within the protected area.  The protected area has a trench around the perimeter, which is intended to catch any releases of propylene oxide.  The trench drains to a concrete lined neutralization pit where it can be pumped to another container or otherwise controlled.\n\nThe truck is hooked up to the unloading system using dry disconnect, 2-inch, stainless steel wire wrapped, flex hoses.  Dry disconnect fittings prevent release of chemical as the hoses are connected and disconnected.  Propylene oxide is pumped from the truck to the holding tank through stainless steel pipe.  The vapor associated with the unloading procedure is vented back to the truck with no release to the atmosphere.  A pressure relieving system is in place to release pressure in unloading lines to a scrubber.   The tank sits within a concrete containment dike which is inspected annually.  Se"

      "SummaryText": "1.0\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAshland Specialty Ingredients, GP (ASI) currently owns and operates a guar manufacturing plant located at One Mill Street, Kenedy, Karnes County, Texas.  Plant processes include bulk storage of guar splits, alteration by chemical addition, and grinding.  This facility is an agricultural-based processing plant approximately 27.533 acres in area and began operation in October 1953.  Guar flour and its derivatives are produced at the plant.  Operations are scheduled 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.  Normal operations require approximately 52 employees, including office and production workers. \n\nPropylene oxide is delivered to the plant in tanker trucks and stored in a bulk storage tank. It is a listed regulated substance used in the P80 process. ASI uses Propylene Oxide above the threshold quantity and is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations define a Program 3 process to be one that has the potential for offsite impacts from a release and is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program or is classified in one of nine Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.\n\nBecause Propylene Oxide is regulated for risk of accidental release, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that an RMP be utilized for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases. This Risk Management Plan has been developed in accordance with Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions under 40 CFR part 68 to provide guidance on how to prevent, prepare for and respond to a chemical emergency involving propylene oxide.\n\nThe Offsite Consequences Analysis\nThe population estimates are very conservative (the numbers are likely higher than in the year 2010 - U.S. Census).  MARPLOT is used to calculate the population within the area plotted by ALOHA.  The 2010 Census data shows population for the City of Kenedy is 3296.  The 2022 RMP update uses EPA RMP*Comp to calculate distance to the Toxic End Point for the worst case and"
