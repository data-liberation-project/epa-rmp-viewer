      "SummaryText": "7.0  RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND DATA ELEMENTS\n\nThe following subsections outline the Executive Summary requirements of the EPA's 40 CFR Part 68.155.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 80501 facility abides by the emergency response procedures and policies detailed in the Emergency Response Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)    To save lives.\n2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)    To protect the environment.\n4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\nAmeriCold Logistics maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n    The AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 80501 facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid"

      "SummaryText": ".  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 6\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\n    Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n    The total ammonia inventory is 19361 pounds.  \n\n HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\n    Scenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (accounting for administrative controls) - 3316 lbs. pounds - in 10 minutes.  No passive mitigation measures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  Reference Table 15 from the EPA RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document was used. See Appendix A. The toxic endpoint was determined using EPA's \"RMP -Comp\" computer \n    program downloaded from their Website.\n\n\n    Distance to Toxic Endpoint: The one hour, time averaged concentration of 200 ppm (0.14 mg/L) reached 1.8 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\n    Scenario Description: A 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 6000 pounds.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters/second wind speed, and D stability.  Reference Table 5 from the EPA RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document was used. See Appendix A.  The toxic endpoint was determined using EPA's \"RMP -Comp\" computer \n    program downloaded from their Website.\n\n    Distance to Toxic Endpoint: The one hour, time averaged concentration of 200 ppm (0.14 mg/L) reached  .31 miles\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\n    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria fo"

Plant 80501 has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910.119 regulation since 5-10-94\n\n FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reported releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years 6-21-94 through 6-21-99.\n\n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 80501 has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\nDuring the RMP Development Review, it was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures.  In addition, it was recommended that the facility contact the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDuring the development of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the initial Process Hazard Analysis study (5-10-94) generated mitigation measures that would improve safety at the AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 80501 facility located at 755 E. 1700 South in Clearfield, Utah.  These action items are as follows:\n\nR-03  Complete all Operating Procedures for Process Equipment\nR-04  Replace all relief valves on a (5) year schedule and document results\nR-07  Install Ammonia detection system in Engine Room and Warehouse areas and tie into King          Valve solenoid switch\nR-08  Install Engine Room exhaust fans for ventilation\nR-14  Install Emergency Kill switch outside of Engine Room\n\nIn addition to the equipment related mitigation measures recommended to improve safety "
