Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe ER Systems Garden Grove facility is located at 12271 Monarch Street, Garden Grove, CA 92841.\n\nER Systems Garden Grove has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785). The ER Systems Garden Grove facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The Program 1 processes exclusively include the Toluene Diisocyanate Storage Tank and Isophorone Diisocyanate Storage Tank.\n\nThe ER Systems Garden Grove facility is a manufacturer of Elastomeric Coatings, Sealants and Membranes. Toluene Diisocyanate (greater than 99% by weight) and Isophorone Diisocyanate (greater than 99% by weight) are used in the formation of polyurethane sealants and coatings.  For modeling purposes, the largest vessels (the storage tanks) containing Toluene Diisocyanate and Isophorone Diisocyanate were used.   The maximum capacities of the storage tanks are 10,000 gallons Toluene Diisocyanate and 10,000 gallons Isophorone Diisocyanate.\n\n3.2.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Planning Policies\n\nER Systems Garden Grove has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Toluene Diisocyanate and Isophorone Diisocyanate Storage Tanks. ER Systems Garden Grove's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nER Systems Garden Grove's emergency planning policies include the development of an emergency action plan, which addresses emergencies such as a fire, earthquake, and hazardous material release that may occur at the facility. Periodic training on the plan is gi"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCalARP Program 1 does not require a Prevention Program. However, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed when handling Toluene Diisocyanate and Isophorone Diisocyanate.    \n\n3.4.    Five Year Accident History \n\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of Toluene Diisocyanate or Isophorone Diisocyanate at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.\n\n3.5.    Emergency Response Program \n\nER Systems Garden Grove facility has submitted a Business Emergency Plan and Hazardous Materials Disclosure to the Orange County Fire Department in order to coordinate with the local emergency planning and response agencies to ensure that in an event of an emergency they are properly prepared and have knowledge of the system.\n\n3.6.    Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nER Systems Garden Grove facility is extremely diligent in the handling of Toluene Diisocyanate and Isophorone Diisocyanate. In the event of a release of either chemical, no Toluene Diisocyanate or Isophorone Diisocyanate will travel offsite or reach any sensitive receptors. At this point, ER Systems Garden Grove feels confident in the system arrangement, therefore there are no current improvements to be made. \n\n"
