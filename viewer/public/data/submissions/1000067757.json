      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\n\n\n Sandvik, Inc. (Sandvik) blends tungsten carbide powders, cobalt and other raw materials to produce cemented carbide cutting inserts at its Westminster, SC facility.     In the powder plant, purchased powder metal components are blended to a recipe, processed through ball mills to achieve a homogenous mix of the correct grain size, and then dried in a spray drier to remove (and recover) the water-ethanol mix used in the ball mills.  The finished powder is then packaged for shipment to other facilities or used to produce cutting inserts at the Westminster insert production facility.\n\n\n\nProcess operations in the insert production facility include powder pressing, sintering, grinding, washing/cleaning, coating (Physical Vapor Deposition or PVD, or Chemical Vapor Deposition or CVD), laser marking, and packaging.  The facility NAICS code is 333515.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\n\n\nThe chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coating furnace process uses titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and other chemicals to provide a layer of titanium carbonitride coating to the cemented carbide cutting tool inserts.  Up to May 2018, the quantity of titanium tetrachloride on any one process has been less than 2500 pounds, which is the threshold quantity for regulation under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 and SC Regulation 61-62.68. However, beginning in May 2018, Sandvik plans to use 3800 pound cylinders to supply TiCl4 to the CVD furnaces, making the process subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (Risk Management Plan).\n\n\n\nThe exact mix of gases used in an individual furnace recipe depends on the exact type of coating required for the work piece. Each line will be fed from a dedicated 1,000 liter titanium tetrachloride supply cylinder and each line will be attached to dedicated scrubber for the control of exhaust gases from the furnaces.   \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nTitanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), used to provide a source of t"

      "SummaryText": "itanium in CVD furnaces, is regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 and South Carolina Regulation 61-62.68 as a toxic substance.  TiCl4 will be supplied to the two coating lines from a stainless steel storage cylinder with a maximum capacity of 1,000 liters (264 gallons).  At the working capacity of 1,000 liters, each cylinder holds approximately, 3,800 pounds of TiCl4.  In addition to the two cylinders connected to the individual CVD Lines, a total of four additional tanks are stored on-site as reserve tanks in segregated enclosed structures or in the current storage sheds. This brings the maximum inventory on-site to 6,000 liters (1505 gallons and approximately 23,000 pounds).  These cylinders are not interconnected, so that a release from one cylinder would not trigger a release from another cylinder.\n\n\n\nTiCl4 is a liquid stored under atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions. TiCl4 is delivered to the CVD system by a low pressure argon supply.  In the event of a release, TiCl4 rapidly breaks down to hydrochloric acid when exposed to water or atmospheric moisture.   \n\n\n\nTitanium tetrachloride is corrosive and highly irritating to the skin, eyes, mucus membrane, and respiratory tract.  Acute exposure may result in surface skin burns and congestion and contraction of the upper respiratory tract.   Environmental exposure beyond the area of a release is unlikely because titanium tetrachloride reacts rapidly with water, including moisture in the air.  However, the hydrolysis product is hydrochloric acid is which is a corrosive, irritating substance.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nSandvik is committed to the safety of its associates and the public.  Sandvik has operated CVD furnace operations at this location since 2005; during its operating history, Sandvik has not experienced a reportable TiCl4 release or a release that caused any injuries or illnesses to Sandvik employees or the public.  \n\n\n\nEng"

      "SummaryText": "ineering and administrative controls to prevent accidental releases and minimize the consequences of releases include the following:\n\n\n\n1.  All personnel working in and around the CVD area are thoroughly trained in operations, maintenance, chemical safety and emergency response.\n\n2.  All standby TiCl4 cylinders are stored in individual cabinets that would minimize the consequences of any potential releases.  Cylinders are not inter-connected.\n\n3.  All in-service cylinders are located in one of two enclosed scrubber rooms.\n\n4.  The scrubber room is equippped with hydrochloric acid mist (reaction by-product of TiCl4 and moisture) sensors and alarms,  a neutralizing wet scrubber with vacuum collection system to collect and treat any vapors, sprinklers, and video cameras to allow remote monitoring of conditions in the room.\n\n5.  Maintenance and inspections are performed daily on the delivery system.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario has been determined to be a failure of the braided stainless steel transfer tubing (called a \"pigtail\") from the supply cylinder to the furnace line.  This pigtail holds 0.08 gallons (1.2 lbs) which would be the normal maximum amount that could be released.  The pigtail is isolated from the supply cylinder so that additional releases are not possible.\n\n\n\nThe alternate (most likely) release scenario would be the failure to properly purge the pigtail delivery line prior to performing maintenance activities.  The maximum release in this scenario is 0.08 gallons (1.2 lbs).  This would also occur in the scrubber room which as the engineering and administrative controls listed above.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nSandvik has a written emergency response plan (ERP) that is coordinated with the Oconee County Emergency Planning Commission. The ERP identifies potential hazards associated with facility activities and identifies emergency response personnel, including emergency coordinators, emergency response and fire response teams, hazmat inciden"
