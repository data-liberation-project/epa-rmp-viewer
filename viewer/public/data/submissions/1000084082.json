Lineage Logistics has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nLineage Logistics has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nLineage Logistics has an Emergency Response Plan in place to properly prepare for emergency evacuations, to provide first aid and medical treatment and to contact federal, state and local officials in the event of a major release of ammonia, and procedures for handling small releases. If an emergency were to occur, it is Lineage's policy to notify the LEPC, the local Fire Department, and respond to the emergency. A site-specific emergency plan has been developed to address emergencies.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAll recommendations that were generated by the initial PHA and subsequent MOC's have been addressed. Any new equipment installed in the future will incorporate new safety design and technology available at the time of installation. If, based upon mechanical integrity inspections, improvements are necessary, they will be performed in a timely fashion."

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nLineage Logistics conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nLineage Logistics promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nLineage Logistics believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
