The NGS is one of three electrical generating stations located throughout the city that are part of the JEA Power Business Unit.  JEA is committed to operating this system and other JEA systems and facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of JEA and Contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  In addition, JEA is committed to operating this and other JEA facilities in full compliance with all applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the System is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, JEA has developed this Risk Management Plan (the Plan).  Among the important components of this Plan are JEA's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the Facility, and JEA's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Facility. \n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nJEA operates two systems at the facility that uses aqueous ammonia (concentration greater than 20%) - the West Tank system and East Tank system - as shown in Figure 1.  Further description of these tank systems follows.\n\nWest Tank Aqueous Ammonia System\n\nThe Units 1 & 2 Repowering Project is equipped with an aqueous ammonia injection system designed to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to acceptable limits.  This system is referred to as the West Tank. Ammonia is stored in a 40,000-gallon cylindrical aboveground tank surrounded by a concrete containment dike.  Ammonia is injected into the process at the hot cyclone inlets of each boiler to reduce NOx emissions.  Oxid"

      "SummaryText": "es of nitrogen are generated within the boiler during the combustion process.  \nEast Tank Aqueous Ammonia System\n\nAnother aqueous ammonia system, referred to as the East Tank, is used for the control of pH in the boiler condensate water for Units 1, 2 & 3. Ammonia is stored in a 6,000-gallon cylindrical aboveground tank surrounded by a concrete containment dike.  For both systems, aqueous ammonia is delivered to the Facility via tanker truck.\n\n\n\n1.3 WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n                                                                                                                                                                       The worst case release scenario is the 10-minute release of the contents of the full contents of the largest tank, or 40,000 gallons, as required by applicable Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations. \n\nIn addition to assuming a release of the worst case quantity, the worst case scenario includes other worst case assumptions, such as a low wind speed (1.5 meters per second (m/s)), a highly stable atmosphere (Class F), and the maximum ambient temperature over a three year period (100oF).  Using the EPA program RMP Comp, these worst case assumptions result in a distance to the toxic endpoint 0.1 miles from the point of release.  This distance is significantly mitigated due to the presence of the containment dike.  Although this release could migrate off site, there are no residential or environmental receptors within the radius.\n\nA more realistic, alternative release scenario also was examined.  For this scenario, it was assumed that a flange leak resulted in a release of 100 gallons of aqueous ammonia over a period of 30 minutes.  Again, using RMP Comp, these alternative case assumptions result in distance to the toxic endpoint less than 0.1 miles from the point of release.  This scenario does not result in an off-site release. \n\n\n1.4 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has an aggressive accide"

      "SummaryText": "ntal release prevention program that is based upon a foundation of employee awareness and proactive system maintenance.  This program is documented in this integrated Plan.\n\n\n1.5 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere was one accidental release at the Facility in the five years prior to the date of this Plan that resulted in injuries to Facility employees on site.  On June 14, 2000, ammonia vapors exited the tank vent line during routine filling at a higher than normal flow rate.  Four employees required oxygen and a medical examination. As a result of that incident, JEA modified the tank filling procedure to reduce the possibility of filling the tank at an excessive rate.\n\n\n1.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by Facility employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  This ERP has been communicated to the City of Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department (JFRD) and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The JEA is currently in the process of revising the Facility ERP.  With regard to public notification of a chemical release that has the potential to go off site, the JFRD is presently responsible for determining when evacuation of off-site areas is necessary and for public notification.\n\n\n1.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis Plan incorporates a number of modifications to Facility procedures designed to improve employee safety awareness, enhance safe operations and maintenance of the aqueous ammonia system, reduce the potential for accidental releases to occur, and increase the speed and effectiveness of the Facility's response should a release occur."
