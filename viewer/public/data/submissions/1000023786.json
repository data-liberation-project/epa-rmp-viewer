      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies :\n\nAir Products and Chemicals Inc. owns and operates the Vernon Plant. Air Products is the industry leader in environmental, health and safety performance. The company is committed to compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws, continual improvement with the ultimate goal of zero injuries and zero emissions of hazardous materials, designing and operating plants in a manner that protects people and the environment, development of products that can be manufactured, distributed, used and recycled or disposed in a safe and environmentally sound manner and active participation in Responsible Care and similar iniatives. \n\nListed below are various programs established at the Vernon Plant that protect the environment and ensure the safety of its workers and neighbors.\n\n-Process Safety Management\n-Basic Safety Process\n-Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures \n-Hazardous Waste Management\n-Stormwater Pollution Prevention\n-Emergency and Contingency Plan\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe Vernon Plant operates four major reactors that manufacture mainly epoxy curing agents. Epoxy curing agents are used to manufacture paints, adhesives, composite materials and civil engineering floors. The plant's process uses various types of amines and modifies its properties using solvents, resins and other chemicals to make it easier to handle for consumers. Ethylenediamine (CAS# 107-15-3) and a 37% solution of formaldehyde (CAS # 50-0-0) in water are the two raw materials used on site that are on the Regulated substance list and have exceeded the threshold quantity. \n\nEthylenediamine is used in the manufacture of amine adducts. Ethylenediamine is received in 55 gallon drums. Ethylenediamine is tranferred to the reactor and processed. The resulting finished product can contain small amounts of ethylediamine. The excess unreacted ethylenediamine is collected and stored in to"

Formaldehyde is delivered via tank trucks and is stored in a double walled stainless steel underground storage tank. The formaldehyde is delivered to the reactors by a series of pumps and pipes. Once in the system, formaldehyde stays contained in the system. All the formaldehyde is consumed once it enters the reactors. The finished product does not contain any residual formaldehyde. The reaction is irreversible and exothermic. \n\n3. General accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe facility developed a prevention program based on the elements of the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program, the California Accidental Release Program and OSHA's Process Safety Mangement regulation.\n\nThe facility's PSM procedure will act as an overview of the various plant systems and procedures already in place to meet the guidelines set forth by OSHA Rule 1910.119 Process Safety Management. \n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nThe facility has had no accidents involving releases of ethylenediamine or formaldehyde that resulted in any deaths, injuries, significant property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThe facility is included in the written community emergency response plan.\n\nThe facility's emergency action plan is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard. Employees have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level. The employees receive annual refresher training in their roles in the emergency plan. Employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agancies. The Vernon Fire Department responds to all types of emergencies that occur at the facility. The plant personnel performs annual emergency drills with the Vernon Fire Department.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and inci"
