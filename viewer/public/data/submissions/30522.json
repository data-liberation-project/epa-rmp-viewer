      "SummaryText": "World Citrus West, Inc:\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nWorld Citrus West, Inc. is a juice processing and packaging facility (NAICS Code 311411) using one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the facility?s refrigeration process.  The refrigeration process is an integral part of processing, storing and preserving the facility?s juice products. \n\nJuice arrives at the facility via trucks from various fruit processing facilities, including its Florida facilities.  The juice arrives chilled and is held in chilled storage to await packaging.  The juice is then processed and packaged into finished product and stored in chilled warehouses to await shipment to customers.\n\nThe facility?s refrigeration process is divided into two separate systems.  The larger of the two systems provides refrigeration for the processing and packing functions at the facility.  This system has a maximum intended inventory of the regulated substance above the threshold quantity.  The second system provides refrigeration for the facility?s chilled warehouse space.  The second system?s maximum intended inventory is below the threshold quantity, however this system is maintained to the same standards as the larger system.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Procedures:\n\nThe facility has proactive safety programs, including an extensive Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.  The facility works diligently to provide a safe working environment for its employees and to prevent any accidental release of the regulated substance that may impact the facility or its surrounding community.  The facility?s ARP program combines and satisfies both the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s Process Safety Management program.\n\nThe ARP program ensures that the processes are designed, installed, maintained, modified and opera"

      "SummaryText": "ted in a safe manner.  Participation by the facility?s employees is a key ingredient in the development, implementation and maintenance of each of the ARP program?s elements.  The program elements include policies and procedures regarding employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training employees on procedures, contractors? safety, pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, permitting for hot work, management of process changes, emergency planning and response, compliance audits and offsite consequence analysis.\n\nTrained employees perform routine monitoring of the systems to assure system deviations are quickly addressed.  All employees and contractors that work on or around the covered process are trained in the hazards of the processes.  Contractors are pre-approved by the safety department to ensure safe work standards are followed at any work site within the facility.\n\nThe facility has installed safety devices to reduce the risk of an accidental release of the regulated substance and to minimize the impact should an accidental release occur.   One of the safety devices is an automated control system that can automatically shutdown the system in the event of a system deviation that may result in a release.  Another safety feature of the facility?s process is an ammonia leak detection system with sensors installed throughout key areas of the facility to provide early warning of a release.  The detection system is connected to the control system, which sounds an alarm to notify employees and begins an automated shutdown of the process.  The facility has also installed a public address and alarm system to notify employees of a plant evacuation in the event it is required.  Employee training is conducted for evacuation procedures upon hire and refreshed annually.  All facility employees participate in annual plant evacuation drills.\n\n\nEmergency Response Policies and Procedures:\n\nThe facility has implemented an"

The facility?s emergency response plan consists of employee notification (alarm) and evacuation, followed by notification of the appropriate local and national emergency agencies.  The facility?s employees do not respond to accidental releases, however the facility?s employees will fully cooperate and assist emergency agencies to the best of their capabilities.  Designated Maintenance personnel have received hazardous material training to the technician level in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(iii) and key management personnel have received hazardous material training to the 8 hour awareness level. All key personnel are trained in emergency process shutdown procedures.  A facility evacuation plan has been developed, disseminated to facility employees and included in the Emergency Response Plan documentation.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThe facility is proud of its past record of having no accidental releases that resulted in on-site injuries, deaths, significant property damage or any off-site injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\nThe facility did have a release incident, on June 29, 2000, that resulted in the evacuation of the plant.  The incident was caused by a loss of water pressure to part of the process resulting in a pressure safety relief valve opening.  The valve released ammonia vapor into the atmosphere as designed to prevent over pressurization of the system.  Emergency agencies closed the surrounding streets and intersections until the release could be contained.  The incident resulted in no injuries, deaths, damage, public evacuations or sheltering in place.  Since the incident, process controls have been upgraded to automatically shut down the process to prevent a reoccurrence.\n\n\nPlanned Process Safety Improvements:\n\nThe facility is c"

The facility routinely holds process safety management meetings to discuss results of mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigations and management of changes.  \n\nThe facility is currently investigating consolidating the refrigeration needs into one system.  This will reduce the total inventory of the regulated substance at the facility and the amount of equipment and piping needed to operate the system.  This would reduce the exposure to a potential accidental release and the severity of a release."
