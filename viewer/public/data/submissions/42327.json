Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Helm Fertilizer Terminal, Inc. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\n\n\n    General\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers and co-ops.\n\n\n\n    Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\n    Butane\n\n\n\nButane is stored on-site infrequently.  It is received, stored, and re-distributed under contract with a local producer.\n\n\n\n3.    The Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of listed hazardous chemicals in the past five years that; (a) have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor (b) to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n4.    The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n5.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.\n\n\n\n* * *   End of Executive "
