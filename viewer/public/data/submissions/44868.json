Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Don Keys Fertilizer Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Edgar County ESDA, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  \n  The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers. The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designated for this purpose.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenerio and Alternate Release Scenerio: \n  An analysis of the potential off site consequenses of hypothetical worst case and alternative case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assesment and information in our Risk Management Program.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n  The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia. The OSHA standard is referenced in the RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b). \n\n5 Five Year Accident History\n  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at this facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our emergency action plan.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility. We will keep in continual contact with local authorities concerning theft problems for drug use and will, as soon as available, add any product to the anhdrous ammonia that will make it unusable for drug use. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
