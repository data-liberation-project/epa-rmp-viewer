Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nYale Security Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with either the Knoxville or Lenoir City Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacture of locks for the building and hardware industry.  We have 1 regulated substance (chlorine) present at our facility.  Chlorine is used for the treatment of plating waste containing cyanide in our wastewater treatment plant.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 8,000 pounds; however, usual inventory amounts are between 2,000 and 4,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nYale facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the manufacturers suggested design parameters).  The chlorine process is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The two programs were overlapped wherever possible as recommended by the EPA.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nYale Security I"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is     what-if/checklists.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at an interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Yale Security Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nYale Security Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nYale Security Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on chlorine process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, and vent systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized tra"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner usually by the manufacture of the equipment in question.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Yale Security Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Yale Security Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nYale Security Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years in coordination with the process hazard analysis review and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nYale Security Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nYale Security Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all informatio"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Yale Security Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\n\nYale Security Inc. has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\n\nYale Security Inc. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nLoudon County Emergency Management Association is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.
