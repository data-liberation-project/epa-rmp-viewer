      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nDuck River Utility Commission\nTullahoma, Tennessee\n\nThe Duck River Utility Commission operates a potable water filtration plant and related facilities on TVA's Normandy Reservoir near Tullahoma, Tennessee.  The DRUC is committed to providing pure and plentiful potable water to the Manchester and Tullahoma communities as well as protecting the safety of its employees, the community and the environment.  The Commission takes great pride in observing stringent industrial safety precautions in preventing hazards in the workplace, and possessing fail-safe contingency plans in the unlikely event of a mishap. This two-pronged approach includes the following: \n\n1. The latest technology in process controls and monitoring detection systems. \n2. Active and passive mitigation systems designed to defuse the impact of leakage, fire, or explosion.\n\nThe DRUC stores and utilized one ton cylinders of liquefied chlorine gas for the disinfection processes at the Water Treatment Plant.  There are normally two or three full and two or three empty cylinders stored at the facility inside a brick and block building.  These containers of liquefied chlorine are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Plan program.   An extensive Process Hazard Analysis has been performed by the DRUC which produced the following worst-case scenario:\n\nA rupture of a 2,000 pound cylinder containing liquefied chlorine in a ten-minute release of chlorine gas into the air.  The DRUC stores the cylinders inside a brick building that will slow the release of the chlorine gas to the outside.  The distance to toxic endpoint under winds of 1.5 meters per second is 0.9 miles.  Since the DRUC facility is in a remote area, very few occupied premises will be effected.  There are an estimated fifteen residences or forty-five persons inside the evacuation perimeter.\n\nAn alternate release scenario has also been consider under the following conditions:\nA leak in a cylinder valve or pipe containing chlorine "

      "SummaryText": "gas results in a fifteen-minute release of fifteen hundred pounds of chlorine gas into the air.  The DRUC stores the cylinders inside a brick building that will slow the release of the chlorine gas to the outside.  The distance to toxic endpoint under winds of 3.0 meters per second is 0.2 miles.  Since the DRUC facility is in a remote area, very few occupied premises will be effected.  There are an estimated zero residences or five persons inside the evacuation perimeter.\n\nThe DRUC has an excellent accident and chemical release prevention program.  The reportable spill or release history of the Commission includes zero spillage, zero deaths, and zero worker injuries.  The DRUC has implemented stringent loading, operation and maintenance procedures to prevent the accidental release of chlorine gas.\n\nOur Emergency Response Program has been perfected to produce the maximum effective impact in the least amount of time.  The DRUC has coordinated with all local governments and fire departments to provide effective communications and rapid response in an emergency situation.  The DRUC staff will respond immediately to a release event by taking the following basic actions: \n\n1. Dial 911.  Notify the Coffee County Emergency Management Agency.\n2. Contact the fire department hazard response team.\n3. Evacuate the DRUC facilities and the appropriate perimeter area.\n\nPlanned changes as a result of our last safety review include: \n1. Replace the chlorine handling and feed system with a state of the art new system. \n2. Install new state of the art chlorine leak detection systems.\n3. Install a chlorine gas containment and scrubber system.\n\nQuestions about this program or the chemical storage at the DRUC facilities may be directed to Randal J. Braker, General Manager at (931) 455-6458."
