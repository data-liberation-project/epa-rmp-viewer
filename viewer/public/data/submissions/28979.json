Oxy Vinyls, LP (OxyVinyls) is a joint venture between Occidental Chemical Corporation (a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation) and The Geon Company.  The facility is located near the Houston Ship Channel at 2400 Miller Cut-Off Road.  It was originally constructed in 1973 and currently employs 160 full time employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (? 68.155(a)):\nOxy Vinyls is committed to operating the La Porte VCM Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules/regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyVinyls has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the La Porte VCM Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program for the La Porte VCM Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the La Porte VCM Plant consists of the following three elements:\n? A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule;\n? A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the covered processes containing, or with the potential of involving, more than a threshold quantit"

When a hazardous substance is used, the plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance (which could adversely affect plant workers, the public or the environment) and take steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility?s Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) procedures, which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyVinyls strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility:  Oxy Vinyls implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at the La Porte VCM Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines are also used when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, OxyVinyls requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.  OxyVinyls? mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxyVinyls? goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release:  In the event of an accidental release,"

OxyVinyls utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation and trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  OxyVinyls also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office and the Houston area to assist workers, their families and the public during and after all emergencies.  In addition, the La Porte VCM Plant actively works with CIMA (Channel Industries Mutual Aid), the La Porte and Deer Park Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC?s), and other local emergency service providers to help prevent and/or address public exposure or environmental damage in case a release does occur.  The La Porte VCM Plant, in conjunction with the East Harris County Manufacturers Association (EHCMA), has assisted the La Porte LEPC in installation of the city wide emergency broadcast system and developed/implemented a RMP public communications plan.  The La Porte VCM Plant promotes the use of the Community Awareness & Emergency Response (CAER) Phone Hotline (281-476-CAER or 281-476-CARE) to inform the citizens of any unusual plant event and actively works with the La Porte Citizens? Advisory Panel.\n\nThe La Porte VCM Plant?s emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, and EPA regulations, as well as OxyVinyls? guidelines.  This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required for control of an emergency within the boundaries of the La Porte VCM Plant.

The group meets monthly and covers topics of interest, to the members, including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, health issues and process safety performance.  Through this outreach effort, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays informed of community concerns and works to address them.\n\nA Plant Manager?s Safety Council, with representation from all departments including the permanent contractor, meets at least monthly to promote dialog between employees and management, to oversee and promote plant safety, and participates in safety audits.\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "Plant Vinyl Chloride Process is considered a Program 3 process. \n\nEthylene, Chlorine and Hydrochloric Acid are the primary feedstocks for the La Porte VCM Plant.  These materials are primarily delivered to the plant by pipeline.  Ethylene and chlorine are reacted to form ethylene dichloride (EDC).  The EDC is purified and fed to a cracking furnace where it is processed to form vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  A hydrochloric acid (HCl) by-product, along with supplemental HCl from outside sources, is reacted to form more EDC.  The vinyl chloride monomer is then purified and stored in storage tanks prior to shipment by pipeline or railcar to other sites (OxyVinyls or others).  \n\nPropylene is used as a refrigerant similar to Freon to cool and condense gases and liquids in the purification process.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a nutritional feed supplement for the microorganisms that help purify the plant?s waste water.\n\nChloroform and Ethyl Chloride are impurities formed in the production of EDC.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (? 68.155(c)):\nThe La Porte VCM Plant performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for the accidental release of a regulated substance that might affect the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst case release scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario.\"  In reality, however, OxyVinyls does not expect a worst-case release scenario to occur.  The alternative release scenarios were developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  \n\nThe EPA Look-Up Tables were used for evaluating the distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release scenarios and the alternate release scenarios.  Various sources (Landview, USGS maps, and DeLorme Street Atlas USA) were used to estimate the number of "
