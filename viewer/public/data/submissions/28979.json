An \u00bfalternate release scenario\u00bf involves the failure of a 1-inch pipe nipple which could release up to 24,000 pounds of a chloroform mixture.

It is assumed that the vinyl chloride vaporizes within the 10-minute time period to form a vapor cloud.  The worst case release scenario then assumes a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to a 1-psi (pound per square inch) overpressure could then be 1.15 miles. No residential population would be affected.  Public receptors include only area industrial facilities; and an environmental receptor could include a state park.\n\nAn \u00bfalternate release scenario\u00bf involves a 2-inch pipeline rupture (with emergency shutdown isolation) over 20-minutes, which could release 62,840 pounds of vinyl chloride.  This could result in an endpoint distance of 0.21 miles. This scenario would not affect a residential population.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a7 68.155(d)):\nThe La Porte VCM Plant developed a prevention program to further prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances in accordance with the Codes and associated Management Practices of Responsible Care in 1990.  Beginning in 1992, the plant revised these prevention programs to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  RMP\u00bfs Program 3, applicable for flammable and toxic substances at this site, is basically the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment outside the plant\u00bfs boundaries.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the La Porte VCM Plant\u00bfs RMP Program 3 prevention plan that address EPA's RMP requirements.\n\n4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\nThe La Porte VCM Plant's Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n4.1.1 Process Safety Information\nThe La Porte VCM Plant maintains technical documents, which are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes. These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  OxyVinyls ensures that this process safety information is up-to-date and available to all employees."

Oxy Vinyls, LP (OxyVinyls) is a joint venture between Occidental Chemical Corporation (a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation) and The Geon Company.  The facility is located near the Houston Ship Channel at 2400 Miller Cut-Off Road.  It was originally constructed in 1973 and currently employs 160 full time employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (\u00a7 68.155(a)):\nOxy Vinyls is committed to operating the La Porte VCM Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules/regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyVinyls has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the La Porte VCM Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program for the La Porte VCM Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the La Porte VCM Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\u00bf A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule;\n\u00bf A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the covered processes containing, or with the potential of involving, more than a threshold quantit"

When a hazardous substance is used, the plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance (which could adversely affect plant workers, the public or the environment) and take steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility\u00bfs Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) procedures, which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyVinyls strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility:  Oxy Vinyls implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at the La Porte VCM Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines are also used when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, OxyVinyls requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.  OxyVinyls\u00bf mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxyVinyls\u00bf goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release:  In the event of an accidental release,"

OxyVinyls utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation and trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  OxyVinyls also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office and the Houston area to assist workers, their families and the public during and after all emergencies.  In addition, the La Porte VCM Plant actively works with CIMA (Channel Industries Mutual Aid), the La Porte and Deer Park Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC\u00bfs), and other local emergency service providers to help prevent and/or address public exposure or environmental damage in case a release does occur.  The La Porte VCM Plant, in conjunction with the East Harris County Manufacturers Association (EHCMA), has assisted the La Porte LEPC in installation of the city wide emergency broadcast system and developed/implemented a RMP public communications plan.  The La Porte VCM Plant promotes the use of the Community Awareness & Emergency Response (CAER) Phone Hotline (281-476-CAER or 281-476-CARE) to inform the citizens of any unusual plant event and actively works with the La Porte Citizens\u00bf Advisory Panel.\n\nThe La Porte VCM Plant\u00bfs emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, and EPA regulations, as well as OxyVinyls\u00bf guidelines.

These materials are primarily delivered to the plant by pipeline.  Ethylene and chlorine are reacted to form ethylene dichloride (EDC).  The EDC is purified and fed to a cracking furnace where it is processed to form vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  A hydrochloric acid (HCl) by-product, along with supplemental HCl from outside sources, is reacted to form more EDC.  The vinyl chloride monomer is then purified and stored in storage tanks prior to shipment by pipeline or railcar to other sites (OxyVinyls or others).  \n\nPropylene is used as a refrigerant similar to Freon to cool and condense gases and liquids in the purification process.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a nutritional feed supplement for the microorganisms that help purify the plant\u00bfs waste water.\n\nChloroform and Ethyl Chloride are impurities formed in the production of EDC.\n\n3.
