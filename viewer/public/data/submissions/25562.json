Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Ainsworth) are\n     committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and\n     propane. Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's\n     job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement\n     appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an\n     accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency\n     Action Plan and is prepared to work with local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning\n     Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of \n     the release to employees, the environment, and general public.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. \n     Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one 30,000-gallon storage tank. This tank\n     is located in the Northeast corner of the facility. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia \n     stored in this stationary point would be 131,000 pounds.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also stored in\n     61-1000 gal wagons which are stored in the Southwest corner of the facility.  The maximum\n     quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in this stationary point would be 268,000 pounds.  Propane\n     is stored in two 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  These tanks are located at the East Plant.  The\n     maximum quantity of propane stored would be 188,700-pounds.  The maximum fill level of each\n     tank is 85% of the total capacity, which is controlle"

Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     1) Safety Equipment: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable\n     Federal and State of Iowa regulators.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are\n     periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety\n     Data Sheets, equipment specifications and codes and standards used to build and operate\n     the anhydrous ammonia and propane equipment are maintained at the facility.\n\n     2) Hazard Review: Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the\n     handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  The reviews identify the opportunity\n     for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards\n     used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.\n     The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written procedures for the handling and storage of\n     anhydrous ammonia and propane.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the\n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.111,\"Storage and\n     Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
