The written procedures\n     are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n     4)  Training: All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training\n     program.  Training of all employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g. reading safety\n     information, operating procedures, response measures followed by a written test) and on-the-job\n     supervision.

The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable\n     in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  Corrective actions required\n     as a result of each compliance audit will be performed and documented.\n\n     7) Incident Investigation: Facility management will investigate each incident that results, or could have\n     reasonably resulted in a catastropic release of anhydrous ammonia or propane.

Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Ainsworth) are\n     committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and\n     propane. Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's\n     job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement\n     appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an\n     accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency\n     Action Plan and is prepared to work with local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning\n     Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of \n     the release to employees, the environment, and general public.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. \n     Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one 30,000-gallon storage tank. This tank\n     is located in the Northeast corner of the facility. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia \n     stored in this stationary point would be 131,000 pounds.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also stored in\n     61-1000 gal wagons which are stored in the Southwest corner of the facility.  The maximum\n     quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in this stationary point would be 268,000 pounds.  Propane\n     is stored in two 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  These tanks are located at the East Plant.  The\n     maximum quantity of propane stored would be 188,700-pounds.
