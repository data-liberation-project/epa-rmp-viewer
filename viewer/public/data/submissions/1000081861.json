In pursuit of our corporate policy, the Saegertown facility has performed a Risk Management Review for the listed chemicals onsite and developed individualized risk reduction plans for the following:\n\nA\u00b7 Bromine - improved passive mitigation to prevent offsite consequences.\nB\u00b7 Toluene Diisocyanate - converted from bulk storage tank to drum storage so that no reasonable release scenario exceeds threshold quantity so that only general duty compliance is required.\nC\u00b7 Hydrochloric Acid - uses from purchase through disposal do not exceed the compliance \nconcentration of 37 percent.   \n\nOur commitment to protect our employees and the public from accidental releases includes safety reviews, alarms, emergency training, active mitigation, and passive mitigation.  Facility emergency response teams are available to respond to an emergency release.  Equipment available to team members includes cell phones, hand held radios and laptop computers.  Personal protective equipment available includes chemical resistant suits and supplied air respirators. \n\nAccess to the site is restricted (24 hour site security) to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and a limited number of contractors.  Bromine is the only substance handled at this facility that exceeds the threshold quantity of covered substances regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule. The maximum amount of bromine that can be stored at this facility is 26,000 lbs, which is contained in one limited access bulk storage tank.\n\nThe Saegertown facility handles bromine, which is considered hazardous by EPA.

Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle bromine combined with (1) the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, (2) the safe handling procedures that we use, and (3) the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the requirements in OSHA's Employee Emergency Plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and Hazardous Waste and Emergency Operations (HAZWOPER) regulation (29 CFR 1910.120).  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders, County and State agencies and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nAn up-to date Off-Site Emergency Response Plan for Parker Lord Corporation - Saegertown, PA Operations is maintained with the Crawford County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) Director and is an integral part of the Environmental Emergency Response Plans for the Lord Saegertown Operations (which is also maintained by the Crawford county OEM, PADEP-Meadville Office, and the Saegertown Volunteer Fire Department).\n\nThe Emergency Response Plans have been reviewed and coordinated with the Crawford County \nOEM and the Saegertown VFD.

The products we manufacture are essentially mixtures comprised of solvents, water, chemical intermediates, and other chemical materials.  \n\nThese products are used by heavy industry to bond rubber elastomers to metal supports and frames to produce automobile engine mounts, transmission seals, energy absorbing bumper subassemblies and other applications including shock and vibration control uses.  We also manufacture industrial adhesives which are used by industry in the manufacture of laminated roll goods and structural adhesives for many manufacturing oriented applications.  Additionally, Parker-Lord Saegertown manufactures a line of urethane coatings which provide corrosion resistant painted surfaces for heavy industrial use.\n\nBromine is one of the reactants required to manufacture two intermediate products which are eventually blended with other materials to produce several of our products.  \nThe processes covered by this RMP include Brominated Intermediate #1 Manufacturing.  \n\nBrominated Intermediate #1 Manufacturing Processes\nThe Saegertown plant has handled bromine safely for more than 30 years.  A detailed \nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA), covering all known equipment and the process associated with bromine handling, was initially conducted in 1992.  The PHA programs for this process is reviewed every three years and the management of this process is on-going.  \n\nThe process uses glass lined steel reactor vessel which is jacketed to enable cooling and heating via circulated jacket water.  The jacket water is either heated by steam or cooled by city water through a heat exchanger.  \n\nBromine is delivered to Parker-Lord in a special tank truck consisting of two separate 600 gallon tanks mounted on a trailer frame.

All bromine bulk storage is located within concrete diked areas that are enclosed and continuously monitored for bromine vapors (continuous air monitoring systems are in place for the bulk storage and processing area.  The storage facility is equipped with a water deluge system and ammonia gas delivery system to neutralize vapors.  The concrete containment dikes maintain a layer of water (or water blanket) which, should a release of bromine enter the dike, the water will suppress any bromine vapors thus providing passive mitigation.  The bromine handling system (bulk tank, receiver and reactor) is vented to a scrubber to prevent atmospheric discharges.  Water fog nozzles are located at the tank truck unloading containment area for additional active mitigation and suppression of vapors.\n \nLiquid bromine is transferred from the 1000 gallon bulk storage tank by nitrogen pressurization into receiver vessels.  The bromine is mixed with other reactants in the reactor to produce a processing intermediate.  In case of overpressurization, the receivers are vented to concrete dike areas where containment and passive mitigation control (water blanketing) are present.  The liquid bromine is then transferred from the receiver vessel to a reactor by gravity through approved piping.  The reactor is equipped with pressure relief venting.  Pressure is preceded by alarms.  Should a rupture disc (pressure relief) open as designed to relieve pressure, the process would vent into a concrete diked area where containment and passive mitigation control (water blanketing) is present.  \n\n3.
