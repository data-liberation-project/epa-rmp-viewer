Anhydrous Ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental protection Agency and the same properties that make anhydrous ammonia valuable refrigerant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions. To prevent exposure to our workers, surrounding community and the environment, it is our policy to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program by: Managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state regulation. A copy of our Emergency Response Plan has been forwarded to the Local Fire Department and Local Emergency Response Commission, informing the community of the potential hazards and minimizing the risk of an accidental release. Our plant personnel have been trained in the equipment operating procedures and various safety devices, which are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of an accidental release. Key employees have been trained to isolate all areas of the refrigeration system which may become hazardous. These employees have attended 24 hour emergency response training course in ammonia refrigeration and have attended each year afterwards the eight (8) hour refresher training. Safety depends on the proper handling of Anhydrous Ammonia in this facility and American Seafood\u00bfs will ensure that the safety of its employee and the community comes first along with the safe operation of our ammonia system.  \n\nThe following engineering controls are in place at American Seafood\u00bfs international LLC., These controls are designed to reduce the possibility of an accidental release. Electronic Ammonia Detection Systems have been installed in the refrigeration room and other areas within the facility. Visual and audible alar"

      "SummaryText": "ms regarding activation were installed in the plant to alert personnel of an ammonia leak. High and Low level switches will shut down the associated compressor operations depending on the circumstance. All compressors are configured with critical safety controls which will shut down the compressor in the event of an abnormal operating condition.  Safety relief valves have been installed on all pressure vessels, condensers, compressors to eliminate over pressurized conditions. A complete drawing of the refrigeration system is on file with the local Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Commission. These drawings show an in depth outline of our system with locations and descriptions of all critical valves, in regards to safety relief, solenoid and isolation.  With the help of these drawings and tagged isolation valves, responders are aware of what valves to close. Recently updated areas allow the responders to shut down areas from remote locations without the risk of exposure to ammonia. A periodic maintenance program is in place at American Seafood\u00bfs to ensure the refrigeration system and its components are kept in optimal mechanical and operating status.\n\nAmerican Seafood Maintenance Management checks the refrigeration system on weekends for any signs of malfunction. In out five year (as of 1/16/2001) history American Seafood\u00bfs has had no reportable accidents. Our last reports accident was on 1/8/2001 and was listed as case # 552906.  The incident was handled by our emergency response personnel who included the following steps and will use as a future guideline.\n\nEvacuation of Employees and evaluate the situation.  Once it is determined to be an emergency situation, place calls to Local Fire Department and LEPC. Company personnel trained in responding will put on Level 1 suits if necessary or isolate area from a remote location.  Response personnel are aware of all controls in regards to these procedures and can minimize the amount of a release in a quick and"
