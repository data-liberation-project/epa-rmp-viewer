Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the storage tanks to the processing system or loading stations occur inside fixed steel pipes and are controlled manually.\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \u00bfevents\u00bf are very short in duration \u00bf a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank, as indicated by the worst-case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tanks were built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input. The passive mitigation systems in place at the Waterloo facility are:\n\u00bf  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tanks. If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the steel structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.

      "SummaryText": "ty are:\n\u00bf  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won\u00bft reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\u00bf  Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia or propane from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tanks.\n\u00bf  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n\u00bf  An emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the tank shuts the valve off.\n\u00bf  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a 15,000 gallon tank nearby and three water well hookups; one at the loading station and two nearby.\n\u00bf  Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n\u00bf  Operator and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\nPrevention Program\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility\u00bfs hazard management program.  All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the production season.

      "SummaryText": "Waterloo Wholesale & Retail RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Waterloo Wholesale & Retail Fertilizer facility is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular). This facility has been operated by The Andersons, Inc. since the fall of 1998. The facility manager is Terry Bechman.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately 11 acres and is situated 3 miles east of the town of Waterloo and southwest of the intersection of Hwy 6 and CR 47.  The facility is adjacent to the Dekalb-Agra Grain Elevator on the west side of the property.  There is one neighbor to the west, about a \u00bc mile.  There is one residence across the road to the south and one directly across the road to the east.  The nearest residence to the north is \u00bc mile.\n\nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  One 26,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 22,100 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.  Anydrous ammonia has a strong chemical affinity for water and therefore, an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-scale release.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as indicated by the alternative release scenario. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck) to the bulk storage tank or a transfer from the loading statio"
