THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nJones Dairy Farm utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in closed system refrigeration systems.  There are two separate closed loop ammonia refrigeration systems on the site (\"West\" and \"East\" systems).  Jones Dairy Farm is committed to protecting its employees, the public and the environment from potential releases of ammonia.  Jones Dairy Farm has given utmost consideration to safety in the design and operation of the refrigeration system.  We have conducted formal Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and \"What-if/Checklist\" studies of the \"East\" refrigeration system as well as a \"What-if/Checklist\" review of the \"West\" refrigeration system and spent several million dollars in the process of creating the new \"West\" refrigeration system while improving and upgrading the existing \"East\" ammonia refrigeration system.  As a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Jones Dairy Farm is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of Jones Dairy Farm`s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, Jones Dairy Farm is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made"

      "SummaryText": " during the Process Hazards Analysis and in consideration of the Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\nJones Dairy Farm refrigeration system maintenance and operations personnel receive ongoing training on the safe operation of the system.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are also conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\n\n\nJones Dairy Farm has a dedicated emergency response team to handle emergencies involving ammonia.  The team is equipped with special \"Level A\" protection and is specially trained to detect, isolate and mitigate potential releases.  The emergency plan has been coordinated with the Jefferson County Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nJones Dairy Farm is a meat processor.  We cook, cure, smoke, and package pre-processed meats.  We use a refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing in processing areas of the plant.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia, which is the RMP regulated substance.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the combined systems is approximately 94,000 pounds.  The estimated maximum quantity listed in the RMPlan was originally 45,000 pounds; however, the system was modified in 2007 to add an second (and independent) refrigeration system now identified as the \"West System\" (to be differentiated from the original system now known as the \"East System\").  Simultaneously, the \"East System\" ammonia inventory estimate was revised [up] after a more detailed inventory analysis was performed by an independent [ammonia refrigeration] contractor.\n\n\n\nIn the refrigeration systems, the liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators and heat exchangers where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems are closed loop two stage industrial refrigeration systems. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other "

THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule (29 CFR 1910.119) and the USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule (40 CFR 68).  The entire ammonia system has been designed and installed according to guidelines provided by the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  The ammonia refrigeration system is operated and maintained by trained and experienced operators.\n\n\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm.   For the \"West\" refrigeration plant, the results are mitigated by the fact that all the major vessels and the much of the piping are inside the Jones Dairy facility. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTATIVE STEPS: \n\n\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place. These include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nSafework Practices\n\nEmployee and Operator Training Programs\n\nMechanical Integrity Program\n\nManagement of Change Procedures\n\nPSM Compliance Audit Procedures\n\nIncident Investigation Procedures\n\nEmployee Participation Program\n\nHot Work Permit Procedures\n\nContractor Safety Program\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAmmonia specific prevention steps include:\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls\n\nOperator Training\n\nComputerized controls\n\n"

Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\n\n\n5.  THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nJones Dairy Farm experienced one leak of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system in 2011.  For further details on this release, please see Section 6 (Accident History) as sited earlier in this document.\n\n\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Jones Dairy Farm emergency response program is based on and is in compliance with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation, 29 CFR 1910.120.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  We have discussed this program with the local fire department.  The Emergency Response Program is written and it includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nJones Dairy Farm is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows Jones Dairy Farm to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of Jones Dairy Farm employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized s"

The basic information used to create the original worst case scenario was not available and the information could not be verified.  The information used in the 2013 meets expectations and allowances by the EPA for a worst case scenario.  The alternative release scenario was also revised.  The new alternative release assumes a more likely scenario (discharge from the largest relief valve) and also reflects more closely the allowances and expectations of an alternative release scenario as allowed by the EPA.\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n\n\n04/11/2018 - This update/revision of the RMPlan also included:\n\n     - changed the LAT/LONG (previous point was appx 1000 from compressor room)\n\n     - changed method for determining LAT/LONG\n\n"
