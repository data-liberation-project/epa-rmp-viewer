Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at United Farmers Co-op in Lafayette are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Lafayette Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 30,000- and one 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Lafayette (Figure 1). The maximum amount stored is 80,600 gallons (352,552 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%  including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at 85% maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nUnited Farmers Co-op maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with "
