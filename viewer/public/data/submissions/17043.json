Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response\n policies \n\nWe at Soldier Canyon Filter Plant are committed to employee, \npublic and environmental safety.  This commitment is \ndemonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention \nprogram that covers areas such as operating procedures, \nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes \nat our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate \ncontrols to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly \ntrained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and \nmitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely \ncoordinated with Poudre Valley Fire Authority which provides \nadditional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility which\nis Chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 12000\nlbs.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative \nRelease Scenario, including administrative controls \nand mitigation measures to limit the distances for each \nreported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis \nfor our facility, we have used the look-up tables and \nequations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite \nConsequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs \nprovide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-Case Analysis\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from\nthe Chlorine room.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb.\nof Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The Release rate \n(lbs/min) is calculated to be 200. A distance to endpoint of \n5.4 miles is obtained which affects  a residential population \nof 21078 within this distance.\n\n\nToxic Alternative-Case Analysis\n\nThe Alternative Case scenario involves a release from the Chlorine \nroom.
