The hazardous Communication Program has been incorporated into the Risk Management Program to help evaluate the needs of our facility.  informational training sessions with employees on response to an emergency has prepared them to respond in a safe manner.  Our facility is a wastewater treatment plant and the wastewater is chlorinated for disinfection.  One ton cylinders of chlorine are used in this process and there are usually 1 to 1.5 cylinders on site.  The regulators are cleaned and inspected every six months for compentency.  There has never been any chlorine release that could not be routinely handled.  The employees at the treatment facility have been trained to respond to leaks and are knowledgable of the emergency agencies to notify if a leak cannot be contained immediatly.  Environmental Management Corporation and the City of Seymour will continue to monitor the chlorine process and take all neccessary measures to prevent any accidental release."
