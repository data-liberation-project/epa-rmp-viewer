Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the chlorine system.\n\nWhite Lily's policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities in accordance with the most current building and safety codes. This ensures the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.\n\nWhite Lily is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures. New employees are provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility. In addition, White Lily conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year. Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nIn June 1998, White Lily had a release of chlorine that affected an employee. A small amount of chlorine was trapped in a line and released when a valve was opened. The employee became ill and was treated at a hospital. After the review of the incident, operating procedures were modified to prevent further occurrences.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWhite Lily does not have emergency response capability at this facility. White Lily monitors the alarm system 24 hours a day and notifies the local HazMat team (911) in the event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWhite Lily and American Ingredients, Inc. completes a thorough review of the chlorine systems each time a design change is implemented. The system is also evaluated each time the PHA is revised. White Lily is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is the policy of the White Lily Foods Company, Inc. (White Lily), Knoxville, Tennessee, facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to White Lily employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nWhite Lily management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe White Lily facility utilizes flourmills to produce flour. The raw materials used in the processes are wheat and chlorine gas. Support operations include a grain elevator system, a quality assurance/control laboratory, and administrative offices. Figure 1-1 shows the site location. Figure 1-2 shows the site plan.\n\nOne chemical, chlorine, is utilized at the facility, in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP. The chlorine is used to bleach or age the flour.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nChlorine\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a chlorine release included a release of all the contents of one of the 2,000-pound chlorine cylinders in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines). This translates to a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes or 200 pounds/min. Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are:  the chlorine is a liquefied gas; the cylinder is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is c"

      "SummaryText": "haracterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec, and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable). The results of the worst-case assessment for chlorine show that the plume must travel 3.23 miles before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 3.0 parts per million (ppm). Figure 1-3 shows the worst-case release radius.\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the chlorine system is a release resulting from a flour plug on the inlet side of the flour agitator. The plug prevents flour from entering the agitator, which results in the loss of the flour seal on the discharge side of the agitator. The chlorine is released on the second floor of the mill building as a vapor. The release rate is a maximum of 18.75 lb/hour (0.3125 lb/min).\n\nThe release radius is calculated using the log-log equation for urban conditions.\n\nD = 0.878 (QR)0.5134\n\nD = Distance in miles\nQR = Release rate in lb/min\n\nTherefore:\n\nD = 0.878 (0.3125)0.5134\n    = 0.48 miles\n\nThe distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l is 0.48 miles. Figure 1-4 shows the alternate case release scenario radius.\n\nNo active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place. The meteorological data used for this alternative release scenario was a wind speed of 3 meter/sec, an atmospheric stability classification of D (neutral stability), and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Knoxville facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public, and to the environment. These regulations include:\n\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\nThe key concepts in White Lily's release"
