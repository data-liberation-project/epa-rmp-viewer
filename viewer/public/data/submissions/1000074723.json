The property is bounded on three sides by Metro East Industries.  The site runoff water and any possible spill on the site into the site sewer system empty into a 100,000 gallon waste water pit.  The material collected in this pit is analyzed for pH prior being pumped to the local POTW.\n\n\n\nThe Alorton Plant is required to comply with the Solvay Process Hazard Management Program.  This program meets or exceeds the minimum requirements as listed in 29CFR1910.119 OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard for the same regulated substance - Hydrogen Fluoride and Ammonia - that are also covered by the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112 A; or as more commonly referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program.\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nSolvay Fluorides, LLC., is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.   This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement controls to prevent possible release of regulated substances.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the safe design of the plant.  Automatic and manual means of water mitigation are available throughout the process area to reduce the potential effects of accidental release\n\n\n\n2.
