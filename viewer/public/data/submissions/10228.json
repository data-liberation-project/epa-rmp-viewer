The Wasco facility serves as a normally unmanned bulk petroleum and propane terminal with additional \"card-lock\" fuel access to fleet customers.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case is assumed to be the release of the entire contents of a 10,000 gallon water capacity propane tank, which when filled to a maximum level of 88% as an administrative control, would involve a total quantity of 36,460 pounds of liquified propane which can possibly be released.  The released propane is assumed to form a vapor cloud and only 10% of the vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in an explosion.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative release scenario is considered to be a propane truck pulling away from the loading rack while still connected, and the released propane causing a vapor cloud fire.  This scenario was identified in the hazard analysis as being more likely than the worst case, it could reach an endpoint offsite, and is one of the applicable alternative release scenarios listed in the regulations.  The excess flow valve on the propane storage tank is assumed to function to stop the release and limit the released quantity of propane to only 69 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nWholesale Fuels, Inc. has integrated the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) Prevention Program 2 elements within a comprehensive environmental management system, incorporating all applicable emergency response, planning, and prevention requirements under the \"One Plan\" format.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWholesale Fuels, Inc. has not had an accidental release of propane during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nWholesale"

The berm around the aboveground petroleum storage tanks on site will be reinforced or rebuilt as necessary to ensure its ability to retain any spilled petroleum products from pooling and possibly being ignited under the propane storage tanks.  All propane piping at the Wasco faciltiy will be uniformly painted to ensure additional corrosion protection.  The \"No smoking - Shut off engine\" signs will be replaced and maintained as necessary at the \"card-lock\" customer fueling island.  All planned changes will be completed within the ensuing 36 months and an internal facility compliance audit will ensure that this is accomplished."
