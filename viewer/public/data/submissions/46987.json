      "SummaryText": "The Mayde Creek Municipal Utility District owns and operates a municipal wastewater treatment plant in the Mayde Creek area.  This wastewater treatment plant is responsible for the treatment of the sanitary waste from several surrounding subdivisions, households and small local businesses.  Mayde Creek MUD contracts the operation of this wastewater treatment plant to Environmental Development Partners (EDP).  Both Mayde Creek MUD and Environmental Development Partners are committed to the safe operation of the wastewater treatment plant.  The wastewater plant utilizes two substances that are listed on the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) hazardous substances list.  These two substances are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The chlorine is stored in individual one ton cylinders, and no more than two are ever stored on site at one time.  The chlorine is used to disinfect the wastewater prior to release from the treatment plant.  Sulfur dioxide is stored in 150 pound cylinders and no more than ten are stored on site at one time.  The sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the water prior to release from the treatment plant.  As a part of the Risk Management Plan, both worst case and alternative release scenarios were modeled using an EPA developed and approved dispersion modeling program.  The worst case release scenarios are complete loss of inventory in a ten minute period. The consequences of such a release would result in offsite impacts of chlorine of 1.3 miles (Urban) from the facility.  Several households, a school and Cullen Park would be impacted.  The worst case release scenario of sulfur dioxide would result in a 0.3 mile impact from the facility.  Several households could be affected.  Both these scenarios result in minimal offsite consequences and could affect only a few households close to the facility.  Regardless of the type of release, the treatment plant is equipped with monitors to detect both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  These monitors sound loc"
