CONCORDIA, MO, this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system.\n\nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Deli, Inc. CONCORDIA, MO., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n     \nAT CONCORDIA, MO WE USE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR OUR REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n        \n3.  Worst-Case Scenario  \n\nThe Tyson Deli facility has a vertical ammonia high pressure receiver and a Horizontal as largest ammonia vessels.  The liquid-full capacity of the horizontal recirculator is 605.80 cubic feet.  Using the ammonia condensing temperature of 12 degrees yields an approximate operating pressure of 26 psig and an ammonia liquid density of 40.79 pounds per cubic foot.  The calculation of 605.80 cubic feet multiplied by the liquid density yields the ammonia capacity of 19,772.84 pounds.  Using RMP Comp with the settings of ammonia liquefied under pressure, rural Topography and no passive mitigation the distance to endpoint is 2.6 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario  \n\nTyson Foods has chosen the alternative release scenario of a pressure relief valve activation.  Pressure relief valve activations historically have been the primary release type within the company based on reports to Environmental Compliance.  The scenario chosen was based on a standard for the com"

The Hansen 5613 SRV is located on the high-pressure receiver.  The valve has an inlet port size of 1\" and an outlet port size of 1-1/4\" and discharge flow rating of 85.4 pounds per minute (air rating) at a pressure setting of 250 psig.  The actual release rate would be less for ammonia depending on specific conditions at the time of release.  The typical release duration may not reach the property boundaries of most Tyson facilities, though EPA requires the alternative release scenarios to reach the boundary.  Tyson chose the release duration of 5 minutes in a rural setting to yield a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n     \n This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators augmented by Tyson Standards and Specifications for design, construction and maintenance of refrigeration systems.\n \n5.  Five-year accident history.  No recordable accidents under the EPA RMP 5 year accident reporting criteria.\n                 \n6.   The emergency response program.\n\nA written Action Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures using fixed systems at the plan"

Tyson employees will not respond to emergency incidents involving ammonia above immediately dangerous to life and health concentrations (IDLH) due to limitations in training and equipment maintained on-site.  The facility relies on defensive action support from the local Fire Department who would assist with evacuations and vapor suppression if necessary.  If deemed necessary, the local fire department would make contact with the Local Emergency Planning Commission to request Regional Hazardous Materials Team support for a Technician Level hazardous materials response.  The first resources likely to respond under the regional program would be the Lafayette County Hazard Response Team.  Protocols are in place to request this resource if needed and a teaming agreement is in place between Tyson Deli, Inc. and the emergency services entities involved.  Site visits and tours are routinely planned with local emergency responders.\n\nAll Team members are trained in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or a member of management immediately.  Supervisors are taught to report the above to the Safety or Maintenance department immediately for further investigation and action by the Refrigeration Team.  SDS information is accessible to all team members for review.\n     \n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n     \nThe Concordia, MO facility will continue to implement Process Safety Management policies, procedures and preventive maintenance as needed to comply with State and Federal regulations."
