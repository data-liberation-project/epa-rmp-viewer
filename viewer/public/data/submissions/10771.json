Gas plant personnel periodically\nmonitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Laverne gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a\nchange in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features,\nprocedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the\nequipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in\naccordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The\nPSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

      "SummaryText": "LAVERNE GAS PLANT\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Continental Natural Gas Laverne plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public\nsafety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as\ntraining personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of\nour processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to\ncontrol and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Laverne gas plant, located in Laverne, Oklahoma, operates a variety of processes to produce\npetroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from natural gas. The Laverne\ngas plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. There are no regulated toxic\nsubstances at the Laverne facility.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level\n3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the\nlargest storage tank containing butane. A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory\nto 257,600 lb, (90% of the maximum tank capacity); therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to\nrelease and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1psi endpoint for this WCS is\n0.51 miles. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their\nconsequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this\nWCS.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substance's At the Laverne gas plant is a VCE\nresulting from the release of propane from a product loading pump.

This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in\nemergency planning and response. Figure 1-1 graphically presents the hazard assessment results for\nthe flammable WCS and ARS events.\n\fGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Laverne plant. Because\nprocesses at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk\nmanagement program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration's (OSHA's)  process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each\nof the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident\nprevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Laverne gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management\nand accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling\ntechnical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard\nanalysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant\naccident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention\nprogram are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and\naddresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of\ninitiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives\ninclude forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have\nmembers from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant\nmanagement.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Laverne gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes.

This team identifies and evaluates\nhazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes\nsuggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such\nmeasures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking\nassigned by  the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the\nhighest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team\nfindings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and\nretained. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the\nhazard analysis results.\n\nThese periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency\nuntil the  process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented\nand retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the\nfinal resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Laverne gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\noperations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency\nshutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be\nused as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new\noperators. These procedures are periodically  reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\nThe procedu"

Specific departments within the gas plant are  assigned responsibility\nfor maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table  summarizing the reference documents\nand their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help\nemployees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). The gas plant ensures\nthat the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring\ninstruments, highly trained personnel,  and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown\nsystems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design\nand construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination\nwith written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and\nmaintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that\nsafety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n The Laverne gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the\nvarious processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically\nexamined to  identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Laverne gas plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to\nperform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough\nhazard evaluation"

In addition, the Laverne plant maintains written\noperating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other\npersonnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Laverne gas plant has implemented\na  comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees\nreceive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.\nAfter successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn\nprocess-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills\ndemonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own,\nthey can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the\noperating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\nThis refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for\neach operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Laverne gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased\nmaintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment,\nthe gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe\nmanner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their\nworkplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and\nfollow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their\nwork.
