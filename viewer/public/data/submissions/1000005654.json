The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) performing tests, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (4) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Certified contractors will be used for vessel inspection and pressure relief valve testing.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, and (4) emergency response plans to help ensure that work is performed in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help to ensure that equipment function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing   the equipment back in service (if possible), or an engineer will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that prope"

The Cordona Lake Gas Plant is an existing facility but no receptors are present within the distance to the worst-case release endpoint.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\n\r\nHazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe hazard analysis is conducted by a company engineer with maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise of this type of facility.

XTO Energy demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable goals to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nPRCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant, located near Crane, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas.  Regulated flammables such as propane and butane are present but no regulated toxic substances are present at Cordona Lake.  The facility is a refrigeration unit using compressed propane to cool the incoming gas stream.  This liberates natural gas liquids which are separated in the three phase separator then stabilized in a tower using the glycol still as a heat source.  The stabilized liquids are stored and trucked to delivery.  The glycol is also used to inhibit freezing by injecting it into the inlet stream. The glycol is recovered in the three-phase separator and sent to the still to regenerate.  The gas off the three phase separator is cross exchanged with the inlet then sent to sales.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the Cordona Lake Gas Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 29,000 gallons (140,000 lbs.).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.30 miles.  Although numerous controls are in place to p"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence and forward these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Cordona Lake Gas Plant conducts an audit every 3 years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit staff members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to North Lansing Liquid management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Cordona Lake Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release and to reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\n       Release Containment Control\r\n\r\n       1) Valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n       2)  Automated bypasses and manual shutoffs for specific process parameters\r\n       3)  Pressure relief valves will be properly d and testes every 3 years.  Any such valve that fails a test will be replaced or   \r\n       repaired and tested annually until engineering is satisfied that it's reliable.\r\n       4)  Baseline ultrasonic testing thickness testing (for pipe corrosion) will be performed prior to startup and every 3 years\r\n       there after.\r\n\r\n       Release Mitigation\r\n\r\n       1)  Local fire department has been notified about the potential hazards of the new facility and has been given the emergency \r\n       response plan.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant has not had any accidents within the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.
