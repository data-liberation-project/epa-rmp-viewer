      "SummaryText": "The City of Claremore operates a Waste Water Treatment Plant (Facility) located at 1500 S Choctaw Street in Claremore, Oklahoma. The Facility treats Claremore's residential and industrial waste waters before discharge to Dog Creek. The Facility uses one (1) regulated substance (chlorine) above the threshold quantity of the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68). The goal of this Risk Management Program is to prevent an accidental release of chlorine that could potentially cause harm to the public and/or the environment, and to mitigate the severity of any release that does occur.  The Risk Management Program includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.                                                                                                        The Facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.                                                                                                                                      In the event of an emergency involving the chlorine system, the Facility's emergency action plan requires an immediate evacuation of the Facility and immediate notification of the Claremore Fire Depatment and members of the Claremore Fire Department have inspected the Facility. The Claremore Fire Department has the necessary equipment required to seal a leak in a chlorine 1 ton container.  They are also equipped with self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) that would enable them to enter the Chlorine Room and work to mitigate a chlorine release.

      "SummaryText": "orine stored at the Facility is 10,000 pounds contained in five (5) 1 ton cylinders, associated piping, valves and other equipment.  The chlorine equuipment is housed in a building.  However, the ton cylinders are delivered by truck and are offloaded outside of the Chlorine Room.  The worst case release scenario for chlorine would be an accident during offloading resulting in the rupture of one 1 ton cylinder and the release of its entire contents over a ten (10) minute period.   A more realistic release scenario known as the alternative-case release scenario was identified in a process hazard analysis (PHA) of the Facility's chlorine system. This release would be much smaller than the worst-case release, and it was estimated that it could be contained within one (1) hour by the Claremore Fire Department.  This release could occur if an operator failed to properly attach the regulator to the chlorine ton cylinder valve, and then opened the valve.  This would cause a release of chlorine through the open valve at an estimated rate of 15 lb/min."
