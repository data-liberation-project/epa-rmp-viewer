Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Krien Farm Supply, L.L.C. in McDonald are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Atwood Dispatch Office, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in two 12,000-gallon interconnected tanks at our facility in McDonald (Figure 1). \nThe maximum amount stored is 20,400 gallons (104,978 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of\n85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected anhydrous ammonia storage tank (104,978 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\nperiod.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum\ndistance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.6 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated pop"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 4.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nKrien Farm Supply, L.L.C. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nKrien Farm Supply, L.L.C. maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within\nour covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation;\nthe information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nKrien Farm Supply, L.L.C. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\nwho are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\nprocesses.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nKrien Farm Supply, L.L.C. conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\nensure proper operation.
