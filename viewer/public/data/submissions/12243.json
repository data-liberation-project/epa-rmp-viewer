      "SummaryText": "APPLICABILITY\n     The Sioux City Water Treatment Plant in Sioux City, IA uses chlorine for disinfection as part of its process to provide quality drinking water to its citizens.   Chlorine is purchased in ton cylinders and stored in a special Chemical Feed Building outside the main Water Treatment Plant.  At any time, there could be as many as 6 chlorine ton cylinders in the storage room.  The building contains local and remote warnings and will automatically close all vests if there is a chlorine leak.  It is the intent of the City of Sioux City to investigate reducing the inventory at the plant.  Fewer ton cylinders in place at any one time will not only provide a more safe environment, but also lend itself to the just in time philosophy of good business practices.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n     The City of Sioux City accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and is in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program requirements.\n\n     Chemical-specific prevention steps include awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, presence of chlorine detectors and a chlorine room that will lock-up if there is a chlorine leak.  Also the Sioux City Fire Department HazMat team is available in five minutes or less.\n\n     Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for chlorine is available in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.1200.  The current maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 8,000 lb. stored in four one-ton cylinders, and two one-ton cylinders connected to the chlorination system.  It is the intent of the City of Sioux City to minimize this amount by January 1, 2000.\n     \n      Operation temperature is always atmospheric.  Control of the chlorination process is by flow proportional and residual chlorine feed pacing.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor and record the treated water residuals.\n \n     Equipment specific"

The findings will be review will all affected personnel whose job tasks are affected by the findings.  Investigation summaries will be retained for five years.\n\n     The City of Sioux City Water Treatment Plant emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to our local plant, and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in combine with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  The Water Plant is NOT a first responder as there are too few workers to run an appropriate program.  The local fire department HAZMAT responds to chlorine accidental releases.  However, an emergency response plan is maintained at the stationary source for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment and contains procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases in compliance with the local HAZMAT guidelines.  The local fire department is a member of the Woodbury County Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC), and has been involved in developing a community emergency response plan.  The Plant will evacuate and call 911 for HAZMAT in an emergency chlorine release.\n  \nGENERAL INFORMATION\n      \nAll these elements are in place at the Water Plant in at least a rudimentary form.  It is the intent of the City of Sioux City to again review these policies and make the necessary improvements in the next six months, which will be by January 1, 2000.\n\n\nTOPOGRAPHY\n   The topography type selected for input into the scenario analysis was urban (terrain with many obstructions).  A review of USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle maps of the area shows the water treatment plant is located in the Missouri River valley.  A line of bluffs rising 199 plus feet above the valley form a semicircle around the plant from Northwest to the northeast.  A series of buildings lie immediately west of th"

The compliance audit will be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  A report will be prepared of the audit findings.  An appropriate response to each of the findings of the compliance audit will be promptly determined and documented listing any deficiencies that have been corrected.  The Plant will retain the two most recent compliance audit reports within the prior five-year period.\n\nThe City of Sioux City Water Treatment Plant will investigate each incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release.  An incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  A summary will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation including:  date of incident, date investigation began, a description of the incident, the factors that contributed to the incident, and any recommendations resulting from the investigation.

The Missouri River is approximately 1,000 feet south of the treatment plant and the South Sioux City, Nebraska metropolitan area is approximately 2,000 feet south-southeast.\n\nMETEROLOGICAL CONDITIONS FOR WORST-CASE SENARIO\n   The meteorological conditions for the worst-case are specified in the RMP regulations as follows:\n          Wind Speed:           1.5 meters/second (3.4 miles/hr)\n          Stability Class:        F (very stable conditions)\n          Air Temperature:    25 degrees C (77 degrees F)\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE ANALYSIS\n     The regulations define the worst case release as a catastrophic release in which the total content of the single largest vessel onsite is released to the environment.  All of the chlorine storage vessels at the Water Treatment Plant are one ton cylinders.  For this analysis, the cylinder was assumed to be outdoors when the release occurs.  \n\n     For toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient pressure, the regulations stipulate the release time frame must be 10 minutes for the worst-case scenario.\n\n     The toxic endpoint for chlorine is established by the regulation to be 0.0087 mg/L.  The endpoint analysis was completed using RMP*Comp software developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  At a release rate of 200 pounds per minute for 10 minutes directly to the environment, the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is calculated to read a radius of approximately 2.1 kilometers (1.3 miles) around the WaterTreatment Plant.\n\n     The offsite receptors were determined as follows:\nResidential Population:  Siouxland Interstate Metropolitan Planning Council (SIMPCO) using the U.S. census Bureau LANDVIEW III mapping program.

Chlorine is withdrawn from the regulator via a vacuum and is routed to the chlorine injector through approximately 20 feet of 5/8 plastic tubing.  If a break occurs at any location within the plastic tubing, the vacuum is lost and all chlorine flow stops.  If a break occurs before the regulator, chlorine will escape until mitigation measures can be applied by emergency responders.  Based upon the hazard review conducted by facility personnel, the most likely release scenario resulting in offsite consequences would be a break in the cylinder valve.\n\n     The alternative release scenario assumes the release occurs within the chlorine storage building and that all doors are closed prior to and during the release.  The release occurs from the valve located at the top of the cylinder, therefore, only chlorine in the gaseous phase is released.  It is assumed the valve partially fails, creating a breach of up to 0.0276 square inches.  The release rate for chlorine vapor can be calculated by the following equation provided in the EPA Offsite Consequence Guidance Manual:\n\n      QR = (190)Ah       where:  QR = release rate (pounds/minute)\n                                                     190 = chemical-specific factor for chlorine at a tank pressure of 113 psi\n                                                       Ah = hole area (square inches)\n\n     Solving:    QR = (190) (0.0276) = 5.244 pounds per minute\n\n     The chlorine storage building is equipped with a chlorine alarm system which will alert plant"
