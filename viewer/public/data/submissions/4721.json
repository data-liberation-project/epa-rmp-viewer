      "SummaryText": "IVE SUMMARY|RMP.TXT|Executive Summary_________________________________________________\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the turn of this century, water-borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States.  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine's introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.  \n\nThe use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n\nCooper City Utilities has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.  Cooper City Utilities' track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, Cooper City Utiliti"

Since the largest container stored at the facility holds 2,000 pounds of chlorine, the worst case release scenario is a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over 10 minutes.  This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3ppm.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary_________________________________________________\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the turn of this century, water-borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States.  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine's introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.  \n\nThe use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n\nCooper City Utilities has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.  Cooper City Utilities' track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, Cooper City Utilities has taken a compr"
