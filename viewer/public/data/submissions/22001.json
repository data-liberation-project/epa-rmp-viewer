Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nConstructed in 1991, the Columbia Energy Group (Columbia Propane) Sinking Springs Facility provides a vital energy service that supplies homeowners, commercial businesses, and industry.  The facility has an excellent safety record, and its employees are key players in achieving that safety record.\n\nColumbia Propane is committed to safe and reliable operation for the protection of its employees, the community, and the environment.  Columbia is proud of its nine year operating record, during which there has never been an incident that resulted in any off-site impacts to neighboring industries, residents or the community at large. This record has been achieved through consistent attention by the staff to safe operating practices and preventive maintenance.  Columbia monitors and works with personnel of transport drivers to ensure incident-free product loading.  These practices form the backbone of Columbia Propane's dedication to keeping the facility and its community safe.\n\n\n2. Description of the source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Columbia Propane facility in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, receives deliveries of liquid propane from the TEPPCO product pipeline.  The plant holds the product in pressurized storage tanks for delivery to its customers by truck.  Ethyl mercaptan, an odorizing agent, is added to the LPG being distributed from the terminal.  Both propane and ethyl mercaptan are regulated flammable substances.  The terminal has no RMP listed toxic chemicals in threshold quantities.\n\n\n3. Hazard Assessment\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) rule requires companies to develop release scenarios that estimate the potential community impact from an accidental release. These scenarios are intended to be useful for emergency planning in the event of an accident. The EPA requires two types of scenario. The worst-case"

      "SummaryText": "scenario is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance. It assumes meteorological conditions that would result in the greatest impact. The alternative release scenario allows industries to develop a more realistic scenario for emergency planning.\n\nThe worst case scenario at the Columbia Propane terminal is a large release of propane that would have off-site effects. The alternative release scenario is a limited release of propane from a hose failure that would have off-site effects. The release prevention program described in Section 4 is designed to minimize the chance of an accidental release.\n\n\n4. Release Prevention Program\n\nThe terminal was designed and built in accordance with provisions of NFPA 58, Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code (National Fire Protection Association), the nationally recognized standard for LPG facilities.\n\nThe product storage area of the plant is monitored by fire detectors and combustible vapor detectors.  Activation of any of these detectors provides automatic shutdown of truck loading and also notifies the plant manager and the local fire department.\n\nActivities at the terminal are conducted in accordance with operating and maintenance procedures, which were written to insure that receipt and delivery of product is conducted safely.\n\nSafe work permits are ensured to insure safety during such activities as hot work, electrical work, confined space and vessel entry.\n\nOnly authorized personnel are allowed inside the plant without an escort.  Transport drivers who are still in their training period are accompanied.\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the five-year reporting period, there has been no release of propane or ethyl mercaptan that resulted in injuries, deaths, property damage, evacuations, sheltering in place, or environmental damage either on site or off-site.\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nResponse actions have been coordinated with the West Wyomissing Fire Department.  Department personnel make regular visits to"
