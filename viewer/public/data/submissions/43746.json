The plant began operation in April, 1985.  A series of expansion projects involving the main refrigeration system were completed during the late 1980s and 1990s.  The last expansion project on the main refrigeration system was completed in 2005.  \n\nAn additional refrigeration system was installed in 1999 to supply process cooling to a new freezer line.  This second refrigeration system does not handle anhydrous ammonia in quantities greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  \n\nIn the main system, the booster compressors draw low pressure ammonia vapors from the suction accumulators and compress the vapors.  The compressed ammonia vapors flow through the flash intercooler prior to entering the high stage compressors.  The high stage compressors increase the pressure of the ammonia vapor stream.  Some of the heat of compression from the high stage compressors is removed via a shell and tube heat exchanger (to generate hot water for sanitation purposes) with the balance of the high stage compressor discharge being condensed in the evaporative condensers.  \n\nCondensed ammonia flows by gravity from the evaporative condensers to the receivers where the liquid ammonia is stored until process cooling demand requires more liquid ammonia.  When process cooling demand requires additional liquid ammonia, the ammonia flows from the receiver through an evaporative condenser (de-superheater) to subcool the liquid ammonia.  As needed, the subcooled liquid ammonia flows to the following process"

However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be \u00bfpumped down\u00bf to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receivers.  \n\nDreyer\u00bfs Ice Cream Company, Inc. conducted an ammonia inventory study of the main refrigeration system to determine the ammonia charge in the system after the completion of the 2005 expansion project.  The results of the ammonia inventory study indicated that the total ammonia charge of the ammonia system is currently at approximately 51,405 pounds.  High pressure receiver #2 (HPR 02) is the largest vessel in the main refrigeration system and can store the entire system charge of ammonia.\n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented at Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Inc. to address the anhydrous ammonia system.

Since the main refrigeration system handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Inc. has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the ammonia based refrigeration processes.  \n\nAs part of the PSM program, Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Inc. has completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration systems, conducted a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration systems on a daily basis, Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Inc. has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration system is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\n\nAdditionally, Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Inc. emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific and process specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, fire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  \n\nAn emergency action plan has been prepared for the Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Inc. facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.  In the event of an ammonia release, Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Inc. has personnel trained in emergency response procedures.  \n\nDreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Inc. has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  At least every three years, Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Inc. audits"
