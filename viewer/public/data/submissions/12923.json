The facility utilizes Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of milk and milk products within the facility. Anhydrous Ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves. \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Reiter Dairy Springfield facility is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize rel"

The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur. The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention. It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\nThe worst case release scenario (as defined by EPA) is the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint. The worst case release scenario for the refrigeration process is assumed to be a case where the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel is released. The release scenario was performed assuming that the vessel was filled to 90% capacity (the greatest amount that would ever be placed in the vessel). The vessel, however, is normally filled to 50% capacity. There are no passive mitigation systems (dikes, berms, drains, sumps or enclosures) considered in the analysis since the vessel located outdoors.\nI\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less. This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects. Based on Exhibit 4-4 in EPA's guidance, a release from the largest vessel would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint. \n\n In addition, Dean Foods has installed a sophisticated system of ammonia sensors that can remotely close certain isolation valves in the event of a small release and th"

These sensors are capable of detecting releases of ammonia at low levels, and are connected to a computer that will shut certain valves to the system if ammonia is detected. In this way, potential releases of ammonia are minimized.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario: The alternative case release scenario selected is one in which a pressure relief valve on an evaporative condenser releases. EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenario. The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\n\n2\n\nThe alternative release scenario must meet two criteria:\n1)     Must be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, and\n\n\n2)     Must reach an endpoint off site, unless no such criteria exist.\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less. Based on EPA's guidance, the alternative release scenario would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe Alternative case release scenario (as defined by EPA) is a scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario. The Alternative case release scenario for the refrigeration process is a scenario in which the evaporative condenser shuts down while the compressor is still running, excessive head pressure builds releasing the pressure relief valve. The release scenario was performed assuming 10-minute release duration where ammonia could be released to the atmosphere. There are no passive mitigation systems (dikes, berms, drains, sumps or enclosures) considered in the analysis, However failure of the evaporative condensers will sound an alarm and excessive head pressure will shut down the entir"

The 911 operator will notify the Clark County LEPC, Springfield EMS (Police, Fire, and Hazmat). In addition, the Clark County LEPC has included Reiter Dairy in its local emergency response planning.\nSteps to Improve Safety: Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Ammonia detectors are calibrated and tested annually, All Ammonia safety relief valves are replaced and tested on the manufacturer's recommended preventative maintenance schedules. All recommendations made by the accident review committee are implemented immediately. These are some of the major steps taken to improve safety at our facility. \n\nIn addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program.\n\nEmergency Response Information: As a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations,notifi"
