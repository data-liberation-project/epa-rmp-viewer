Informational training sessions with employees on response to an emergency has prepared them to respond in a safe manner. Our facility is a wastewater treatment plant and the wastewater is chlorinated for disinfection. One ton cylinders of chlorine are used in this process and there are usually between four to six cylinders on site. Two cylinders are manifolded at one time. With one is in use and the other is on stand-by. The worst case scenerio at this facility would be the release of a one ton cylinder.Vacuum check regulators are in place on each cylinder.For a release to occur the two checks would have to fail.These regulators are cleaned and inspected every six months. Our system also includes chlorine leak detectors on are telemetry system both inside and outside. There has never been a chlorine release that could not be routinely handled.The employees at the treatment facility have been trained to respond to leaks and are knowledgable of the emergency agencies to notify if a leak cannot be contained immediately. Mock drills will and have been conducted for all personel and community notification will be done with the cooperation of the Evansville Fire Department and Local Emergency Management Agency. Environmental Management Corporation and the City of Evansville will continue to monitor the chlorine process and take all necessary measures to prevent any accidental release. The safety of our employees and the community we serve is our number one priority. The Wastewater Treatment facility has installed new entrance gates with card readers and is monitored through a computer system. We have the capability of knowing who has entered the facility a"
