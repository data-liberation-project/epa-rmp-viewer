The RMP meets and addresses the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.\n\nThe Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response polices at the stationary source.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled.\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\nThe five year accident history.\nThe emergency response program; and\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release prevention and emergency response all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this RMP, Fresh Express is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventative maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of Fresh Express?s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, Fresh Express is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis and Off-Site Consequence Analysis.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Fresh Express Carrollton facility.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydr"

      "SummaryText": "ous ammonia system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nA ?Worst Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis? and an ?Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 PPM.  The results are mitigated by the fact that most of the vessels and some of the piping are inside the Fresh Express facility building.  The mitigating measures (i.e., vessel inside facility, etc.) existing at the facility are incorporated into the computer Heavy gas modeling (Aloha) of the ?Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis as is permitted in the new EPA release ?Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration? 40CFR Part 68.  The Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis used here does not incorporate mitigating effects and uses the Gaussian dispersion model.  There are a multitude of engineering and Administrative Safeguards (i.e., high level cutouts, vessel size, and system operation) that were used to determine worst case and alternative release amounts possible.\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of this RMP.  Fresh Express has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Fresh Express conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan.\n\nAddressing the five-year accident history is not an issue., since the facility has had no reportable accidents within the last 5 years.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Fresh Express implemented a detailed Process Safety and Risk Management Program.  The program complies with the EPA?s Preventive Program 3.  Preventive Program 3 provides extensiv"

Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventive programs are updated as the facility system expands and changes.\n\nFresh Express will address and incorporate into processes and procedures any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, incident investigations and program audits.  The flexibility of the program will allow Fresh Express to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing Fresh Express employees, the surrounding public, and / or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
