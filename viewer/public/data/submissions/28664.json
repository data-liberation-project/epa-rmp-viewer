Details on our worst-case release scenario may be found in Section 2 of this Risk Mangement Plan.\n\n4.  Alternative-Case Release Scenario:  The alternative-case release scenario is a release from a transfer hose failure.  Details on our alternative-case release scenario may be found in Section 3 of this Risk Management Plan.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program:  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institure, Inc., and the Standard of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR Part 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n6.
