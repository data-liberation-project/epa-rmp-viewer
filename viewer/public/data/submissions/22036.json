As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Palatka. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consist of three elements:\r\n\r\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide and chlorine) - see topic 1.2\r\n\r\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\r\n\r\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\r\n\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Risk Management"

GP/Palatka provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President Pulp and Paper /Palatka Operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2\tGeorgia-Pacific Palatka Operations and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nGeorgia-Pacific Palatka Operations is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of brown/bleached pulp and paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (C102) for the use of bleaching pulp. The facility stores and transfers chlorine for use in bleaching pulp, in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP Rule. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of the chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP-covered processes in Program Level 3. The Chlorine System, which includes the 90-ton railcar and distribution system for the Bleach Plant, is considered RMP-covered processes in Program Level 3.  The threshold quantity for Chlorine is approximately 90 tons during peak operations in each system.  The threshold quantity for Chlorine Dioxide is approximately 53,460 pounds (428,000 gallons at a 15 gram per liter (1.5% in solution) strength) during peak operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3\tOff-Site Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nGP/Palatka performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substances to affect the public or the environment.

An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like GP/Palatka and (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred.  The alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distances. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide or chlorine, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Palatka Operations. These requirements include:\r\n\r\n* one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario representing chlorine)\r\n* one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine and one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Georgia-Pacific Palatka Operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process - Chlorine (C12) System and the Chlorine Dioxide (C102) Solution System\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for the chlorine system is the rupture of the 90-ton railcar.

Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System and the Chlorine System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well.

The most important products of the PHA are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases. The facility ensures that all recommendations from the PHAs are resolved appropriately, and the facility ensures that information from the PHAs (including recommended resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees.\r\n\r\n3.l\tProcess Hazard Analysis Details\r\n\r\nThe facility conducts systematic PHAs of the regulated processes and other hazardous processes at the facility according to an established schedule. This schedule ensures that the facility, (1) addresses each process in a prioritized order (based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees and/or off site population, the age of the process, and the operating history of the process) and (2) updates/revalidates each PHA at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). The facility also conducts PHAs of all new processes before those processes are placed in service.\r\n\r\nThe facility primarily uses the What-If' and HAZOP techniques to perform PHAs, although the facility can use other EPA/OSHA-approved techniques when they are more appropriate for specific applications.\r\n\r\nThe facility PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience, including at least one person who has knowledge and experience in the process to be eval"

The facility documents the final resolution of each recommendation, and advises the PHA team of any recommendations that are rejected.\r\n\r\n4.0 OPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.69 of the RMP Rule, the facility uses operating procedures to define how process-related job tasks assigned to personnel should be performed to avoid incidents.
