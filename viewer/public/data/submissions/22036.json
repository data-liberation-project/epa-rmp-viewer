Executive Summary\n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Palatka Operations (GP/Palatka) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for GP/Palatka workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Palatka. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consist of three elements:\n\n\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide and chlorine) - see topic 1.2\n\n\n\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n\n\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Risk Management"

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substances and injuries and damage resulting from the release of hazardous substances.\n\n\n\nGP/Palatka minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When the hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nGP/Palatka limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility works with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event a release does occur.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at GP/Palatka consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule.

GP/Palatka provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President Pulp and Paper /Palatka Operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2    Georgia-Pacific Palatka Operations and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Palatka Operations is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of brown/bleached pulp and paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (C102) for the use of bleaching pulp. The facility stores and transfers chlorine for use in bleaching pulp, in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP Rule. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of the chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP-covered processes in Program Level 3. The Chlorine System, which includes the 90-ton railcar and distribution system for the Bleach Plant, is considered RMP-covered processes in Program Level 3.  The threshold quantity for Chlorine is approximately 90 tons during peak operations in each system.  The threshold quantity for Chlorine Dioxide is approximately 53,460 pounds (428,000 gallons at a 15 gram per liter (1.5% in solution) strength) during peak operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3    Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nGP/Palatka performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substances to affect the public or the environment.

An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like GP/Palatka and (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred.  The alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distances. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide or chlorine, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Palatka Operations. These requirements include:\n\n\n\n* one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario representing chlorine)\n\n* one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine and one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Georgia-Pacific Palatka Operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process - Chlorine (C12) System and the Chlorine Dioxide (C102) Solution System\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the chlorine system is the rupture of the 90-ton railcar.

Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System and the Chlorine System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the RMP also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1 The following sections briefly describe the twelve elements of the Georgia-Pacific Palatka Operations Program Level 3 prevention program that addresses the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements for the Chlorine Systems and Chlorine Dioxide Solution Systems.\n\n\n\n1.

GP/Palatka explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the facility safe work practices, and the emergency response procedures for the facility. The facility requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work on or near a covered process before that employee begins work at the site. The facility periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n\n\n7. Pre-startup Safety Reviews.  GP/Palatka performs a safety review of new or modified equipment in the covered process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely. This review confirms that:\n\n\n\n-    construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\n\n\n-    adequate safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place\n\n\n\n-    employee training has been completed\n\n\n\n-    for a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified.\n\n\n\nA pre-startup safety review checklist is completed to document the review and"

Incident Investigations.  GP/Palatka investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented. The facility trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. An incident investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigations are documented, recommendations are resolved and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n\n\n12. Compliance Audits.  GP/Palatka audits the covered processes to be certain that the facility's prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the operations. The facility assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP Rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP Rule and also whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3    Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, GP/Palatka has implemented safety features specific to the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System. Chlorine Dioxide is produced at the facility and stored as a diluted aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution. Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where as high as 15 gram-per-liter (1.5% by weight)"
