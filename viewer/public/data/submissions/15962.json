Seq.  The regulations are also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 68.  \n\nFoster Farms prepared a RMP to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia and chlorine handling systems and practices at the facility. Foster Farms incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration and chlorine injection systems at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications. Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia and chlorine handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team.  \n\nFTP 2 is located at 711 F Street in Turlock, California.  The facility was constructed in 1978 and purchased by Foster Farms from the Grange Company in 1982.  Operations at the facility consist of further processing, fabrication, and packaging of poultry deli products.  The facilities are located on approximately two acres bordered by 8th Street to the west, Americold cold storage to the east, Valley Fresh Inc. to the north, and"

      "SummaryText": " F Street to the south.  The properties surrounding the facility have industrial businesses to the east and north and residences to the south and west of the facility.  The Foster Farms facility is surrounded by a security fence, prohibiting unauthorized access.  Additionally, the entrance to the facility is staffed by plant security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system at the facility.  The system provides cooling for production areas, storage areas, freezers, and water chilling.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  Ammonia is used as the heat transfer media in the refrigeration system.  As the ammonia passes through heat exchangers in the various refrigerated areas or units, heat is transferred to the ammonia thus cooling the air, water, or product that is giving up heat.  The ammonia is then compressed and passes through a condenser where the ammonia gives up heat to air and water.  The ammonia then cycles back through the heat exchangers to repeat the process.  Anhydrous ammonia is a commonly used industrial refrigerant due to its relatively efficient heat transfer characteristics.\n\nGaseous chlorine is used at FTP 2 for disinfecting.  Gaseous chlorine is injected into various water streams at the plant to maintain chlorine concentrations in water as required by the regulatory agencies governing poultry processing.  Chlorine containers are stored at the injection system location along the exterior of the north wall of FTP 2.  The portable chlorine containers have a capacity of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\nThe chlorine injection system consists of a container of liquid and gaseous chlorine under pressure connected to an injection system.  Vacuum regulators attached to the containers allow gaseous chlorine to pass into the injection system when the re"

The maximum amount of chlorine in a one-ton container is 2,000 pounds.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  Foster Farms knows of no reportable releases at the facility within the required reporting period.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to FTP 2 due to the quantity of ammonia and chlorine used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate one worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) for a facility and an alternative release scenario for each covered chemical. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"the greatest amount held in a single vesselreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.  For facilities with multiple processes, the regulations require that the worst-case scenario with the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint must be modeled.  Additional worst-case scenarios are not required if the affected populations from worst-case release scenarios from other processes are within the populations affected by the selected scenario.  \n\nA release of chlorine from a one-ton container results in the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint for FTP 1.  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for the facility is a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes.  Catastrophic failure of the chlorine container would be required for this scenario to occur.  \nAssuming pessimistic atmospheric conditions, very conservative chemical dispersion characteristics, and a toxic endpoint of three parts per mil"

The EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, October 1998, was used for the chemical dispersion analysis.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered in the analysis. \n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, Foster Farms modeled an alternative release scenario for each toxic substance contained in a process covered by RMP regulations.  Foster Farms modeled an alternative release scenario described in the above referenced EPA guidance document for chorine.  The release scenario is described as a 1/4-inch effective diameter orifice leading to an airborne release, representative of a faulty regulator or valve.  The evaluation used a release rate of 150 pounds/minute and average weather conditions.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles.\n\nFoster Farms used the alternative release scenario for ammonia described in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998, for an ammonia release from the facility.  The release scenario is described as a <-inch effective diameter orifice leaking liquid ammonia and resulting in an airborne release, representative of a pipe connection leak or a gasket rupture.  The evaluation used a release rate of 88.9 pounds/minute and average weather conditions.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.08 miles, or approximately 399 feet.  The SLAB Model was used for modeling the alternative release scenario.  SLAB was first developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.  SLAB has been revised and updated by the USAF Engineering and Services Center and the American Petroleum Institute.  SLAB is commonly used to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of denser-than-air releases.\n\nThe RMP "

The primary concerns are over-pressurization, physical damage to the chlorine containers and damage/ deterioration to associated piping and tubing.  Locating the chlorine storage area on the north-facing exterior wall helps to mitigate the potential for over-pressurization that may be caused by exposure to direct sunlight. \n\nThe chlorine containers at FTP 2 are protected from vehicle traffic by guard posts and barriers.  The containers are stored on cradles and storage racks designed for chlorine containers.  The potential for a significant release at the injection system due to damage to connected tubing and piping is greatly minimized by the use of vacuum regulators at the cylinders.  Additionally, flexible tubing used in the system is replaced upon signs of weathering.\n\nSafety features for the chlorine injection system include:\n7 A chlorine leak detection system is installed for the chlorine injection system\n7 Vacuum regulators at the containers\n7 Rebuild/replace regulators on a prescribed schedule\n7 A computerized preventive maintenance program is used at the facility\n7 Fire alarm and sprinkler system throughout the plant\n7 Facility is located in a fenced, secured area\n7 Containers are protected by guard posts and barriers\n7 Containers are stored on cradles and racks designed for chlorine containers\n\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration and the chlorine injection systems at the facility, Foster Farms has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system.

The Foster Farms ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The major pressure vessels in all of the systems at FTP 2 are connected to a diffusion panel.
