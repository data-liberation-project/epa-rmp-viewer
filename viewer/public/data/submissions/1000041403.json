This is due to security concerns as dictated by the Homeland Security Act.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. This anhydrous ammonia system is installed and maintained in accordance with all regulations and state law.  Note:  The state of Kansas has not yet adpoted the most recent version of the ANSI standards.  However, this company understands the importance of keeping our facilities safe and we will committ the needed time and funds to make any needed repairs.\n\n\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy (Emergency Action Plan)  to notify the Norwich Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department.
