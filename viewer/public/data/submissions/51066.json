      "SummaryText": "The ONEOK North System, L.L.C. Iowa City Terminal is a propane truck loading terminal.  The maximum quantity of propane that could be stored on site is 560,000 gallons (2,400,000 pounds).  The facility receives propane by pipeline, stores the propane in eight 63,000 gallon (water capacity) tanks and then loads propane onto customer's highway transport trucks.  The facility also has storage capacity for up to 13,000 pounds of ethyl mercaptan.  The ethyl mercaptan is an odorant that is injected into the propane during truck loading for safety requirements.\n\nProcess controls are in place at the facility to prevent or minimize an emergency release which include automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices and grounding equipment.  In addition the facility has UV/IR fire detection \"eyes\" process area detectors.\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for the facility is the entire release of a full propane storage tank which is 57,000 gallons (240,000 pounds), resulting in a vapor cloud expolsion.  Under EPA requirements the WCS assumes weather conditions that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are functioning.  Based on these assumptions, the WCS could potentially affect nearby public receptors.  The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the potential for the worst case scenario to occur.\n\nThe facility complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) regulations, including the process safety management (PSM) requirements.  Facility personnel undergo operations competency training and testing including emergency response training drills.  Agencies also receive SARA Tier II Chemical Inventory reports annually.  In addition, the facility is inspected per the compliance auditing schedule under OSHA PSM and conducts a Process Hazard Analysis update every 5 years.\n\nThere has been only one reportable"
