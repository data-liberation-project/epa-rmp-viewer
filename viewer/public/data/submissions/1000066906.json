This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\nBrazos Midstream Operating, LLC owns and operates the Comanche Plant, a natural gas processing plant, located at latitude 31.3132222 and longitude -103.226028 in Reeves County, Texas.  The facility has two separate and distinct plants that are each RMP-regulated processes. Comanche is a natural gas processing plant that receives unprocessed natural gas from pipelines, which has gathered the gas from its producer's facilities.  The plant utilizes a cryogenic recovery process removing natural gas liquids for fractionation.  The Comanche Plant delivers the final product via pipeline.  The regulated flammable substances identified at the facility are NGL, propane and unstabilized condensate.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Results:\r\nUnstabilized condensate stored in V-3020 was determined to result in the WCS.  The distance to the endpoint of 1-psi overpressure for the worst-case release of the flammable mixture was calculated and determined to have the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Toxic chemicals are not present in excess of RMP threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\nThe Comanche Plant is a new facility; therefore, this facility has not had any"

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors:\r\nThe Comanche Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
