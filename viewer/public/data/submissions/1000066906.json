This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nBrazos Midstream Operating, LLC owns and operates the Comanche Plant, a natural gas processing plant, located at latitude 31.3132222 and longitude -103.226028 in Reeves County, Texas.  The facility has two separate and distinct plants that are each RMP-regulated processes. Comanche is a natural gas processing plant that receives unprocessed natural gas from pipelines, which has gathered the gas from its producer's facilities.  The plant utilizes a cryogenic recovery process removing natural gas liquids for fractionation.  The Comanche Plant delivers the final product via pipeline.  The regulated flammable substances identified at the facility are NGL, propane and unstabilized condensate.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Results:\n\nUnstabilized condensate stored in V-3020 was determined to result in the WCS.  The distance to the endpoint of 1-psi overpressure for the worst-case release of the flammable mixture was calculated and determined to have the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Toxic chemicals are not present in excess of RMP threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThe Comanche Plant is a new facility; therefore, this facility has not had any "

Because processes at the Comanche Plant that are regulated by the EPA Risk\n\nManagement Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management\n\n(PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nThe Comanche Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Comanche Plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Comanche Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the Comanche Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nThe Comanche Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific employees within the Comanche Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

For specific process areas, the Comanche Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The Comanche Plant ensures that the process is maintained within instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Comanche Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n\nThe Comanche Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Comanche Plant periodically updates and revalidated the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings form these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe Comanche Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nThe Comanche Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Comanche Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) supply contractors with a process overview, (6) information about safety and health hazards, (7) emergency response plan requirements and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nThe Comanche Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.
