The Century Gas Plant is designed to separate the feed gas into two marketable fractions, pipeline quality natural gas and pipeline quality CO2.\r\n   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency\r\nOccidental Permian, Ltd's. Century Gas Plant (CGP) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release safeguards and programs, along with emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public and to protect the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, CGP personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\r\n   Process Overview\r\nThe processing plant consist of two trains of two units each, a bulk CO2 removal unit and a CO2 polishing unit. (Currently Train 2 is decommissioned - Non-operational)\r\nThe bulk removal unit is a duel refrigerant CO2 fractionation unit (DRCFU) which will reduce the CO2 content in the hydrocarbon stream from approximately 65% to approximately 22%.\r\nThe finishing unit will extract a majority of the remaining CO2 from the residue gas so that the product natural gas stream will meet gas transmission pipeline sales specifications.\r\nThe CO2 stream from the finishing unit will be recycled to the dual refrigerant CO2 fractionation unit (DRCFU).  The CO2 product stream will exit the dual refrigerant CO2 fractionation unit (DRCFU) and will be delivered to the CO2 sales pipeline.\r\n   RMP Overview\r\nThe Century Gas Plant qualifies as a Program Level 1 facility due to the presence of methane, the absence"

Century Gas Plant is not required to have a specific prevention program; however, we do have an active Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which incorporates accidental release prevention. \r\nCentury Gas Plant maintains a written emergency action plan to control and contain an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provide first aid and medical treatment for exposures.  It also contains plans for evacuation, accounting for personnel after the evacuation, and notification of emergency response agencies.  We have coordinated our emergency response activities with the Pecos County LEPC.\r\n   Planned Changes to improve Safety\r\n1.\tWe will continue to develop and utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing CGP incidents.\r\n2.\tWe will continue to develop and share management practice involving operations and maintenance activities between Occidental Plants.\r\n3.\tWe will review our active process safety management program from time to time for appropriate improvements to the program.\r\n   Certification\r\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specific endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\r\nWithin the past five years the CGP process has had no accidental release that caused off-site impacts provided in 40 CFR 68.10 (b)(1).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent off-site impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of the regulated substance for the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a"
