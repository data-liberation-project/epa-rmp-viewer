We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.  It is our policy to control our processes to prevent the accidental release of harmful or noxious materials that could endanger or irritate our employees, plant visitors, or neighbors.  This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\n\nHydrite uses four chemicals regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management Program and the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program.  These chemicals are Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Aqueous Ammonia, and Anhydrous Ammonia.  The on-site storage capacity for Chlorine is 70,000 pounds, 12,000 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide.  Aqueous and Anhydrous Ammonia are present in quantities less than the regulatory threshold quantity.    \n\nRegulated materials are received from various suppliers and stored in compressed gas cylinders.  These containers meet DOT specifications.  All storage and ancillary equipment is designed to comply with National Standards including the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Fertilizer Institute, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and OSHA.\n\nHydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance.  Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process"

      "SummaryText": " hazards.  All processes are subject to the OSHA PSM program and as such, undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis.  Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemical, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new chemicals.  Equipment maintenance procedures have been developed and implemented, including routine inspections and scheduled maintenance.  Hydrite Chemical believes that every incident has the potential for serious impact and conducts Incident Investigations to determine root cause and corrective action for all releases.\n\nA review of the previous five year accident history indicates no releases of regulated materials.\n\nThe EPA's RMP requires a worst case scenario that represents all regulated toxic substances.  The worst case scenario for a gas is based on the total loss of the maximum quantity stored in each vessel.  Release is assumed to occur over a 10 minute period with weather conditions as defined by EPA in the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Hydrite has elected to use the ALOHA modeling package to keep our scenarios comparable with the local emergency response providers.  The worst case scenario for Sulfur Dioxide has the greatest impact zone and does have off-site impacts.\n\nAlternate release scenarios are based on events that can reasonably be expected to occur.  The Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are stored in compressed cylinders which each contain 2000 pounds.  To mitigate the consequences of a release during a fire, the cylinders have fusible plugs.  In the event of fire, a foam suppression system is readily available.  Weather conditions used were as specified in the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Modeling was "

      "SummaryText": "conducted using ALOHA for the compressed gases.  \n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and maintains an Emergency Response Plan (Contingency Plan).   This Plan is integrated into the Local Emergency Planning Committees' (LEPC's) county wide plan.  The Plan is reviewed and updated as required.  Emergency Responders receive formal training on the Plan annually.  The Plan includes:\n\n   * Actions facility personnel must take in the event of fire, explosion or release\n\n   * Arrangements with the local and state governments in the event of an accident\n\n   * Names, addresses and telephone numbers of all emergency responders\n\n   * Necessary emergency equipment and how it is to be implemented\n\nCottage Grove has a Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC) which is reviewed and approved triennially by a Professional Engineer. \n\nHydrite Chemical is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility and continually works to improve processes or procedures that advance our goal of zero releases."
