The Emergency Coordinator will contact the appropriate local response organizations and, as necessary, State and federal agencies.  The Plan contains a call list designating these contacts.\r\nIn the event of severe weather, Royal is dedicated to protecting its employees and the surrounding community.  Procedures have been set up to warn plant employees and shut down key operations in order to minimize impact in the event of a weather related failure.  The severe weather procedure is available for review at the site.\r\nRoyal regularly receives shipments of acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate in tank trucks and transfers these materials into dedicated above-ground storage tanks located within the Monomer Tank Farm.  The Monomer Tank Farm is complete with secondary containment.  Tank trucks are unloaded at a dedicated unloading station by trained personnel.  Royal has a documented ISO-9001 procedure for these operators to follow.  During delivery, the vapor in the headspace of these tanks is vented back to the delivering tanker.  Normal breathing losses from the acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate storage tanks are vented through conservation vents to a thermal oxidizer.\r\nRoyal controls the emissions of the odorous acrylate esters, vinyl acetate, and acrylonitrile with two thermal oxidizers operated interchangeably; usage is rotated between the two units.  Breathing losses from the monomer storage tanks, emissions from the weigh tanks, and emissions from the reactors are collected in separate manifolds for treatment in the thermal oxidizer.\r\nIt is Royal's philosophy that all employees will be trained to perform their assigned d"

The RMP threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 for vinyl acetate monomer is 15,000 pounds.  Royal uses vinyl acetate as a raw material in an emulsion polymerization reaction and stores a quantity greater than the threshold amount in its monomer tank farm.  Royal has not had an accident or incident involving a reportable quantity of vinyl acetate in the last five years.\r\nRoyal does not designate employees for response other than to address incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel, or by employees to clean-up a spill that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  These actions are not considered response under OSHA or Part 68; therefore, Royal is a non-responding facility [40 CFR 68.90(b)].  For non-responding facilities, EPA has adopted a policy similar to OSHA in its Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) [29 CFR 1910.120]. This allows these facilities to develop an emergency action plan to ensure employee safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response plan provided that they coordinate with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the facility.\r\nRoyal operates in a manner that attempts to minimize hazards associated with the handling of chemicals.  Royal has several mechanisms in place for addressing a release of a regulated hazardous substance.  These include the following:\r\na) An Integrated Contingency Plan\r\nb) Written Safety Programs\r\nc) Written safe operating procedures, including one for unloading bulk railcars and tank trucks\r\nThe Integrated Contingency Plan contains detailed information relating to materials stored on site, potential on-site eme"

To this end, ISO procedures were created to provide work instructions and training documentation tools for effectively and systematically planning training initiatives, assessing training needs, providing required employee training, and maintaining appropriate training records. \r\nIn order to ensure an efficient workplace, preventive maintenance is performed on a majority of the equipment at Royal.  These procedures are documented and a copy of the related ISO procedure is available for review at the site.  Royal has established a Management of Change procedure so that formulation, process, or equipment modifications and installations are reviewed prior to implementation to assure that safety issues are appropriately addressed, changes are communicated, and documentation is updated.\r\nRoyal occasionally brings in outside contractors for specific tasks.  Any contractor that is performing work in the manufacturing facility is given a safety briefing that includes:\r\na) Emergency Evacuation Plan\r\nb) Site Safety Rules\r\nc) Location of Fire Extinguishers, Fire Exits, and emergency Eye Wash/Shower Stations\r\nd) Location of and access to Safety Data Sheets\r\ne) Specific Hazards Workers May be Exposed To.\r\nFurther, a detailed review of the proper use of facility equipment and implementation of applicable Safety Programs (i.e., Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout/Tagout, etc.) takes place as triggered."

      "SummaryText": "The Royal Adhesives & Sealants (Royal) site is located on a 130-acre parcel of land near Simpsonville (Greenville County), South Carolina.  Royal produces acrylic polymers through water-based emulsion polymerization reactions.  This process utilizes a number of chemicals as raw materials, three of which are listed as toxics under 40 CFR 68.130: acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and aqueous ammonia.  Less than 2% of a fourth listed compound, formaldehyde, is a residual reactant in a monomer, N-methylolacrylamide.  Two of these chemicals, acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate monomer, are present in quantities above the threshold limits set forth for the RMP program.  Furthermore, the process in which these chemicals are used is listed under SIC code 2821, making Royal subject to level 3 program requirements.\r\nAcrylonitrile is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid.  Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of acrylonitrile include irritation of the respiratory tract experienced as nasal discomfort and discharge, with chest pain, coughing, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness.  At high doses acrylonitrile can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact and other routes.  The threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 for acrylonitrile is 20,000 pounds.  Royal uses acrylonitrile as a raw material in an emulsion polymerization reaction and stores a quantity greater than the threshold amount in its monomer tank farm.  Royal has not had an accident or incident involving a reportable quantity of acrylonitrile in the last five years.\r\nVinyl acetate monomer is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid.
