It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Ocheyedan Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Osceola County, Iowa LEPC (Region 3 Emergency Planning District) will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Ocheyedan, Iowa location is Steve Glade, agronomy sales and operations manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n                      Steve Glade, agronomy sales and operations manager\n                               WORK:    (712) 758-3621\n                               24-Hour:   (712) 758-3241\n                               Cell:         (712) 461-1721\n\n             "

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nThe system consists of one (1) 11,800-gallon, one (1) 12,000-gallon, one (1) 26,000-gallon and one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year as many as sixty-five (65) 1,000-gallon and twelve (12) 1,500-gallon portable nurse tanks may also be present at the site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is two (2).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1)  30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.07), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling aw"

The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nThe system is protected by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and emergency shut-off valves. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\nThere is one (1) 10,000 gallon LP Gas storage tank located approximately 198 feet southwest of the one (1) 26,000 gallon NH3 tank, one (1) 30,000 gallon LP Gas storage tank located approximately 146 feet south of the one (1) 30,000 gallon NH3 tank, and one (1) 30,000 gallon LP Gas storage tank located approximately 1050 feet east of the one (1) 30,000 gallon NH3 storage tank. It is believed that it is unlikely that any of the three(3) LP Gas storage vessels would be likely to be impinged upon in the event that any unfortuitous event were to occur at theanhydrous ammonia plant reported in this plan. However, for emergency planning preparedness these vessels are included in the executive summary section of this Plan.\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Ocheyedan,  provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1989 with amendments and State law. \n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.

In the unlikely event that the Ocheyedan Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Ocheyedan location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Ocheyedan has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Osceola County LEPC (Region 3 Emergency Planning District). Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nAs indicated previously in the Worst-case and alternative release section of this summary, there is one (1) 10,000-gallon and two (2) 30,000-gallon propane storage tanks situated across the street from the anhydrous plant. A worst-case scenario for a propane release resulting in a vapor cloud explosion has been computed utilizing EPA's RMP*Comp (1.06 Version). The distance to endpoint for either size tank is 0.4 miles. At the current time propane has been exempted from Risk Management Planning. However, we have con"

Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites  local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.\n\nIn addition to the evaluation of the anhydrous ammonia plant at this site, an evaluation was also made of the potential effects of a release at one of the two (2) propane supply tanks at this site. One tank is situated approximately 200 feet diagonally across the street to the southwest from the anhydrous plant. The second vessel is situated approximately 146 feet south of the anhydrous plant across the street. As indicated in the process description for anhydrous ammonia, employees working at the propane plants also make routine observations of the propane plant.
