(Kraft) facility in Springfield, Missouri has a good record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  The Kraft facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented the SAP electronic preventive maintenance system that uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at the Kraft facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Springfield Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nAt this location Kraft manufactures and produces dairy products.  The NAICS code for the primary process at this facility is 311514.  This facility is capable of producing various dairy products including cheese for consumer intake.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the dairy products.  Some of these areas include coolers, chillers, storage tanks, and some processes.  The plant also produces some pasta products  \r\n\r\nKraft has one regulated substance under 40 CFR Part 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas described above.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.

Thus, 40 CFR Part 68 is applicable to the Kraft plant in Springfield, MO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\tWorse-Case & Alternate Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe RMP*Comp dispersion model was used to complete an off-site consequence analysis of ammonia dispersion to determine the radius (end-point) of impact on the surrounding community. The RMP*Comp is a computer model developed by the USEPA.\r\n\r\nWorst Case: The largest potential release of ammonia would occur with a catastrophic failure of the\r\nhigh-pressure receiver.  Taking the specific definition of the worst-case from 40 CFR\r\n68.25, the largest quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel is in the high\r\npressure receiver during a pump-out condition.  The total quantity of ammonia that can be\r\nstored in the high-pressure receiver is 23,138 without administrative controls. \r\nSince the vessel is located outdoors, it is assumed that the entire 23,138 pounds is released into the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  The release rate is 2,313.8 lb./min. Refined computer modeling using the SLAB model was used to obtain the distance to endpoint which is 0.9 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternate Case: An alternative scenario was selected for reporting which has a relatively high probability of occurrence and has a distance to endpoint that extends off-site: an ammonia release from the PRV's on the high pressure receiver which is located approximately 200 ft from the fence line.  This produces a horizontal jet release.  There is no applicable administrative controls or passive mitigation.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention (PRV is shutdown at 10 minutes from the start of the release). The ammonia vapor cloud was calculated to be above 200 ppm on the ground level at a distance of 0.1 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nKraft has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration systems.

EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\r\n\r\n1.  The Utility Service Area design (USA) serves as an excellent safeguard for plant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping inside occupied rooms.  Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\r\n2. \tThe plant maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\r\n3.\tAn electronic control monitoring system and emergency shut down system is in place for the entire engine room process.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAccording to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response plan in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are nine in-plant contacts for an emergency, a list of these contacts can be found in the Emergency Response Plan.  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, as well as a detailed description of the training content.  There are also specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire and ammonia emergency.  Response team members participate in a mock spill cleanup annually.  All trained ER team members have pagers/phones that can be activated.\r\n\r\nAt the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Springfield Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment."
