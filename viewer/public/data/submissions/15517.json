      "SummaryText": "Trenton Municipal Utilities is very committed to safety in all of its facilities.  Employees are held to the highest safety standards.  The water plant serves Trenton's population of over 6800 plus the Public Water Supply District for Grundy county.  We are dedicated to supplying quality water and a safe environment to all of our customers and employees.\n\nThe Trenton Municipal Utilities water plant is located at 1043 Crowder Road on top of a hill.  The water plant's primary activity is to produce an average of 3 million gallons of water per day, with a total capacity of 4.5 million gallons per day.  The regulated substance that we use at the water plant is chlorine.  The water plant uses about 60 pounds of chlorine a day, and may have up to eight thousand pounds in inventory at any one time.\n\nThe worst case scenario release of chlorine is a plan that is designed to indicate whether you have your release contained on site or if the release will affect the general public.  The guidelines we used to reach the end point of the worst case scenario was the Risk Management Plan's trade mark submitted by E.P.A. 550-B99-001,  Feb. 1999 via the internet at www.epa.gov/ceppo/.  The worst case scenario release was factored into the program at wind speed of 15 m.p.h., temperature of 77 degrees, and a release of 2000 pounds of chlorine at 200 pounds a minute for 10 minutes.  The end point of a release is .9 miles.\n\nThe worst case scenario release of 2000 pounds of chlorine would be if a tornado, earthquake, explosion, vandals, or fire occurs.  All assumptions assume worst case scenarios, which are very unlikely, but could happen.\n\nThe alternative scenario is what could, and may happen someday.  We used the same E.P.A. plan to calculate the end point of release of chlorine gas.  The numbers we used were .04 pounds release per minute. The time of release was 250 minutes. The total pounds released was 10 and wind speed was 15 m.p.h.  The end point is .1 mile or 528 feet away from th"

      "SummaryText": "e water plant.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been started by Trenton Municipal Utilities to check all equipment valve pipes on a regular timetable.  All employees at the water plant have been trained in safe handling of chlorine tanks.  Such training includes loading and unloading supplier shipments, connecting and disconnecting the tanks, and changing equipment in the plant.\n\nThere have not been any releases of chlorine in the last five years.  The main reason for this success is that Trenton Municipal Utilities has a good preventive maintenance program and keeps all employees trained in safe handling of chlorine.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is set up to shut down any leak and to evacuate any part of the public that may be in danger of a release of chlorine gas.  Trenton Municipal Utilities has trained the fire department Local Emergency Planning Coordinator (L.E.P.C.) to help with the shut down of the chlorine system in the case of an emergency.  The Police Department has a map of the release points that would be involved in the worst case scenario, or the alternative scenarios, for evacuation of people from the zone on the map.  The police would also assist with traffic control.  The D.N.R. and G.S. Robins, our chlorine supplier, would be called for help.  The hospital would be notified of any leak so they would know about and be prepared for any medical treatments needed.  In case of a chlorine release, the employees of Trenton Municipal Utilities and the local municipal fire department have been trained in the use of self contained breathing apparatuses (S.C.B.A.).  They will shut down or contain any leak to the best of their ability.  After the leak has been stopped, the cause will be determined and fixed.\n\nPlanned changes to Trenton Municipal Utilities water plant include adding an automatic shut-off on chlorine tanks, with leak detector sensors located in the water plant chlorine room, in underground pipes, and in the chlorine storage bui"

Plans also include keeping the Trenton Municipal Utilities employees, the L.E.P.C., the fire department, and the police department up to date on all safety and chlorine regulations and information.  In addition a new chlorine line will be run from the chlorine building to the chlorine room in the water plant.  Other improvements will be made as identified."
