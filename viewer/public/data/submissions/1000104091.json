The stationary source is the ammonia refrigeration system owned and operated by Boar\u0092s Head Provisions Co., Inc. \u0096 Jarratt. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. \nThis is an existing food processing facility.  The 2 refrigeration system(s) in this facility have an inventory approximately 59,249 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The processes do not meet the requirements of Program 1. They are subject to OSHA\u0092s PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\nFigure 1. Local area map of Jarratt facility. \n\n         \n\n\n\n\n1.2\t\tAccidental Release Prevention Policy\nThis facility follows a rigorous fourteen volume Process Safety Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. This RMP also addresses the PSM program in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the both process safety programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\n1.3\t\tEmergency Response Policy\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. \n\n\n1.4\t\tProcess Overview \nSystem 1 (ER-4) Overview: \nPROCESS & PROCESS CHEMISTRY\nThe process is the standard refrigeration cycle. It uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. The only substance inside the refrigeration system is ammonia. \nThe process causes the ammonia to boil into a gas and then cool into a liquid and then repeats the process.  The refrigeration system lowers the liquid pressure to lower the boiling point and then evaporates the ammonia within the system using room air as the heat source. It then compresses the ammoni"

High-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high-temperature compressors to the evaporative condenser where heat is removed, condensing the vapor to a high-pressure liquid.

The presence of non-condensable gases in the condenser penalizes the system performance through the artificial elevation of condensing pressure.
