MIA Products accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and emergency management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prevention Program are adhered to.  MIA Products emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan and the emergency response services available in the community. MIA Products is in compliance with all OSHA and EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB. MIA Products, is a producer of novelty ice products.  On site we have 15,500 lbs. of ammonia.  MIA Products uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to cool product and chill liquids.  The plant is normally manned around the clock during production hours.  Holidays and weekends the plant is monitored by alarm systems.\n\nC. The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the anhydrous ammonia release before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by EPA of 3 PPM, which is the Emergency Respouse Planning Guideline Level 3 (ERPG-3).  The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) defines this as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that all individuals could be exposed irreversible or other serious health effects or systems, which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.

The offsite consequence analysis for the scenario was performed for two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-3 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis\n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (116 degrees F.), and average humidity (65%) were used for both sets.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of .8 miles and an estimate of residential population potential affected  2550. \n\nThe alternate release scenario involves the rupture of a Pipe.  The amount of release anhydrous ammonia released is 24 lbs./min. at an average rate over one hour (the duration of the release) of 44 lb./min.  Toxic endpoint distances to ERPG-2 and -3 levels were obtained.  The latter is defined by AIHA as \"the   maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experience or developing life threading health effects\".  The typical meteorological conditions used were Stability E, wind speed 3.0m/s, average air temperature of 62 degree F., and 63% average humidity.  The estimated distance traveled to the toxic endpoint is .43 ft. The estimated of residential population affected is 1520.\n\nD.

No accidental release of anhydrous ammonia has occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nF. The plant has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated by the Greenwood and Moosic Fire Department, and DATOM which are all members of the Local Emergency Response Planing Committee (LEPC).  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drills evaluations are conducted every six months: emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time."
