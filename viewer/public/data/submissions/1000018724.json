Compliance with EPA's Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68), Federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), and Cal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) is also be maintained. This plan has been developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia in a closed loop mechanical refrigeration system at Columbus Foods - 3190 Corporate Place, Hayward, California.  Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the facility requirements and defines design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  Columbus Foods has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with the CalARP rules as a result of meeting other regulatory program requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the CalARP requirements, that information is contained in this document.  Note:  Columbus has rewritten and improved the company's CalARP/RMP/PSM programs.  All documentation prior to this effort is on-hand and available; all new programs/policies implemented as a result of this effort are initiated and are being utilized moving forward.\n\n1.1.    Commitment to Safety\n\nColumbus Foods is committed to providing all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  We are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the enviro"

It is the policy of Columbus Foods to: \n\n1.1.1.1    Provide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\n1.1.1.2    Comply with all federal, state, and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.\n\n1.1.1.3    Ensure through training, and when necessary disciplinary action, that all employees work in a safe manner.\n\n \n1.1.1.4    Educate and/or train all employees in safe work practices, and ensure that each employee fully understands their job, equipment, techniques, and methods to reduce the risk to themselves and their co-workers.\n\n1.1.2.    Encourage all employees to \"Think Safety\", so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\n\n1.1.3.    Columbus Foods' aim is to provide high quality products as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials whereever possible.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, engineering/administrative controls to handle these substances will be implemented.\n\n1.1.4.    Columbus Foods has prepared a safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility in addition to establishing a Process Safety Management Program.  It is the responsibility of the facility's management to carry out these programs.\n\n1.1.5.    The first duty of Columbus Foods employees is to exercise care in the performance of their work tasks to prevent an accident to themselves, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n1.2.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n1.2.1.    Columbus will make all reasonable efforts to continually monitor and improve the safety of its systems\n1.2.2.

Columbus is committed to implementing the recommendations from these activities as a way of always improving safety.  \n1.2.3.    At the current time, other more substantial system-wide hardware, software, or other changes are not under consideration.\n\n\n1.3.    Columbus Foods Description\n\n1.3.1.    Columbus Foods is located at 3190 Corporate Place, Hayward, California. The facility is a salame processing, slicing, and packaging facility that receives raw materials from suppliers. The raw product is processed on site to make final and work in process products.  Final products are pushed into the company supply chain for distribution to customers and consumers.  Work in process products are transferred to other company or co-pack facilities for slicing and/or final packaging.\n\n1.3.2.    Anhydrous ammonia, which is regulated under CalARP, is utilized at Columbus Foods in the facility's ammonia refrigeration systems. Approximately 13,330 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is utilized for refrigeration in a single ammonia processes.  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, evaporators, condensers, compressors and miscellaneous refrigeration equipment located throughout the refrigeration system.  The ammonia refrigeration system operates at three temperature levels designed to cool air for various rooms.  Low, medium, and high temperature recirculated liquid is pumped throughout the process via refrigerant pumps.  The ammonia liquid flows through the coils of the air units where it absorbs heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The ammonia vapor is sent from the evaporators to the corresponding recirculator vessels and is then routed to the compressors. During the compression phase, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased.  The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the compressor to the evaporative condenser where heat is rejected, turning the amm"

The high pressure liquid is collected in the high pressure receiver and then flows to the three recirculator vessels where the process begins again.\n\n1.3.3.    As a result of the use of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant at Columbus Foods, the facility has developed and implemented a Level 3 Prevention Program in accordance with CalARP 2760 and 40 CFR 68.  Also in place is a Process Safety Management program as required by Cal OSHA Title 8, Section 5189 and OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119. A Management System has been developed to oversee the regulatory programs at the Columbus Foods facility.   \n\n1.4.    Worst/Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\n1.4.1.    Although engineering controls incorporated into the refrigeration process would normally prevent such releases, the possibility of a \"catastrophic release\" does exist.  Based on that premise, the facility has modeled two off site consequence analyses; one worst case scenario and one alternate case scenario. \n\n1.4.2.    For all scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp (Revision 1.07) modeling software was used to determine Off-Site Consequence Analyses.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for such a release and potential receptors are discussed in the facilities overall Risk Management Plan.\n\n1.5.    Emergency Response Program\n\n1.5.1.    Columbus Foods is equipped with emergency warning systems.
