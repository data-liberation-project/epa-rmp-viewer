(Air Liquide) operates a carbon dioxide (CO2) Facility in Delaware City, DE (Delaware City CO2 Plant) to produce liquid and solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) products for use in the food processing and preservation, pH control of water, fire protection and other applications. The manufacture of the liquid carbon dioxide requires the removal of heat at temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit.   The subzero heat removal is provided through a closed loop industrial anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process.  The Delaware City CO2 plant commenced liquid plant operations in April 1972 and dry ice in 2007. The site has 18 employees. Air Liquide's commitment to safety and environmental protection extends beyond its gates.  As part of the community, we have a responsibility to our customers and to those who live in the surrounding area.  \n\n \n\nRegulated Chemical\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is a listed highly hazardous substance under the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.   The Delaware City combined ammonia refrigeration process inventory is in excess of 10,000 pounds making the ammonia refrigeration process a RMP/PSM Covered Process.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nAir Liquide's Delaware City ammonia refrigeration process is covered by the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  The toxic nature of the ammonia in the process makes it necessary for Air Liquide to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Air Liquide's policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The summary below discusses some of the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nAir Liquide keeps a variety of technical do"

Process operators are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these operating limits.\n\n\n\nThe Plant Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan described below.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nAir Liquide has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and control.  The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and will continue to undergo periodic review/re-validations at least every five years.   The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the process and also represents a cross-section of the employees working in the process.  For upcoming PHA reviews, local and corporate management will review the PHA team findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Air Liquide action item database tracking system.  The Delaware City CO2 Plant manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the action plan.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nAir Liquide maintains written procedures that address various modes of ammonia refrigeration process operations, such as (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal and temporary operations; (3) unit shutdown; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) startup following an emergency shutdown; and (6) process deviation, consequence a"

These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAir Liquide has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the ammonia refrigeration process.  All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topic as:  general orientation, site rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response.  In addition, all operators are required to attend refresher training at least every three years.  Training is documented and tracked in an electronic document system. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nAir Liquide has established mechanical integrity (MI) practices and procedures, based on preventative philosophy, to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, and relief valves and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  \n\n\n\nThe MI program assists with the verification and suitability of new and existing process equipment and, as well as quality control of spare parts and modifications to existing process equipment.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nAir Liquide's management of change (MOC) procedure has established the requirements for ensuring that proposed process or equipment changes or changes indirectly affecting processes are evaluated, approved and documented prior to implementation th"

Upon closure, personnel whose assigned job functions are impacted by the MOC, are briefed and /or trained in the MOC requirements. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nAir Liquide ensures the safety of new/modified facilities or processes before placing those facilities or processes into service through the use of pre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs).  PSSRs are intended to ensure safety through confirmation that:  (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; (2) safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; (3) PHAs have been performed and recommendations resolved before startup of new plants or processes; (4) MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified facilities; and (5) training has been completed for affected employees.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Air Liquide conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accidental release prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Resolutions to the recommendations are documented, tracked and closed.  Once the resolutions have been completed, changes are communicated to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAir Liquide defines management systems and establishes the requirements for communicating, investigating and reporting of incidents at all facilities through the"

Employees are trained on and are provided access to the ammonia refrigeration process safety information.  The specific ways an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan.  Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation. Employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed, and they are involved in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are correct and recommend any necessary changes. \n\n\n\nSafe & Hot Work Permit System\n\nAir Liquide has a safe & hot work permit system in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  This system is comprised of a group of corporate procedures and standards under the life safety program.
