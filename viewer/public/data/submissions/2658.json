The Nemaha County Co-op Policy\n\nThe management and employees of Nemaha County Co-op Baileyville, KS facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the Nemaha County Co-op has in place a memorandum of understanding with the local fire department, to respond to and mitigate any release thus minimizing the impact of a release to the community and the environment.\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at this site is the storage and blending of crop production and crop protection products for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both application and for blending into mixed grades of crop production nutrients.   The maximum quantity handled would be 127602 pounds in our 30,000 gallon tank.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n7 The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage vessel released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 127602 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage vessel at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is 1.12 miles.\n \n7 The alternate release scenario is based on the five-year accident history {or the likely potential incident} is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is .56 miles.\n \n 4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe Nemaha County Co-op has implemented the provisions of \"safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., the standards of the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handlin"

      "FacilityID": 2658,
      "SummaryText": "g of anhydrous ammonia,\" and \"Kansas Anhydrous Ammonia Law and the Regulation Pertaining to Handling, Storing and Transportation of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n\n5.  The Five - Year Accident History\n\na.  There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at Baileyville, Ks facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Nemaha County Co-op Baileyville, Ks facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CFR 1910.38.}  The Nemaha County Co-op has provided to Kansas Department of Environmental Quality and the Nemaha County local emergency planning committee the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III {EPCRA}.  The Nemaha County Co-op has a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CFR 1910.120}, including a memorandum of understanding with the Nemaha County Fire Department for response to our facility.  Additionally, the Nemaha County Co-op has trained our employees {and local fire department} in accordance with OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations {at least annually} will be performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
