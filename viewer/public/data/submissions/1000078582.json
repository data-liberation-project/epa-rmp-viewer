      "SummaryText": "ASARCO LLC (Asarco) owns and operates a copper refinery and precious metals recovery plant at its Amarillo Copper Refinery (ACR), in Potter County, Amarillo, Texas.  Through the copper refining process, impurities such as gold, silver, nickel sulfate, and other by-products are recovered.  The process consists of electrolytic refining in which copper is separated from other metals by passing an electric current through a solution of copper sulfate and sulfuric acid.  Further processing steps lead to the recovery and refinement of other metals.\n\n\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to ACR because the plant handles and stores hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in excess of threshold quantities.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n\n\n1.    Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause, 112(r)(1), is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Asarco is committed to ensuring the safe operation of ACR, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  Asarco, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the plant and for the community by coordinating with the Amarillo/Potter/Randall Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n2.    Risk Management Plan - The copper refinery and selenium & tellurium recovery plant at ACR involves the handling and storage of two chemicals in excess of thresholds specified in 112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of 112(r), Asarco management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of these materials.  Programs have been established to prevent accidental releases and to train pers"

To date, no accidents with offsite impacts have occurred at these facilities.\n\nIn addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, Asarco is in compliance with the OSHA PSM, OSHA HAZWOPER, EPCRA, and EPA RCRA Contingency Planning requirements.  Asarco has also conducted a process hazard analysis on the SO2 process, the only PSM-covered process at ACR. \n\n\n\nAsarco has one program level 2 process involving HCl and one program level 3 processes involving SO2. \n\nAsarco has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  Asarco has active operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures; a trained fire brigade; and an evacuation plan for each area.  In addition, Asarco has coordinated emergency response with the LEPC.\n\n\n\nAsarco's management is committed to the following:\n\n-    Preventing accidents;\n\n-    Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n-    Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n-    Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Asarco operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n-    Being a good corporate citizen of Potter County.\n\n    With these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about Asarco's management of the risks associated with operating the copper refinery and selenium & tellurium recovery plant at ACR.  Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community.\n\n"
