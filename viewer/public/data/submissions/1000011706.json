ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     Maola Milk and Ice Cream recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of ammonia release incidents has been and will continue to be the basic responsibility of all Maola Milk and Ice Cream personnel who operate the refrigeration process.\n\n     The Maola Milk and Ice Cream PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its Ammonia Operating and Management systems.  The Maola Milk and Ice Cream PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     The Maola Milk and Ice Cream Emergency Response Program has been developed in cooperation, and with the support of the local Public Emergency Response Agency.  All Maola Milk and Ice Cream employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     Maola Milk and Ice Cream operates an Ammonia Refrigeration system.  Ammonia is a common industrial chemical with applications in a large number of industries such as Agriculture, Water Treatment, Food Storage Warehouses, Pharmaceuticals, Heat Treating and many, many more.  Ammonia has been listed by both EPA and OSHA as Hazardous Substance.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in quantities above the threshold limit.\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nDispersion cloud modeling studies have been performed as required by PSM/RMP regulations and the information developed has been used in the preparation of the Technical Studies and Reports that are also required.\n\n\nIV.

Maola Milk and Ice Cream considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be a \"living\" documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability and usefulness.\n\n     Maola Milk and Ice Cream emphasizes and insists on \"employee participation\" from their ammonia process operators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n    Maola Milk and Ice Cream provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program and management system with \"one-on-one\" teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia process employee.\n\n     Maola Milk and Ice Cream maintains a pro-active \"open-door\" policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia during the past five years that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n     Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia releases. The site emergency plan has been coordinated with local Public Emergency  Responders.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      Maola Milk and Ice Cream recognizes that even good PSM/RMP Programs require constant attention and improvement.  The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" truly becomes \"second nature\".\n\n     Maola Milk and Ice Cream expects to improve PSM/RMP and safety performance by emphasizing the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program:\n\n (1)   Employee Participation is the \"Key\" to a successful program. Ammonia Process Managers and Operators have been deeply involved in Verifying P&ID's, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections.\n\n(2)    The Maola Milk and Ice Cream PSM/RMP Program is:  (a) computer based,  (b)user friendly,  (c) includes \"one-on-one\" involvement with specified and qualified trainers,  (d) written to minimize paperwork and maximize documentation, and  (e) written to be understood and used by both Ammonia Managers and Process Operators. \n\n(3)   All recommendations developed during the PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA) were designed to improve the safety performance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Maola Milk and Ice Cream expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release.\n\n(4)  Programs are audited regularly to improve the process as well as to verify compliance with the PSM/RMP Regulations."
