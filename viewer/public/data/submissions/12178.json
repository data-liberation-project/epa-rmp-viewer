      "SummaryText": "Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation\nEPA Risk Management Plan\nJune 21, 1999\nExecutive Summary\n\nGeneral Policy\n\nThe Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation (RIEDC) recognizes that the safety of their employees and the general public is one of their greatest responsibilities.  Therefore, RIEDC continues to develop maintenance, inspection, training, and review programs to reduce the likelihood, or effects of, accidents within their facilities.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nRIEDC operates the Quonset Point Wastewater Treatment Facility at North Kingstown, Rhode Island.  Chlorine is the only substance at this facility that is considered a \"Regulated Substance\" by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Chlorine is classified as a toxic gas, which, when improperly handled, may affect the health of the workers or the surrounding community and environment.\n\nUnder normal operating conditions, chlorine gas is mixed with potable water to create a chlorinated water solution for disinfecting the plant effluent.  This solution is formed with a vacuum type chlorination system, which causes gaseous chlorine to flow from one-ton cylinders, through a vacuum regulator, a chlorinator, and through an ejector.  The chlorinator controls the gas flow rate and the ejector creates the vacuum and is the site where the chlorine gas is mixed into the potable water to form the chlorine solution.  The chlorine is under a vacuum between the vacuum regulator and the ejector.  \n\nControl of plant effluent disinfection is accomplished with an automatic chlorine feed system.  This system utilizes a chlorine residual analyzer and plant effluent flow signals to continuously adjust the chlorine feed rate.\n\nThe chlorine is stored in two 2,000-pound chlorine storage cylinders, which are located within an enclosed chlorine building.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nRIEDC has determined a worst-case scenario related to the release of chlorine. During a worst-case release, the chlorine gas would escape"

      "SummaryText": " from one (1) 2,000-pound chlorine cylinder at a rate of 200 lbs./min. over a 10 minute period.  Due to the flat and relatively unobstructed terrain, a worst-case release from the chlorination process would affect any public or environmental receptor within a 3.0 mile radius of the facility, which includes portions of North Kingstown and Jamestown, RI.  Outside this radius, the chlorine gas concentration falls below the 0.0087 mg/l level that has been established by the EPA as the toxic endpoint.   Within the affected area, public receptors including schools, residences, industrial facilities, commercial/office areas, recreation areas, and boats could be exposed to concentrations above the threshold exposure limit.  There are no national or state parks, forests, or wildlife refuges within the 3-mile radius.  The ocean, however is within the 3-mile radius.  The affected residential population is approximately 12,200 persons. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nRIEDC has also determined an alternative release scenario.  During the alternative release, chlorine gas would escape as the result of a failure of the vacuum regulator, which could result in the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine at a rate of 37 pounds/minute for 54 minutes.  The affected area would be limited to 0.3 miles.  Public receptors, including industrial facilities and commercial/office areas, would be affected. The ocean is the only environmental receptor that could be affected.  No residential population would be affected. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nRIEDC recognizes that prevention is an essential element in reducing accidents within their facility.  The plan includes the following:\n\nSafety System - A leak sensor inthe chlorine cylinder storage room and in the chlorinator room actuates the plant alarm system to alert personnel that a leak has occurred.\n\nSelf-contained air packs are located at the Chlorine Building and in the operations Building.  Personnel entering an area with a "

Additionally, a Chlorine Institute Kit \"B\" for repairing cylinder leaks is located in the Chlorine Building.\n\nOperations - Plant personnel use standard procedures for unloading chlorine cylinders from the delivery truck, for disconnection a spent cylinder, and for connecting up a fresh cylinder.  The procedures includeusing new tubing each time a fresh cylinder is connected to a vacuum regulator, using new lead washers for the tubing connections, and testing all connections for leaks with ammonia.\n\nTraining - By August 1, 19999 the plant will implement a chlorine training program for new employees and will implement periodic refresher training for existing employees.  Training will cover safe handling practices, preventive maintenance, and emergency response procedures for handling chlorine leaks.  The training program will comply with 40 CFR 68.54.\n\nPreventive Maintenance - Preventive maintenance on the chlorine system components that handle chlorine gas - mainly the vacuum regulators and the chlorinators - is handled by the component manufacturer through a service contract.  The manufacturer services the equipment quarterly.  Plant personnel maintain the chlorine ejectors on a regular basis.  By August 1, 1999, the plant will develop and implement a written preventive maintenance program which will comply with 40 CFR 68.56.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo known significant spills or leaks have occurred at the Quonset Point Wastewater Treatment Plant that have resulted in on- or-off-site consequences during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response plan has been developed.  An emergency coordinator and two alternative individuals have been identified. The emergency coordinator is responsible for determining if an emergency situation warrants a planned evacuation and implementation of this plan.\n\nThe plan includes information related to management of the plan, evacuation of employees, respons"

(The detector control and transmitter units would be installed in the Sampler Room.)\n7 Install a panic button connected to an alarm in the chlorine Sampling Room for the safety of the person performing sampling.  Also install a phone in the Sampling Room.\n7 Install a window, a light, or some other means of identifying when personnel are in the sampling room.\n7 Install a windsock, or other wind directional device, to allow employees to identify the prevailing wind direction in case of an accidental release.\n7 Connect the chlorine leak alarm signals from the detector unit in the sampler room to the alarm panel in the main office so that the personnel can acknowledge the exact loca"
