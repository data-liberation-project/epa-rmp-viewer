              "Description": "System Description\n\nThe chlorination system consistes of two 2000-pound liquid chlorine cylinders, a cylinder weigh scale, two chlorinators containing gas control valves and rotameters,  two chloirne ejectors, and  piping.  The vacuum regulators are located approximately 1 foot away from the cylinders and are connected to the cylinders with loosely coiled copper tubing.\n\nSafety Systems\n\nFor safety, all components of the system downstream of the vacuum regulators operate under vacuum, such that any leakage will be into, rather than out of, the components.  The vacuum is created by the ejectors.  If pressureized chlorine passes by the vacuum valve at the inlet of the regulator, the regulator diverts the chlorine through a vent line to outside of the Chlorine Building.\n\nThe tubing between the vacuum regulators and the cylinders is under pressure.  This tubing has been made as short as possible to minimize leak hazards.\n\nExhaust fans in the cylinder storage room and in the chlorinator room are interlocked with the room's light switches. The fans will run when the lights are turned on.  This interlock evacuates leaked chlorine from the rooms to reduce chlorine hazards to perssonnel.\n\nA leak sensor in each room actuates the plant alarm system to alert personnel that a leak has occurred.\n\nSelf-contained air packs are located at the Chlorine Building and in the Operations Building.  Personnel entering an area with a chlorine leak will use these air packs.  Additionally, a Chlorine Institute Kit \"B\" for repairing cylinder leaks is located in the Chlorine Building.\n\nOperations\n\nPlant personnel use standard procedures for unloading chlorine cylinders from the delivery truck, for disconnecting a spent cylinder, and for connecting up a fresh cylinder.  The procedures include using new tubing each time a fresh cylinder is connected to a vacuum regulator, using new lead washers for the tubing connections, and testing all connections for leaks with ammonia.\n\nWhile the standard operating procedures are not in formal written form, the chlorine system operating  and safety procedures are written in the plant's operation and maintenance manual.  By August 1, 1999, the plant will have step-by-step written standard operating procedures for the chlorination system.  These procedures will comply with 40 CFR 68.52.\n\nTraining\n\nBy August 1, 1999 the plant will implement a chlorine training program for new employees and will implement periodic refresher training for existing employees.  Training will cover safe handling practices, preventive maintenance, and emergency response procedures for handling chlorine leaks.  The training program will comply with 40 CFR 68.54.\n\nPreventive Maintenance\n\nPreventive maintenance on the chlorine systme components that handle chlorine gas - mainly the vacuum regulators and the chlorinators - is handled by the component manufacturer through a service contract.  The manufacturer services the equipment quarterly.  Plant personnel maintain the chlorine ejectors on a regular basis.  By August 1, 1999, the plant will develop and implement a written preventive maintenance program which will comply with 40 CFR 68.56.",

Therefore, RIEDC continues to develop maintenance, inspection, training, and review programs to reduce the likelihood, or effects of, accidents within their facilities.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nRIEDC operates the Quonset Point Wastewater Treatment Facility at North Kingstown, Rhode Island.  Chlorine is the only substance at this facility that is considered a \"Regulated Substance\" by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Chlorine is classified as a toxic gas, which, when improperly handled, may affect the health of the workers or the surrounding community and environment.\n\nUnder normal operating conditions, chlorine gas is mixed with potable water to create a chlorinated water solution for disinfecting the plant effluent.  This solution is formed with a vacuum type chlorination system, which causes gaseous chlorine to flow from one-ton cylinders, through a vacuum regulator, a chlorinator, and through an ejector.  The chlorinator controls the gas flow rate and the ejector creates the vacuum and is the site where the chlorine gas is mixed into the potable water to form the chlorine solution.  The chlorine is under a vacuum between the vacuum regulator and the ejector.  \n\nControl of plant effluent disinfection is accomplished with an automatic chlorine feed system.  This system utilizes a chlorine residual analyzer and plant effluent flow signals to continuously adjust the chlorine feed rate.\n\nThe chlorine is stored in two 2,000-pound chlorine storage cylinders, which are located within an enclosed chlorine building.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nRIEDC has determined a worst-case scenario related to the release of chlorine. During a worst-case release, the chlorine gas would escape"

      "SummaryText": " from one (1) 2,000-pound chlorine cylinder at a rate of 200 lbs./min. over a 10 minute period.  Due to the flat and relatively unobstructed terrain, a worst-case release from the chlorination process would affect any public or environmental receptor within a 3.0 mile radius of the facility, which includes portions of North Kingstown and Jamestown, RI.  Outside this radius, the chlorine gas concentration falls below the 0.0087 mg/l level that has been established by the EPA as the toxic endpoint.   Within the affected area, public receptors including schools, residences, industrial facilities, commercial/office areas, recreation areas, and boats could be exposed to concentrations above the threshold exposure limit.  There are no national or state parks, forests, or wildlife refuges within the 3-mile radius.  The ocean, however is within the 3-mile radius.  The affected residential population is approximately 12,200 persons. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nRIEDC has also determined an alternative release scenario.  During the alternative release, chlorine gas would escape as the result of a failure of the vacuum regulator, which could result in the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine at a rate of 37 pounds/minute for 54 minutes.  The affected area would be limited to 0.3 miles.  Public receptors, including industrial facilities and commercial/office areas, would be affected. The ocean is the only environmental receptor that could be affected.  No residential population would be affected. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nRIEDC recognizes that prevention is an essential element in reducing accidents within their facility.  The plan includes the following:\n\nSafety System - A leak sensor inthe chlorine cylinder storage room and in the chlorinator room actuates the plant alarm system to alert personnel that a leak has occurred.\n\nSelf-contained air packs are located at the Chlorine Building and in the operations Building.
