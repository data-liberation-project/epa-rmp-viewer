      "SummaryText": "This RMP pertains to the Three Rivers Energy (TRE) facility located in Coshocton, Coshocton County, Ohio.  TRE produces fuel grade ethanol from corn starch.  This executive summary is structured from the requirements specified in 40 CFR 68.155.  The following paragraphs A through F intend to specifically address the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (f) in 40 CFR 68.155.\n\nA)\t It is the policy of TRE to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to prevent an explosion, fire, and/or a release of flammable liquids.  A secondary objective is to minimize potential impacts to TRE employees, the public, and the environment in the unlikely event of a release.  TRE plans to accomplish these objectives by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining an appropriate preventative program for the equipment, providing proper training to TRE employees, hiring reputable qualified contractors, and coordinating emergency response and planning activities with local emergency management services.\n\nB)\tTRE is a fuel grade ethanol production facility.  This RMP submittal includes one process for the denaturant (a flammable liquid) storage and use at the TRE facility.  Denaturant (natural gasoline) is used to render the produced ethanol unfit for human consumption.  The denaturant is a flammable liquid mixture containing regulated substances, pentane and butane.  The denaturant is received at the facility from tanker trucks and is stored in an atmospheric above ground storage tank prior to being used to render the produced alcohol unfit for human consumption.  The denatured ethanol is stored in one of two atmospheric above ground storage tanks prior to being shipped offsite.  \n\nC)\tWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios were conducted for denaturant storage and use process.  These release scenarios were conducted in accordance with the requirements in 40 CFR Part 68 using EPA"
