Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Covanta Mendota, L.P. facility handles anhydrous ammonia in a single 20,000 gallon tank.   Ammonia is a hazardous material subject to Risk Management Planning and Process Safety Management. The properties of ammonia make it necessary to ensure mechanical integrity of the tank, piping and associated equipment; and to observe safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCovanta Mendota is a 28 megawatt (MW), biomass-fired, electrical power generating facility.  The plant burns agricultural, wood fuels, and other crop wastes in a fluidized bed boiler to generate high pressure steam which drives a turbine generator.  Ammonia vapor is used at the plant to control nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions in the boiler flue gas.  Anhydrous ammonia is received at the plant via a supplier's delivery vehicle and stored in a single 20,000 gallon capacity tank.  There is a daily maximum of 88,000 lbs of ammonia at the facility.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release was modeled May 31, 2002 and was reviewed in May 2004 and January 2009.  Results are available on request\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario was modeled May 31, 2002 and was reviewed in May 2004 and January 2009.  Results are available on request\n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occu"

      "SummaryText": "r; and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia system and the training provided to the ammonia system operators.\n\n3d. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing,  and maintenance of the ammonia system and its related equipment and components. Two windsocks are used to indicate wind direction and employees are trained to meet in an upwind area in the event of emergency.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility\u00c2\u00bfs main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases occurred within the last five years\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the local Fire Department and other agency emergency response teams at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  Fresno County can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 5 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nCommitments made under the State of California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program and  related activities will continue to be implemented.  Current applicable codes and regulations are  reviewed on a periodic basis t"
