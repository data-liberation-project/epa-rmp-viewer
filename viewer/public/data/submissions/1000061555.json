      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe Entegris facility in Danbury, Connecticut produces Safe Delivery Source&reg; (SDS)&reg; systems to enable safe use of specialty gases, including arsine in the semiconductor industry.  The SDS systems contain the specialty gases on absorbent carbon-based media at sub-atmospheric pressures (< 14.7 psia) in small (0.41 to 6.6 liter) steel cylinders. The regulated processes are simply: \n\n\n\n1.    The transfer of arsine gas from high pressure source cylinders to the SDS cylinders and \n\n2.    The storage of the high pressure supply source cylinders and filled and empty SDS cylinders.  \n\n\n\nNo chemical mixing or chemical reactions occur in the process.  Once the gas is transferred to the SDS, it is stored in an inherently safe manner because even if the SDS cylinder were ruptured, the gas would remain on the absorbent media.  The end user must use a vacuum to withdraw the gas from SDS cylinder for use.  \n\n\n\nRMP AND PSM THRESHOLDS\n\n\n\nThe RMP threshold for arsine (1000 pounds) will be triggered because Entegris will be adding additional SDS cylinder storage at the location facility in early 2017.  The OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) threshold for arsine (100 pounds) had been triggered previously, so Entegris already has a PSM program in place.  The PSM program was reviewed as part of the RMP process and recently updated by re-organizing the PSM material making it more readily accessible.  The SDS production and storage process falls within Program 3 of the RMP because the site is subject to PSM and has an offsite public receptor within the worst case scenario release assessment model.  \n\n\n\nARSINE STORAGE AND USE\n\n\n\nThe facility stores a maximum of seven, 60-pound high pressure steel source cylinders of arsine used to fill the SDS which are stored in a locked hazardous materials storage building that is controlled by an electronic card reader to limit access to trained and authorized personnel.  This area contains gas sensors (Honeywell V"

The high pressure source cylinders arrive with protective steel valve caps that protect the cylinder valves from impact. The source cylinders are checked for leaks upon arrival with portable gas detection equipment.  The high pressure source cylinders contain pneumatic valves which cannot be opened by hand without a special tool. These valves require a pneumatic pressure of 80 psig to open and allow gas to flow from them. In addition the cylinder valve outlet fitting also comes with a sealed protective cap, which would prevent gas flow from the source cylinder if the valve were inadvertently opened. The source cylinder protective valve caps are not removed until the cylinders have been secured inside the gas cabinet and it is time to connect the source cylinder valves to the gas cabinet manifold. The high pressure cylinders are equipped with reduced flow orifices (RFOs) of 0.040 inches which limit the flow of gas from the cylinder when the valve is opened for use.  When placed in service in the gas cabinet, the pneumatic source gas cylinder valve will automatically close at the detection of a gas leak or any building evacuation or fire alarm. The gas cabinet and other related process equipment is ventilated to an emergency release rooftop scrubber (a redundant safety device) which will prevent or minimize a release into the atmosphere outside the building.  The remaining storage of arsine is in the sub-atmospheric pressure SDS cylinders.  \n\n\n\nIn the event a gas sensor alarm is triggered, the area is evacuated and the Entegris Emergency Response Team (ERT) responds wearing self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) to determine and remedy the source of the alarm.  If a SDS cylinder or high-pressure cylinder is found to be leaking, the ERT contains it in a gas-tight \"coffin\" which is safely removed from the facility."

The \"Worst Case Release\" scenario was based on a catastrophic release of the largest container at the facility, the 60 pound high pressure arsine source cylinder.  The following offsite consequence analysis parameters were used, as dictated by 40 CFR 68.22.  \n\n\n\n?    Release of entire contents of 60 pound source cylinder in a 10 minute period for a release rate of 6 pound/minute;\n\n?    Wind Speed of 1.5 meters per second\n\n?    Class F atmospheric stability \n\n?    Ground level release\n\n?    Air temperature of 77 degrees F\n\n?    Urban surroundings\n\n\n\nUsing the above parameters, the affected area was computed to encompass a 1.6 mile radius around the facility.  \n\n\n\nALTERATIVE SCENARIO MODEL - TOXICS\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario is intended to be a more likely scenario than a sudden catastrophic release of the largest container.  For this scenario, it was assumed that one of the high pressure arsine source cylinders was left wide open.  The flow rate would be based on the flow through the 0.040\" RFO.  Entegris has computed this to be 93.5 liters per minute  (=3.302 cubic feet per minute) with a density of 0.2 pounds per cubic foot  which equals 0.66 pounds/minute.  Entegris has reported that it would take the ERT much less than 60 minutes to don SCBA and contain such a leak from a high pressure source cylinder.  So, the alternative scenario was to assume a release rate of 0.66 pounds per minute for a period of 60 minutes.  \n\n\n\nOther assumptions were based on the default parameters for an alternative scenario in RMP*Comp.  These include:\n\n\n\n?    Wind Speed of 3 meters per second\n\n?    Class D atmospheric stability \n\n?    Ground level release\n\n?    Air temperature of 77 degrees F\n\n?    Urban surroundings\n\n\n\nUsing RMP*comp, this resulted in a potentially affected area within a 0.2 mile radius around the g"

The area was entirely light industrial and commercial, with no residences, schools, prisons, or hospitals in that radius.  The only public receptors are an industrial/office area a small shopping center containing a grocery store and other retail and service establishments in the alternative scenario area.  \n\n\n\nThe 1.6 mile radius contained a larger portion of Danbury and a portion of Bethel, Connecticut, but would only be affected under a very unusual circumstance such as the entire head of the source cylinder being sheared off.  Based on CAMEO Marplot software, the area contains a residential population of 19,000.  It also contains the following resources:\n\n\n\n?    Schools\n\n?    Recreation Area\n\n?    Hospital\n\n?    Commercial, office and industrial areas\n\n\n\nIt is not expected that either scenario would occur, and Entegris's five year history has no significant releases outside their facility and no injuries.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\n\n\nEntegris has completed, and recently updated a PHA using a \"What if\" technique that includes.  This organized and systematic effort identified more than 140 potential hazards and focused on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process.  It was conducted by engineers, scientists and technicians familiar with the process and equipment.  \n\n\n\nSome of the key hazards and the way in which they are mitigated are identified in the excerpts below:\n\n\n\n?

All high pressure source cylinders are immediately checked for leaks with portable gas detection equipment when source cylinders arrive from the vendor in shipping and receiving. The high pressure source cylinders are then moved out of Receiving and into the outdoor Hazmat shed to minimize any potential impact to the source cylinders by a forklift in Shipping and Receiving. High pressure source cylinders arrive with protective steel valve caps that protect the cylinder valves from impact. The high pressure source cylinders contain pneumatic valves which cannot be opened by hand without a special tool.

However if this situation does occur, personnel will immediately evacuate the area and leave the building and activate the building evacuation alarm as they leave.
