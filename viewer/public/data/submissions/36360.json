              "Description": "The St. Cloud Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTF) falls under the EPA RMP 40 CFR 68 and OSHA PSM 29 CFR 1910.100 regulations for having an inventory on-site of chlorine gas over the threshold quanity of 2,500-lbs.  In lieu of these regulations, the St. Cloud WWTF has developed a prevention program to eliminate injury and/or death to the St. Cloud WWTF employees and the public in case of an accidental release.  Section 1: Introduction, Purpose and Management System - is to ensure that everyone who plays a part in the RMProgram understands their roles and responsibilities and those responsibilities are assigned for all program elements.  Responsibilities for each program element are assigned to specific St. Cloud WWTF employees.  Section 2: Employee Participation Plan, is to define how employees will be involved in the RMProgram.  The St. Cloud WWTF will provide an overview of the RMProgram, provide access to all RMProgram information required to safely perform their duties and will provide procedures on how to obtain this information.  Designated employees are listed under each program element.  Section 3: Process Safety Information, is to provide process safety information pertaining to the hazards of sulfur dioxide and chlorine gas, the technology of the processes and the equipment used in these processes.  This is accomplished through annual right-to-know training.  Section 4: Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), describes how the St. Cloud WWTF will handle PHA to identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas hazards.  The overall purpose of a PHA is to prevent or minimize the effects of an accidental chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  Section 5: Operation Procedures, is to ensure that the St. Cloud WWTF maintains up to date and accurate written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) that provide clear instruction for all covered processes.  SOP's for changing a cylinder, response to a leak while changing a cylinder, loading and unloading a cyclinder are some of the procedures written in this section.  Section 6: Training, is to ensure that personnel working on or near chlorine and sulfur dioxide are adequately trained and understand the inherent process hazards and appropriate response and action to accidental chlorine release.  Section 7: Contractor Responsibility, is to ensure that only contractors with good health and safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the chlorine system.  Employer and contractor responsibilities are assigned.  Section 8: Pre-startup Safety Review, is to ensure safe operation of new and modified regulated processes.  For new capital construction projects, the Project Engineer will conduct the pre-startup safety review, for modifications to the existing system, the Wastewater Services Manager is assigned to conduct the pre-startup safety review.  Section 9: Mechanical Integrity, is to establish, implement and maintain an ongoing mechanical integrity that ensures process equipment and instrumentation to minimize the risk of an accidental chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas release.  The Wastewater Services Manager will determine which equipment in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process is covered, establish written maintainence procedures, train maintenance personnel, perform inspections and test on process equipment and correct equipment deficiencies.  Section 10: Hot Work Permit, is to ensure that a hot work permit is issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the chlorination and sulfur dioxide system.  The Wastewater Services Manager and all maintenance personnel are responsible for implementing this hot work permit procedure.  Section 11: Managing Change, is to make sure any system changes are properly reviewed against the original system specifications and be accomplished safely.  Section 12: Incident Investigation, is to document and investigate all incidents including \"near misses\" involving the release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas to determine cause(s) and in order to prevent reoccurence.  The Wastewater Services Manager and the Water Quality Coordinator are responsible to initiate and follow-through the incident investigation.  Section 13: Emergency Response Plan, is to establish a procedure for the timely mitigation of hazardous material incidents within the property of the St. Cloud WWTF.  ERP training will be conducted for any new employee and will be reviewed every 3 years for all other employees.  Section 14: Compliance Audits, is to ensure audits are performed to evaluate the St. Cloud WWTF's process safety and risk management programs.  The audit will identify recommendations to address program deficiencies.",

Presently the average daily flow is 10-MGD, design flow is 13-MGD.\n\n\n\nThe St. Cloud WWTF uses chlorine to disinfect the discharge effluent to the Mississippi River.  Chlorine is also used for process control measures.  The St. Cloud WWTF uses sulfur dioxide to eliminate the chlorine residual of the effluent before it reaches the Mississippi River.  The EPA rule is applicable to the St. Cloud WWTF because the maximum inventory for chlorine gas is greater than the 2,500-lbs EPA RMP threshold and the OSHA PSM rule because the maximum inventory for sulfur dioxide is greater than the 500-lb threshold.  The maximum amount of chlorine gas stored on-site is 18,000-lbs.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide gas stored on-site is 8,000-lbs.\n\n\n\nA requirement of the RMP is a Hazard Assessment of the potential impacts of a worst-case and alternate release scenarios.  An assessment of these scenarios is included with the submittal.  There have been no reportable accidents at the St. Cloud WWTF in the last five years.\n\n\n\nActive administrative and mitigation control measures are utilized to prevent accidental release.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detectors are in place and checked weekly.  An audible alarm will sound if chlorine gas or sulfur dioxide gas is detected.  An accidental release of chlorine gas or sulfur dioxide gas would take place in an enclosed building, slowing the release rate and decreasing the distance of travel.  \n\n\n\nThe goa"

      "SummaryText": "l of the Prevention Program is to reduce the risk of an accidental release of chlorine gas and prevent injury to the public and WWTF employees.  This is accomplished by specifying responsibilities and outlining safety procedures that will prevent and/or contain a chlorine gas release.\n\n\n\nThe St. Cloud WWTF has an Emergency Action Plan to comply with Federal Regulations 40 CFR 1910.38(a).\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Risk Management Plan, the St. Cloud WWTF has a written procedure to respond to hazardous materials spills including chlorine gas.  The St. Cloud WWTF uses a zone system to control and identify the areas of a hazardous material spill.  The zone system assists the Fire and Police Departments with areas of evacuation and hazardous materials containment.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is to ensure the safety and well being of the users of the water system and St. Cloud Public Utilities employees during times of emergency operations.  The plan identifies necessary administrative and employee actions during emergencies.  It does not cover all possible crisis or emergencies that may occur, but the actions indicated in the plan will assist in any type of emergency. \n\n\n\nElements addressed in the EAP include escape procedures and exit routes, critical plant operations, accounting for employees, rescue and medical duties, reporting emergencies, alarm systems and notification of emergencies and types of evacuations.\n\n\n\nThe Public Utilities Administration is committed to safety by providing annual right to know training, bloodborne pathogen training, lock out - tag out and confined space entry procedures.  Administration supports regular Hazard Control Meetings and Monthly City Safety Committee Meetings and provides personal protection equipment to all employees.  The City of St. Cloud will continue to make safety a high priority and is committed to employee training and improving the current safety policies and programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
