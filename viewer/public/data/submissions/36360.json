Presently the average daily flow is 10-MGD, design flow is 13-MGD.\r\n\r\nThe St. Cloud WWTF uses chlorine to disinfect the discharge effluent to the Mississippi River.  Chlorine is also used for process control measures.  The St. Cloud WWTF uses sulfur dioxide to eliminate the chlorine residual of the effluent before it reaches the Mississippi River.  The EPA rule is applicable to the St. Cloud WWTF because the maximum inventory for chlorine gas is greater than the 2,500-lbs EPA RMP threshold and the OSHA PSM rule because the maximum inventory for sulfur dioxide is greater than the 500-lb threshold.  The maximum amount of chlorine gas stored on-site is 18,000-lbs.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide gas stored on-site is 8,000-lbs.\r\n\r\nA requirement of the RMP is a Hazard Assessment of the potential impacts of a worst-case and alternate release scenarios.  An assessment of these scenarios is included with the submittal.  There have been no reportable accidents at the St. Cloud WWTF in the last five years.\r\n\r\nActive administrative and mitigation control measures are utilized to prevent accidental release.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detectors are in place and checked weekly.  An audible alarm will sound if chlorine gas or sulfur dioxide gas is detected.  An accidental release of chlorine gas or sulfur dioxide gas would take place in an enclosed building, slowing the release rate and decreasing the distance of travel.  \r\n\r\nThe goa"

      "SummaryText": "l of the Prevention Program is to reduce the risk of an accidental release of chlorine gas and prevent injury to the public and WWTF employees.  This is accomplished by specifying responsibilities and outlining safety procedures that will prevent and/or contain a chlorine gas release.\r\n\r\nThe St. Cloud WWTF has an Emergency Action Plan to comply with Federal Regulations 40 CFR 1910.38(a).\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Risk Management Plan, the St. Cloud WWTF has a written procedure to respond to hazardous materials spills including chlorine gas.  The St. Cloud WWTF uses a zone system to control and identify the areas of a hazardous material spill.  The zone system assists the Fire and Police Departments with areas of evacuation and hazardous materials containment.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is to ensure the safety and well being of the users of the water system and St. Cloud Public Utilities employees during times of emergency operations.  The plan identifies necessary administrative and employee actions during emergencies.  It does not cover all possible crisis or emergencies that may occur, but the actions indicated in the plan will assist in any type of emergency. \r\n\r\nElements addressed in the EAP include escape procedures and exit routes, critical plant operations, accounting for employees, rescue and medical duties, reporting emergencies, alarm systems and notification of emergencies and types of evacuations.\r\n\r\nThe Public Utilities Administration is committed to safety by providing annual right to know training, bloodborne pathogen training, lock out - tag out and confined space entry procedures.  Administration supports regular Hazard Control Meetings and Monthly City Safety Committee Meetings and provides personal protection equipment to all employees.  The City of St. Cloud will continue to make safety a high priority and is committed to employee training and improving the current safety policies and programs."
