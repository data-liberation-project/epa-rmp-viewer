      "SummaryText": "1. Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nWinn-Dixie Logistics, Inc. (Winn-Dixie) requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Winn-Dixie?s corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.  Winn-Dixie is resubmitting this revised RMP to reflect an addition of a perishable facility with an ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Dairy and Distribution Center, owned and operated by Winn-Dixie Logistics, Inc., are located at 3925 Highway 190 West in Hammond, Louisiana.  The Dairy facility manufactures milk, juice, and bottled water for distribution to the Winn-Dixie Supermarkets. The Distribution Center consists of areas for dry, cooler, and freezer storage of perishable and non-perishable items for distribution to the Winn-Dixie Supermarkets.\n\nThe Dairy has an ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 pound RMP threshold quantity. The majority of the process equipment, including the High Pressure receiver (HPR) is located inside the building.\n\nThe Distribution Center has two separate ammonia refrigeration systems which exceed the 10,000 pound RMP threshold quantity.  The HPRs are both located inside machine rooms.   The HPR in the perishable warehouse is largest vessel at the facility and is therefore the subject of the worst case scenario.  \n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP*Comp software supplied by the EPA was utilized to provide endpoint distances for all scenarios in this submittal. \n\nThe worst case release scenario consists of the rupture of the HPR vessel at the perishable facility, resulting in the release of 15,758 pounds of ammonia into the machine room over a 10"

      "SummaryText": "-minute period.  Since the ammonia is released into the machine room, the passive mitigation of the building would only allow a release rate of 504 pounds/minute to the atmosphere.  Under worst case weather conditions the ammonia gas could travel 1.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L).\n\nSince there are three separate processes onsite, three alternative cases were developed.  The first scenario consists of a leak from the HPR liquid supply line inside the machine room at the dairy. This results in a leak to the atmosphere of 212 pounds/minute. Such a leak could occur from worker/human error or corrosion of the pipe.  Under normally expected weather conditions, taking into consideration the automatic pressure cutoff system, and the passive mitigation provided by the building, the ammonia gas could travel 0.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L.)\n\nThe second alternative release scenario involves a leak in liquid supply line to the HPR in the Freezer facility. Although unlikely, this could also occur due to operator error or pipe corrosion. Considering expected weather conditions, automatic shutoff capabilities of the process, and that the release would occur inside the machine room, the leak rate to the atmosphere would be 144 pounds/minute. RMP*Comp returns an offsite distance of  0.2 miles before the ammonia disperses to a point where it no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L.)\n\nThe third alternative scenario consists of a leak from the HPR liquid supply line inside the machine room at the perishable facility. This results in a leak to the atmosphere of 54 pounds/minute. Such a leak could occur from worker/human error or corrosion of the pipe.  Under normally expected weather conditions, taking into consideration the a"

Prevention Program\n\nAll three processes exceed the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and are therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places them in RMP program 3 level.  Winn-Dixie uses its PSM program as the required program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nWinn-Dixie has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This ensures that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, Winn-Dixie also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include operation of safety devices.  These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout, Confined Space Entry, and Hot Work Permit are reviewed and updated when necessary to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correc"

These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Winn-Dixie refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff also performed a PHA of each of these processes.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Auditing, and Incident Investigation are also part of the programs to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Programs receive full support of facility management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Winn-Dixie facilities have had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Hammond facility has an Integrated Contingency Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38 and paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120, including onsite emergency response capability.  In the event of an emergency, evacuation procedures are initiated and the Winn-Dixie Hazardous Materials Response Team handles releases.  The local Fire Department and its Hazardous Materials Response Team will be notified for back-up.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Louisiana State Warning Point at 1-(504) 925-6595."
