      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u00c2\u00bf OCEAN SPRAY CRANBERRIES, INC.\n\nOcean Spray Cranberries, Incorporated (Ocean Spray) in Kenosha, Wisconsin processes cranberries into juice and sauce products.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of all the products within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  Each refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves.  There are two ammonia systems within the facility.  One system (Main System) was estimated to hold approximately 11,000 pounds of ammonia, while the other system (Flex/Aseptic System) was estimated to hold approximately 9,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \n Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Plan (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.  \n                                                                                                                                         \nThe calculated inventory of the Main system indicates it could be charged with over 10,000-pounds of ammonia. The calculated inventory of the Flex/Aseptic system indicates under 10,000-pounds of an ammonia charge.  The RMP and PSM rules require facilities to a"

      "SummaryText": "ddress only those processes that contain over the 10,000 pound threshold of ammonia unless a release of one process could result in a release from the other, or an external event to the processes (such as a fire or explosion) could have the potential to release ammonia from multiple containers.\n\nUnder most circumstances, a release from the Main system would not cause a release of the Flex/Aseptic system unless an external fire spreads from one vessel to the other.  Although there is a low likelihood that there would be a catastrophic fire that would engulf both processes, Ocean Spray has elected to include both systems in the RMP and PSM programs to ensure the safety of employees and surrounding areas. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n As a part of its PSM Program, Ocean Spray has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The programs include:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7Process Safety Information\n\u00c2\u00b7Process Hazard Analysis\n\u00c2\u00b7Operating Procedures\n\u00c2\u00b7Training\n\u00c2\u00b7Mechanical Integrity\n\u00c2\u00b7Management of Change\n\u00c2\u00b7Pre-startup Review\n\u00c2\u00b7Compliance Audits\n\u00c2\u00b7Incident Investigations\n\u00c2\u00b7Employee Participation\n\u00c2\u00b7Hot Work Permits\n\u00c2\u00b7Contractor Safety\n\nIn addition, Ocean Spray has installed a sophisticated system of ammonia sensors.  These sensors are capable of detecting releases of ammonia at low levels, and are connected to a computer which signals the location of a release so trained plant personnel can take immediate response actions.\n\nEmergency Response Information: \n As a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of action taken during an incident.  As a part of this emergency planning effort, a team of employees has received emergency response training and has been equipped to respond to ammonia releases.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the"
