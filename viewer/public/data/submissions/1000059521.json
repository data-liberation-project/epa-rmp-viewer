      "SummaryText": "Oiltanking Joliet, L.P. (Oiltanking Joliet) operates a marine terminal that stores chemicals including hydrocarbons/petroleum products, solvents, intermediates, and industrial products.  Operations occurring at Oiltanking Joliet are marine/overland vessel loading/unloading, storage, transportation, and distribution of chemicals.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations presented in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68), the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, require Oiltanking Joliet to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule because the quantities of ethylenediamine to be stored onsite exceed threshold quantities.\n\nThe RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA-approved chemical release prevention program. In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP covered facilities to update its Risk Management Program Plan (RMP Plan) within (6) months of an RMP reportable incident or every five (5) years, whichever comes first.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68, Oiltanking Joliet is submitting this initial RMP Plan.\n\nPotential offsite consequences of hypothetical Worst-Case Scenarios (WCS) and Alternative Releases Scenarios (ARS) were conducted using the EPA RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the worst case and alternative release scenarios\n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, worst-case and alternative release scenarios were generated for toxic releases of the chemical (ethylenediamine) that Oiltanking Joliet stores on-site above threshold levels.  Details regarding the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for Oiltanking Joliet are provided in the RMP Plan.\n\n"
