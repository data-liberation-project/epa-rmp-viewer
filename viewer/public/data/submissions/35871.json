The only RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\n\nThe refrigeration system(s) in this facility use anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThis facility follows a rigorous RMP & Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The program is also in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM & RMP programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan will be provided to the local LEPC for review.\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\nThis is a food processing facility. Ammonia (R-717) is used as the refrigerant to cool air and water which in turn cools food products. The refrigeration compressors are in the engine rooms and operate at various temperatures from +40\u00b0F down to -30\u00b0F. This refrigeration system is a liquid re-circulating system and is designed to operate with an overfeed-ratio of approximately 3:1 for some of the evaporative air units. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems contain six interconnected sub-systems:\n\n1.Low-temperature re-circulating evaporator system.\n2.High-temperature evaporator system .\n3.Thermosyphon oil cooling system.\n4.Condenser system.\n5.Compressor low-temperature system.\n6.Compressor high-temperature system.\n\nThe re-circulators and accumulators are pressure vessels.

Following is an overview.\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for all employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the Process Safety Management Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits. Community involvement is through coordination, cooperation, and pre-planning with the local Fire department and LEPC.\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the What-if technique.

The liquid-vapor mixture is returned to the vessels where the liquid is separated from the vapor. High pressure liquid is fed to some of the higher temperature evaporators. The low temperature compressors take the ammonia vapor from this vessel and compress it. This vessel has connection with the low temperature compressors (dry suction) and with the low-temperature evaporators (wet suction and pumped liquid).\n\nThe intercooler is a vertical pressure vessel. The low-stage booster-compressors discharge superheated vapor into this vessel. The superheated vapor bubbles up through liquid ammonia giving up its superheat and creating more vapor volume. Liquid ammonia for the low-temperature loads is fed into this vessel and is cooled to saturation temperature. The medium-temperature liquid is pumped from this vessel to the medium-temperature air units where thirty- percent of the liquid mass is evaporated. The liquid-vapor mixture is returned to this vessel where the liquid is separated from the vapor. The high-temperature liquid is pumped from this vessel to the cooler air units where thirty- percent of the liquid mass is evaporated.

High-pressure ammonia-vapor flows from the high-stage compressors to the evaporative condenser where heat is removed. The vapor is condensed into a high-pressure liquid using air and water flowing over the outside of the condensing pipe coils. High-pressure liquid from the condenser is drained to the thermosyphon pilot-receiver and overflows to the controlled-pressure receiver. The saturated condensing temperature is 95\u00b0F (181 PSIG). The condenser has connections with the compressor discharge piping, the thermosyphon pilot-receiver, and the purger.\n\nThe ammonia piping and valves in the system are labeled. The identification system is recognized by IIAR. P&ID prints are available for review. Pipe, fittings, and connections specifications for ammonia refrigeration systems shall meet or exceed ASME/ANSI B31.5 specifications.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The location of the ammonia vessels are outside the building. The emergency ventilation discharges the engine room air through the roof, which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThe hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the release scenarios are based on the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.

Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even replacement in kind) be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team.
