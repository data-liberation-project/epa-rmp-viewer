This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending System including the associated piping and one 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel. KMLT owns the real property associated with the Butane Blending System. Energy Transfer owns all the equipment associated with the Butane Blending System. Energy Transfer and KMLT each have operational responsibilities for the Butane Blending System. Energy Transfer controls and monitors all butane blending operations remotely from its control center located near Houston, Texas, conducts all maintenance activities, and schedules the delivery of butane trucks. \n\n\n\nKMLT oversees the unloading of butane trucks into the storage vessel and conducts routine visual inspections.\n\n\n\nEnergy Transfer constructed the Butane Blending System in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) No. 58 (2017 Edition) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage. Energy Transfer designed, constructed, and maintains the Butane Blending System in accordance with NFPA No. 58 and the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations.\n\n\n\nIt is the Parties' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes. If an emergency were to occur, it is the Parties' policy to notify the Forest View Fire Department as well as Cook County Emergency Management Agency. Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services and MacNeal Hospital which is the nearest full service hospital/emergency department.\n\n\n\nThe Argo Harlem Terminal Butane Blending System worst-case scenario is the failure of the System's 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel which equates to 250,000 pounds of butane resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The System's alternate (potential off-site impact) release scenario is a pipe release from the truck offloading line (app"

This facility has not had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Butane Blending System, it is the Parties' policy to initially contact the owner of the equipment - Energy Transfer and the local fire department. The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the local fire department. The Forest View Fire Department personnel have been invited to participate in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\n\n\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (approximately 76% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices. Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this \"stationary source\" as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection.\n\n\n\nThe Parties actively seek employee input on process safety improvements. Additionally, the Forest View Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills.\n\nAdditional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
