For example, municipal and industrial water treatment facilities in the region rely on Hawkins for water disinfectants and other treatment products,equipment and expertise.\n\n\n\nHawkins, Inc. is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with branches that meet local needs in eight neighboring states. The company's primary business is to repackage, custom-blend and distribute products for the water disinfection, pharmaceutical, food, computer and other industries.\n\n\n\nHawkins has prepared and filed a Risk Management Plan for its Memphis, Tennessee facility where its primary activity is to receive and distribute packaged products such as chlorine for use by individual customer facilities.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan that Hawkins staff has filed for this facility is a planning and prevention tool; it helps us to better identify hazards and communicate with others. Risk Management Plans are developed by facilities that have sufficient quantities of any of 140 hazardous materials on site; at this facility, we handle one of those materials.\n\n\n\nThe product covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility is Chlorine. Chlorine and bleach (sodium hypochlorite) are well-known and trusted disinfectants for drinking water, waste water, food processing equipment, swimming pools, etc.\n\n\n\nRisk Management\n\nHawkins provides products critical to meeting the region's public health and the manufacturing needs. Some of these products pose risks, which is why all Hawkins employees share a commitment to safety. Our safety policy states:\n\n\n\n\"Hawkins, Inc. recognizes its obligation to provide all employees with a safe and healthful workplace and to ensure that operations do not impact neighbors. The Company has provided, and will continue to provide,the human, physical and financial resources necessary to meet this objective. We expect all e"

Hawkins is a leader in national efforts to ensure safe handling of chemicals such as chlorine.\n\n\n\nReality is, however, that accidents can happen. That's why continually update mechanical safeguards and invest heavily in training for our employees and our customers.\n\n\n\nIn addition to our internal efforts, safety and emergency response planning also is coordinated with local and national officials, including the Memphis Fire Department.\n\n"
