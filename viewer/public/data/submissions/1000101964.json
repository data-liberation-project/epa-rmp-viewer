This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with both ammonia processes at the Blythe Energy Center facility.\n\nIt is the policy of Blythe Energy Center to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  If such a release does occur, all facility personnel are trained to assess and mitigate the effects of the release, and to evacuate to safe locations as appropriate.  The facility has coordinated emergency response policies and protocols with the Riverside County Fire Department & Cal-Fire, who can provide additional emergency response support.\n\nBlythe Energy Center employees conduct ongoing inspections, testing, and repairs of the critical items in the ammonia refrigeration system and the aqueous ammonia SCR DeNOx system.  Both systems are inspected on a daily basis, and continuously monitored by a fully trained plant operator stationed in the Control Room.  A record of the inspections and maintenance work performed on each system is maintained electronically on-site.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Blythe Energy Center facility is located at 385 N. Buck Boulevard, in Blythe, California.  The facility is approximately 0.6 miles north of Interstate 10 and 1.6 miles west of California Highway 78.

Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in a closed-loop refrigeration system that chills the air intake of the combustion turbine electrical generators, thereby increasing their efficiency.  Aqueous ammonia (29% solution) is used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) DeNOx system to reduce the NOx emission in the exhaust gas stream.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 55,000 pounds, and of 29% aqueous ammonia is 121,000 pounds (16,000 gallons).  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Chiller Refrigeration System:\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  The compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  A majority of the system equipment is located in the Ammonia Chiller Compressor Room.  The Condensers and the  Relief Valve Water Diffusion Tank are located outside the Chiller Compressor Room.\n\nThe process begins with high pressure liquid ammonia draining from the Evaporative Condensers to the SOC Receiver.  The SOC Receiver maintains a liquid reservoir for oil cooling of the Screw Compressors (5) via a modulating control valve on the outlet to the Flash Receiver.  The control valve is connected to the liquid level in the vessel, and allows excess liquid to flow to the Flash Receiver, where the pressure of the liquid ammonia is dropped.  The ammonia vapor produced by this partial drop in pressure is drawn from the Flash Receiver through the economizer suction port of the Compressors.  Liquid ammonia is fed from the Flash Receiver to the Pump Recirculator package.\n\nThe Pump Recirculation Package uses five (5) pumps to transfer the liquid ammonia to the Combustion Turbine Inlet Chilling System.  Two pumps feed each of the two Chillers, while the fifth pump is included for redundancy purposes.  At the Chillers, liquid ammonia partially boils as it absorbs heat from the air intake of the combustion turbine.  The resultant liquid/vapor mix returns to the Pu"

Each Compressor draws main suction (ammonia vapor) from the Pump Recirculation Package and economizer suction from the Flash Receiver.  Liquid injection oil cooling is provided by the SOC Receiver, and all Compressors discharge high pressure vapor to the Condensers which are located outside the Chiller Compressor Room.  The Evaporative Condensers reject latent heat from the high pressure ammonia vapor discharged from the compressors to the atmosphere, resulting in a phase change to high pressure liquid ammonia.  Sprayed water and air circulation by fans assists in the evaporative condensing process.  The resulting high pressure ammonia liquid drains to the SOC Receiver in the Chiller Compressor Room.\n\nAn automatic purger periodically purges the system of non-condensible gasses (i.e., air) collected in the condensers (high point of the system) to ensure continued safety and efficiency.\n\nAqueous Ammonia (29.5%) SCR DeNOx System:\n\nThe Aqueous Ammonia SCR DeNOx system is located outdoors on the property of Blythe Energy Center.  The facility uses 29% aqueous ammonia for Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to catalytically reduce boiler flue gas nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to elemental nitrogen and water.  Liquid (aqueous) ammonia is delivered by truck to the facility, and is stored in a double-walled tank which is located in a concrete berm containment area outside, to the west of the most southern heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).\n\nThe 29% aqueous ammonia is stored in a ~16,000 gallon double walled tank (Aqueous Ammonia Storage Tank) inside a concrete berm containment area located outdoors.

There are two SCR skids and two heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) at the facility, one SCR skid per HRSG.  Each skid contains three flow circuits for the mixing of hot flue gas, aqueous ammonia, and compressed air.  A vaporizer is located at the confluence of the three flow circuits.  On-skid piping includes a duplex \u0093Y\u0094-strainer, a flow control valve, and a block valve.\n\nThe 29% Aqueous Ammonia storage tank also supplies the Boiler pH Control Tote with ammonia via a connection point at HRSG 12 SCR Skid.  Manual operation of the valves is required for the batch fill process.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Blythe Energy Center ammonia refrigeration system and Aqueous Ammonia SCR DeNOx system have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These prevention programs cover those processes that handle anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia (29%).\n\nThe facility is manned with trained staff 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The system also incorporates a pressure relief line.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent through pressure relief valves to a common header which relieves to an atmospheric water diffusion tank (Relief Valve Water Tank) until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia vapor leak detectors are strategically located in the Chiller Compressor Room, in the inlet to the turbine, in the relief vent line to the Relief Valve Water Tank, and in the vicinity of the chiller coils.  The ammonia leak detectors installed in the Chiller Compressor Room and those located in the vicinity of the chiller coils will initiate the appropriate actions based on the following concentrations:\n\n-25 ppm:  Activates the local alarm in the Control Room, the emergency ventilation fan, and the exhaust treatment water pump.

Each switch is located outside next to each entry/exit door of the Chiller Compressor Room. \n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, etc.).
