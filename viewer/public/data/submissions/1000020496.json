We do not allow production goals or financial objectives to over-ride safety and environmental concerns.\n\nAlso, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to lead by example so that other companies, including vendors and suppliers, are similarly interested in protecting the health and safety of employees and safeguarding the environment.  We are committed to the spirit as well as the letter of our EHS policy and promote, throughout the organization, responsibility and accountability for strict compliance with that policy.  Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply with our EHS policy.\n\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impacts of our operations.  We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision making processes, including product research and development, packaging and new manufacturing methods.  Our continuous EHS improvement goals include pollution prevention and resource conservation.  We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics and policies similar to our own and we will give preference to suppliers that do so.\n\nWe encourage our employees, customers and the public to share with us their EHS concerns.  We continually talk with local authorities in communities in which we operate to share ideas about preventing incidents with materials we may use or store.\n\nAmmonia System\n\nAmmonia is used in the refrigeration system of the Brewery.

We have completed this report under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program in an effort to communicate our efforts to achieve a safe workplace.\n\nThe Brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper temperature during certain stages of the brewing process.  Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and the U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations.  The Brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely.  The Brewery has had no releases of ammonia that resulted in off-site injuries to people, harm to property off-site or damage to the environment since it opened in 1993. In 1996, the Brewery experienced one release which resulted in one minor injury to a contractor. In 2005 the brewery had a fire that resulted in a release of 19,548 pounds of ammonia which caused property damage on-site but no injuries to employees or the public.\n\nOur corporate environmental, health and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of the Brewery, employees and the public.  This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment.  These programs enable the Brewery to prevent the occurrence, or to minimize the consequences of, significant releases of ammonia.\n\nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and permits to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment.

This experience has helped bring about designs and operating plans that produce a safe system.  No ammonia releases from any of the company's Breweries have ever resulted in consequences off Brewery property.  The following elements have produced this safe operating record:\n\n-Process hazard analysis and review, including corrective action follow-up requirements;\n-Standard operating procedures that all operators of the refrigeration system must follow;\n-Formal operator training (80 hours minimum);\n-Preventative maintenance to ensure that the entire refrigeration system is mechanically sound;\n-Procedures to ensure that changes to the refrigeration system are managed so ammonia flow remains safe;\n-Safety review prior to start-up of new or modified equipment;\n-Audits of PSM and RMP programs;\n-Incident investigations to ensure that lessons are learned to prevent future incidents;\n-Employee involvement in risk reduction programs;\n-Contractor safety procedures are reviewed to ensure that outside contractors exercise the same safety consciousness as brewery empl"

The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29CFR 1910.38) and HAZWOPER (29CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain an Environmental / Safety Incident Plan (ESIP) which has been supplied to, and discussed with, the City of Cartersville Fire and Rescue Department.  We have a goal of coordinating drills with local agencies to help us remain prepared to implement the ESIP at the Brewery.\n\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed.  Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified.  If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nAnheuser-Busch's Cartersville Brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to improve safety.  In the late 1990's, the ammonia refrigeration pressure relief valves were all inspected and upgraded where necessary.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnheuser-Busch is pleased to share its record of safe operations with the citizens of Cartersville.
