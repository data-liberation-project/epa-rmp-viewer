If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Clemons Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a retail fertilizer and chemical sales business.  We offer anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers for growing corn.  The ammonia plant consists of two 12,000 gal. storage tanks plus associated piping and valves.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of both storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud.  According to EPA tables the end point is 6.9 miles.  Within the distace to the endpoint there is a population of 2565.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or enviromental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the vent of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia storage, it is our policy to notify the Clemons Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nWe do not plan any additional changes."
