      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary\nfor\nThe Dow Chemical Company\nDalton, Georgia Site\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at The Dow Chemical Company; Dalton Georgia Site are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our well-trained personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with The Whitfield County Fire and Sheriff Departments, both of whom we would rely upon for additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Dow Dalton facility manufactures latex and Styrofoam* extruded polystyrene board.  This facility is located at 1468 Prosser Drive, S.E., approximately 10 miles south of the town of Dalton, Georgia. The facility has two manufacturing plants on site, one for the production of latex which is shipped off-site for use in the paper and carpet industries, and one for Styrofoam* board which is used predominantly in the construction industry as and insulating material. We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include 1,3-Butadiene, Vinylidene chloride  [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-] and Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-].  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  1,3-Butadiene and   Vinylidene chloride  [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-] are used as raw materials for latex production.  Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-] is used in the production of Styrofoam*.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrati"

      "SummaryText": "ve controls and mitigation measures \nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Butadiene Storage Tank in the Latex Manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of 682,500 lb. of 1,3-Butadiene.  Passive systems such as dikes have been considered when evaluating this scenario.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.70 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi. This will break window glass and cause some structural damage to buildings depending upon the quality of construction.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Butadiene Rail Car in the Latex Manufacturing. The scenario involves the release of 150,000 lb. of 1,3-Butadiene in 10 minutes.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.   Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include sprinkler system(s) and deluge system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.19 miles.  This distance does not go beyond the Dow fenceline.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Vinylidene Chloride Storage Tank in the Latex Manufacturing.

Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include sprinkler system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 5 kw/m2 for 40 seconds is 0.01 miles.  This distance does not go beyond the Dow fenceline.\n\nStyrofoam* Manufacturing classifies as a Program 3 process.  The worst case scenario considered for this process involves a flammable substance, namely Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-].  The quantity released in the scenario is assumed to be 252,000 lb.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Passive mitigation considered in the scenario includes dikes.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.38 miles. \n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
