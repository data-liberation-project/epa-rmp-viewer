A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  As a company, we are committed to excellence in health, safety and the environment.    \n\nWe recently revitalized this commitment with an ambitious new initiative - The Goal is Zero.  As its name implies, this involves striving to achieve zero recordable injuries, zero environmental incidents, zero manufacturing process incidents, and zero distribution incidents.  The same dedication to excellence marks our Product Stewardship initiative, under which we address health, safety and environmental performance throughout our products' life cycles.  Product Stewardship and The Goal is Zero initiatives not only make good ethical and moral sense, but they respond to what our customers want and our communities expect: that we operate in a safe and environmentally sound manner.\n\nThe following sections provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities designed and implemented at the Mesa facility.  Also attached are the more detailed information (data elements) of our risk management program required by EPA's RMP rule.\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nArch Chemicals Mesa facility processes and supplies ultra high purity chemicals to the semiconductor and silicon wafer industries.  Products include acids, etchants, solvents and custom blend formulations.  In our processes, we use the following toxic chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in manufacture of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium fluoride soluti"

There are no RMP-regulated flammable chemicals handled or stored at/above threshold quantities at the Mesa facility.\n\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  For regulated toxic chemicals, one worst case scenario having the overall greatest endpoint distance along with an alternative scenario for each toxic chemical must be reported.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios and our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental releases.  Information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances are provided where pertinent.  Complete details of release quantities and distances these materials could travel before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public is provided in Section 3 of the RMPlan.  \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nThe selected worst case release scenario assume"

The default assumption is that the entire contents of the tank are released over a 10 minute period to the concrete below.  Upon release, the pressurized liquid forms a pool and vaporizes to gaseous ammonia.  Using the EPA OCA look up tables and EPA stipulated weather conditions (wind speed of 1.5 m/sec and F atmospheric stability class), potentially impacted public receptors include the Queen Creek schools, area residences and neighboring industries.  There are no EPA listed environmental receptors within the impact distance.  Although unrealistic, this scenario meets the requirements of release of the largest quantity from a vessel and has the farthest potential off site impact.  Other than administrative controls to limit storage volume, no other passive mitigation measures were considered in modeling of this scenario to limit the exposure distances.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nThe more likely alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the shearing of a pipe from the bottom of the ammonia storage tank.  Liquid ammonia (37,600 pounds) is released into the diked area.  Surface gaseous emissions from the liquid pool are reduced once ammonia flows into a second,  smaller below grade containment area.  Using the EPA OCA look up tables and stipulated alternative weather conditions (wind speed of 3.0 m/sec and D stability class), potentially impacted public receptors includes the neighboring residential population and employees at the MPC Chemicals, Southwest Polytek, and TRW industrial facilities.  There were no active mitigation measures included in modeling of this scenario to limit the exposure distances.  Protective barriers were installed to minimize occurrence of this type of incident.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonium hydroxide (ammonia solution"

Liquid ammonium hydroxide (22,600 pounds) is released to the floor of the ammonia process room.  Liquid ammonium hydroxide overflows into the containment sump in the room and to the closed containment tank.  The evaporation rate for the solution decreases rapidly after the initial release.  Using the EPA OCA look up tables and stipulated alternative weather conditions (wind speed of 3.0 m/sec and D stability class), potentially impacted public receptors are limited to the employees of MPC Chemicals located immediately adjacent to Mesa Facility's south property line.  Although vapors inside the room are directed to the Ammonia Vent Scrubber, it was assumed that the scrubber capacity will be exceeded.  Removals that would realistically be achieved by the scrubber were not used to limit exposure distances.\n\nThe selected alternative release scenario for hydrochloric acid is overflow of the bulk 37% HCl storage tank into the secondary containment area.  The operator stops the transfer pump and water is added to minimize acid vapors  Chemical release to the atmosphere is not instantaneous but volatilization from the liquid \"pool\" will occur.  Using the EPA OCA look up tables and stipulated alternative weather conditions, it was calculated that HCl vapors potentially impact employees of MPC Chemicals located immediately adjacent to Mesa Facilities south property line.  In the modeling of this scenario, it was assumed that all active mitigation systems (engineering and administrative controls) fail.\n\nTwo alternative release scenarios are presented for hydrofluoric acid (HF); one for 70% HF and a second for 55% HF.

Hazard Reviews identify things that could possibly go wrong so that these situations can be corrected and controlled before an incident occurs.\nProcess Controls:  The Mesa Facility has a variety of back-up systems which provide precise control of processes and maintain tight operating parameters.\nMonitoring Systems:  Product sensing detectors immediately identify any potential problems, giving operators an early warning which enables them to provide a quicker and more effective response.\nEmergency Response:  The Mesa Facility Emergency Response program is describe in a later Section of this Executive Summary.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program along with the chemical specific prevention actions work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nInvestigation records are maintained for all incidents that occur at our facility.  We have had seven (7)  accidental releases of hydrofluoric acid in the last three years that require reporting under the RMP rule.  The largest of these experienced since the 1996 start up of the facility was a 500 pound release of 55% liquid hydrofluoric acid.  As a result of these releases, injuries that required medical attention occurred to six on-site employees and one contract employee.  "
