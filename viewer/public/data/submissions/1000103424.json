All refrigerated areas in the facility are monitored by an ammonia detection system, which will automatically shut down and pump out any alarming area. Any alarm would also be sent to the refrigeration operator by a dial up modem. Also, the computer system will notify the refrigeration operator on any alarming or out of normal condition in the system (temperatures/pressures). All employees at the facility receive annual training on the emergency action plan\nTo deal with any possible release of ammonia, Evans CA LLC maintains an ongoing relationship with an experienced refrigeration contractor in Yakima and with the Cowiche Fire Department. In the event of a significant accident, the fire department is about five minutes away; response from Yakima (owner, refrigeration contractors) is about 20 minutes. Ammonia cartridge masks are available onsite. In the event of a large release, the Yakima HazMat team would likely respond to the site. In such cases, it is not expected or intended that persons would attempt to enter the facility until properly trained personnel with the appropriate PPE arrive.\n\nFive year release history   No releases\nThe system has not had any reportable releases of ammonia in the last five year period.  If any actual release occurred an incident investigation would be done to determine the cause and to find means or methods to reduce the possibility of a similar future occurrence."

      "SummaryText": "Program Approach\nThe facility has complied with both State and Federal regulations regarding ammonia used as a refrigerant and has in place both the OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (PSM)(29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP)(40 CFR, Part 68). These programs are readily available to on-site personnel to help in maintaining a safe operating facility. As required by RMP, an Off-site Consequence Analysis has been done for the facility to determine what impact the Worse Case and the more realistic Alternate Case releases of ammonia would have to the surrounding area.\nIt is intended that the PSM/RMP program be actively used, reviewed and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, public and environment.  It is expected that by following the work practices that are implemented at the facility only incidental releases of ammonia will occur due to routine maintenance procedures, or normal equipment wear and tear.\n\nFacility\nEvans CA LLC operates a controlled atmosphere fruit storage facility warehouse in the small community of Cowiche, Washington. The facility has a combination of controlled atmosphere rooms and non-controlled atmosphere rooms.  The facilities are in operation year round from the time freshly picked fruit is brought into the rooms, until the next harvest season begins. A refrigeration operator checks the operation of the system several times a week while continuous monitoring and alarming is done by the facility computer control system.\n\nThe refrigeration system uses ammonia, which is not only efficient but also easily detectable at very low concentrations.  The entire refrigeration system is controlled by a computer, which also provides alarming and auto-dial notification to the refrigeration technician if control parameters are out of acceptable limits. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. It is present as"
