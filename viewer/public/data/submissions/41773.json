The mechanical integrity of the system is completed by keeping a listing of parts recommended by the manufacturer for change-out if and when needed.  RC&E Refrigeration is the local refrigeration contractor who helps to insure that all maintenance and system change-out is completed properly.  The refrigeration technicians on staff assists in the mechanical integrity and general maintenance up-keep of the system.  The facility has a Process Safety Management Plan, which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program Requirements.  They also have a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication program, Confined Space Program (if needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  These programs, along with the Process Safety Management Program comprise a huge portion of Ben E. Keith Foods prevention portion.\n\nThe emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services Group, Inc.  Spill Response Solutions HAZMAT Crew, Fort Worth Fire Department and the Fort Worth Emergency Management Office (LEPC) will be requested to assist Ben E. Keith Foods if a release occurs from this location.  If an anhydrous ammonia release occurs at the 7650 Will Rogers Blvd location, employees will notify Refrigerations Technician (Dennis Davis) of a release, and personnel will get organized for an emergency action/response and possible evacuation of the facility and surrounding affected areas. The emergency response/action plan consists of HAZMAT Trained Spill Response Solutions and Ben E. Keith Foods personnel isolating the release point and isolating the release by shutting of supply valves to the affected area, or a manual shutdown of the entire refrigeration system if necessary.

This facility utilizes an employee electronic key card system to ensure that personnel working at this location are accounted for if evacuation is necessary.  The 911 calls should have been made by this time to notify other emergency response agencies (Fort Worth Fire Dept., and Fort Worth Emergency Management Office - LEPC) to assist in the mitigation and evacuation procedures.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the refrigeration system (storage vessel failure) for anhydrous ammonia.  This would be a release of 35,000 pounds of ammonia gas/vapor into the atmosphere.  Active mitigation was considered for this release, however, in a worst-case scenario, all efforts and devices would fail.  This release would result in a distance to endpoint of 2.3 miles.  The worst-case scenario would impact approximately 23,735 persons.  This information was determined by the use of RMP Comp, and Landview 5 software.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was completed for this facility based on an estimated release that could occur.  This release would be an equipment failure (anhydrous line).  This would be a 1/4 inch anhydrous line located in the dock area of the facility.  Because the line leak would be located in the upper area of the dock, the release would last for 10 minutes at 85 psi with a liquid flow rate of 62 pounds per minute, with a total anhydrous release of approximately 1330 pounds of anhydrous over 10 minutes.  This release of ammonia would have a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.01 miles.  This relatively short distance to endpoint would impact approximately 0 located in households near the facility.\n\nIt is Ben E. Keith Foods intention to fully comply with the Risk Management Plan and corresponding Process Safety Management Plan requirements due to the recent plant expansion.

      "SummaryText": "In this cold storage facility, (Ben E. Keith Foods), we handle anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the EPA, OSHA, etc.  The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold storage chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration purposes.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and use anhydrous ammonia combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided by the manufacturer of the ammonia refrigeration system, as well ass the training of our employees.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is cold storage/warehousing by refrigerating storage room via ammonia system.  The refrigeration system supplies cooling and freezer areas throughout the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is mostly a gas, but is also liquefied under pressure in the storage vessel, which is located on the roof of the motor room.  This liquid ammonia is condensed and cooled through the utilization of the refrigeration system.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the system at any one time is 35,000 pounds.\n\nOur employee (maintenance) conduct proper start-up procedures as listed in the manufacturer's Operation & Maintenance manual for the refrigeration system.  These personnel also review the operating procedures and maintenance tasks when needed to insure the proper and safe use of the ammonia in the refrigeration system to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of ammonia.  The maintenance tasks performed are visual inspections conducted daily; visual inspections conducted weekly, preventative mainten"
