These\nregulations mandate the investigation of potential accident scenarios which could effect\nthe surrounding population and environment as determined by published EPA\nregulations, guidelines and guidance materials. The scenarios prescribed for investigation\ninclude both a worst-case and an alternative release which could possible occur at the\nSoutheastern Adhesives (SEACO) facilities.\n\na)SEACO, under its present Senior Management, has adopted a pro-active approach to\nchemical safety by instituting a chemical accidental release policy governing all\nchemicals present at our stationary sources. This policy addresses the safe handling and\nstorage of all process chemicals and products, as well as, chemicals used in the day to\nday operations of our facility and allows for the monitoring of safe practices, procedures\nand conditions with daily visual inspections of all process and storage areas. If an\nemergency situation should ever occur, SEACO's emergency response plan would be\ninitiated. Designated, trained response teams and individuals would proceed with\nappropriate actions which are spelled out in the emergency plan, thus ensuring the safety\nof its employees, surrounding neighbors, and environment. \n\nBoth SEACO's \"Accidental Release Plan\" and \"Emergency Response Plan\" are contained\nin its general Programs and Policies Manual.\n \nb) SEACO owns and operates two stationary sources which are required to submit Risk\nManagement Plans to the EPA, they are similar in process:\n                                       1)   SEACO\n                                             815-D Virginia St., SW\n                                     "

Both formaldehyde and urea are stored in\nbulk.  We use a batch process where these chemicals along with others are measured by\nweight and charged to one of two 3,000 gallon reactors.  Through a series of pH and\ntemperature adjustments and controls, the final UF product is obtained.  All process steps\nare monitored for proper operation and all are under the constant supervision of trained\npersonnel.  These resins are then stored in bulk and shipped in appropriate containers. \nTo the best of our understanding the facilities are compliant with all applicable State and\nFederal Regulations.   \n\nSEACO has determined from the substances listed pursuant to section 112(r)(3) of the\nClean Air Act and its amendment SS68.130 List of  Regulated Toxic Substances and\nTheir Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention that it houses only one\nregulated substance in quantities at or above the given \"threshold quantities\": \nFORMALDEHYDE, held in maximum quantity (at any one time) of 84,500 pounds. at\nthe Lenoir, NC plant (stationary source).

In the event of such a large scale spill, the dike is sufficiently large to contain the\nentire contents of a worst-case scenario spill in a relatively small surface area pool and\nthe formaldehyde would be recovered by pumping into tanker trucks or holding tanks\nand held until the main storage unit was repaired or replaced.  According to the EPA's\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Guidance, (a document provided by the federal EPA to\nassist industry in the preparation of their RMP) such an accident might\nwarrant evacuation of the stationary source and notification of appropriate emergency\nresponse agencies who are designated to respond to potential crisis situations. \n\nThe following Worst-case scenario parameters used to determine data included in this\nRMP:\n    -84,500 lbs. formaldehyde released (50% by weight concentration in water,\n        <18,000 gallons contained in one 18,000 gallon tank @ 50-65 degrees             \n       Centigrade.

This scenario is unlikely as the\nreaction process is constantly monitored by trained, experienced personnel during the\ncritical stages.  A run-away reaction would not result in the release of 100% of the 50%\nformaldehyde solution charged to the reaction. The reaction of formaldehyde with urea\nproduces a large amount of heat and causes the acidity of the reaction mixture to increase\n(lower pH). Both the heat and the lower pH add to the instability of the reaction.\nTherefore, as the reaction proceeds and more formaldehyde reacts with urea, the process\nbecomes more unstable and the possibility of a runaway reaction increases but the\navailability of unreacted formaldehyde decreases.  It is also unlikely that all the reaction\nmixture would escape from the large vessel through its relatively small (24 inch) mouth,\nas the reaction vessel is never intentionally filled to capacity. The exact amount of\nunreacted formaldehyde released is impossible to determine; therefore, based upon\nreaction kinetics, vessel size and experience, a quantity of half (50% x 20,000lbs) of the\n(50%) formaldehyde/water solution charged to the reaction was used to conduct\ncalculations as this would be a generous estimate of a formaldehyde released from such a\nrunaway "
