To accomplish this, Ingredion requires contractors and employees at all levels of the organization to participate in these programs.  Operating unit personnel participate in hazard studies, incident investigations, periodic audits, and management of change reviews.  Teams with management, operator and contractor participation are responsible for the development of related programs and procedures.  Written policies reinforce the importance of employee participation and ensure process-related information is made available to those involved.  All employees actively participate in Ingredion's safety process.\n\n2.\tProcess Safety Information\n\nRecognizing the importance of developing and maintaining technical documentation, Ingredion has established documentation standards and developed a computer-based document control system.  When new or modified processes are developed, they are designed to meet or exceed all accepted trade and design standards.  Information from chemical suppliers, engineering and trade associations, regulatory agencies, and equipment suppliers is utilized to design processes.  Materials of construction, design specifications, safe operating limits, operating and maintenance procedures, chemical safety information, and other key information are collected or developed to ensure the process operates safely.

A process safety information file index helps direct personnel to the appropriate documents.  Ingredion's access to information policy ensures process safety information is available to all personnel working in or affected by the process.\n\n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nIngredion utilizes team-based hazard analysis techniques to ensure all potential hazards are identified and multiple levels of protection are in place to prevent an incident.  Teams with engineers, operators, and mechanics and safety professionals evaluate each component and procedure of each process.  If new processes are developed, hazard evaluations are conducted at each phase of the design and construction.  Multiple hazard evaluation techniques including hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis and what-if/checklists are utilized.    \n\nTrained study leaders, written hazard study protocol, and computerized action plans ensure each study is effective.  Every change to a process is similarly evaluated, and each process is comprehensively re-evaluated at least every five years. Ingredion has established a system to ensure timely response to findings and recommendations.  The computer-based system ensures: recommendations are documented, actions prioritized, and responsibilities assigned; a written schedule for completing action is developed; action is taken and documented; and action is communicated to affected personnel. \n\n4.\tOperating Procedures\n\nIngredion maintains detailed written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators.

In addition, Ingredion's distributed control systems (DCS) which control the process equipment have been programmed with safety interlocks that run in parallel and oversee normal operations providing yet another layer of protection.  \n\n5.\tTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures, Ingredion has developed a comprehensive training program for its employees and contractors.  New employees are required to complete a new hire orientation prior to assignment in the facility.  After successfully completing the new hire orientation, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  The new operator must demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner prior to working independently.  In addition, all operators must successfully complete periodic refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  \n\nPrior to working on covered processes at Ingredion, contractors are required to certify that each of their employees have necessary experience, credentials, and skills to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the systems is maintained.  Contractor management must provide this certification by listing the names of the individual contract employees.  Ingredion then provides additional training to every contractor employee prior to his or her assignment within the plant.  \n\nA computer-based training management package helps keep track of training for employees and makes sure refresher training is completed as required.  Contractor training records are kept manually in the contractor training manual."
