We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care.  In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our process equipment is designed, constructed and maintained using sound engineering practices and conforms to applicable industry codes and standards including those of the Chlorine Institute for equipment used in manufacturing and handling chlorine.  We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs that ensure site integrity.\n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  Examples of such controls include 1) installation of pressure safety valves to prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, 2) routine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good condition, 3) limiting inventory in storage tanks to eighty percent of the maximum capacity, 4) using materials of construction that are compatible with process chemistry, 5) monitoring vessel pressure and temperature continuously, 6) using a nitrogen pad inside certain tanks to prevent a fire from starting inside a tank, 7) installation of barriers around process vessels and storage tanks to prevent contact with moving vehicles, and others.\n\nHowever, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation measures that have been included in our design include installation of isola"

If a release occurs, we will use a dispersion model Systematic Approach For Emergency Response (SAFER), and meteorological data from our weather tower, to predict the plume direction and size, downwind ground level chemical concentrations, and the estimated time at which the plume will reach offsite areas.  This information will be communicated to 911, in case any actions need to be taken by emergency response agencies.  In addition, our Community Alert Network (CAN) system provides us the means to alert approximately 950 residents within a 25 square mile area around the plant in case of a release that may impact offsite areas.\n\n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant is primarily involved in manufacturing various inorganic and chlorinated organic chemicals.  Our products are distributed to customers via rail cars, tank trucks, and in containers.  As a part of this manufacturing process, we use and produce several substances that are covered by the risk management program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  These include chlorine, sulfur dioxide, chloroform, methyl chloride, vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride.  The maximum quantities of these regulated substances that could be present in plant processes are 2.2 million pounds of chlorine, 60,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide, about 460,000 pounds of methyl chloride, approximately 15 million pounds of chloroform, 18,000 pounds of vinyl chloride, and about 250,000 pounds of vinylidene chloride.  The RMP regulated processes are our chlorine plant, chlorine rail car loading, membrane cell room, chloromethanes plant, VFS pla"

All of these plants fall under the RMP Program Level 3 category.\n\nVulcan's products serve a multitude of vital needs throughout American and global economies, playing a role in nearly every modern industry and in thousands of products that consumers use every day.  Chlorine is sold as a product and is also used as feedstock in the chlorinated organics manufacturing process.  Common end uses of chlorine include treatment of municipal water supplies, sewage and wastewaters, and manufacture of bleach.  Sulfur dioxide is used in our membrane cell room to remove residual free chlorine from brine.  Chloroform and methyl chloride are sold as products; methyl chloride is also used in our chlorinated organics manufacturing process as feedstock.  Our customers use chloroform to manufacture refrigerant R-22, pharmaceuticals, plastics, dyes, resins and fire extinguishing agents.  Chloroform is also used as an extraction solvent in recovery of penicillin, vitamins and essential oils.  End uses for methyl chloride include manufacture of silicone products, synthetic rubber products, and agricultural chemicals.  Vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride are used to produce specialized hydrochlorocarbons that will be used by our customers as feedstocks in manufacturing third generation refrigerants.\n\nBesides process equipment, the plant has a number of tanks for storage of raw materials and products, rail car and truck loading/unloading facilities, a laboratory, and a research and development facility.  Because we handle large quantities of chemicals, we use a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  Information on these programs is provided in other sections of this executive summary.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n3.0  KEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's"

      "SummaryText": " RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that we provide information about two types of offsite consequence analysis scenarios:  worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  There are strict requirements for choosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a result, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative.  The purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to provide emergency planners with more information about the chemicals we handle and about their relative hazards.  The alternative release scenarios are more realistic than worst-case release scenarios but are still unlikely to happen.\n\nFollowing are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit exposure distances.  Information on the number and type of public and environmental receptors is also provided.  Estimates of the impacted population are based on U.S. Census Bureau data.  Information on environmental receptors was obtained from USGS topographic maps.\n\n3.1  Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario representing the toxic substances handled by Vulcan is a catastrophic rupture of a storage tank containing chlorine.  Vulcan administratively limits the quantity stored in the tank to 900,000 pounds.  Although we have several mitigation features on the storage tank that would limit the release rate, we assume that the entire quantity in the storage tank will release over a 10-minute period.  The chlorine released to the atmosphere travels more than 25 miles before dispersing below the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  Approximately 300,000 people live within 25 miles of the storage tank.  The public and environmental receptors that are located within this distance are schools, residences, hospitals, public recreational areas, prisons, commercial/industrial areas, and state and county parks.  \n\nThe toxic endpoint of 3 ppm is defined by EPA as the maximum concentration below which individual"

In this scenario, the entire quantity of vinylidene chloride, 250,000 pounds, is released to the atmosphere, where it ignites and explodes.  Although we have several features which help to prevent this scenario, or which mitigate the consequences of such a release, no credit is taken for these measures in this scenario.  The resulting vapor cloud explosion reaches the 1-psi endpoint about 0.31 miles (1,600 feet) from the storage tank.  The only public receptor is an industrial plant located adjacent to the Vulcan-Wichita plant.  No environmental receptors are impacted.\n\nOverpressure is defined as the peak pressure resulting from an explosion that is in excess of normal atmospheric pressure.  Effects of 1-psi overpressure may include shattering of windows.\n\n3.3  Alternative Toxic Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a break in a 3-inch chlorine transfer pipe between our chlorine and chloromethanes plants at the Wichita facility.  The automatic shutoff valve on the transfer line restricts the amount released to about 5,000 pounds.  The release lasts for 10 minutes.  The chlorine cloud travels 3.3 miles before dispersing below the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  Approximately 3,300 people live within this distance from the transfer pipe.  The public receptors that are located within this distance are industrial plants, residences, a school and a recreational area.  No environmental receptors are impacted.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide is a break in a 1-inch sulfur dioxide storage tank vapor line during unloading of sulfur dioxide from a tank truck into our process.

The maximum rate of vapor release into ambient air is approximately 80 pounds per minute (lbs/min).  The sulfur dioxide cloud travels about 1.2 miles before dispersing below the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  Approximately 80 people live within this distance from the storage tank.  The public receptors that are located within this distance are one industrial plant and residences.  No environmental receptors are impacted.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chloroform is an inadvertent overfilling of one of the chloroform storage tanks.  The chloroform is pumped into the diked area at a rate of 1,560 lbs/min.  Although a Vulcan employee is likely to notice the spill quickly, we assume that it continues for 3 hours without intervention for a total of 281,000 pounds of chloroform released into the diked area.  The chloroform forms a liquid pool inside the containment dike and evaporates at a maximum rate of 1,560 lbs/min.  The resulting cloud travels about 0.7 miles (3,700 feet) before dispersing below the toxic endpoint of 100 ppm.  Three industrial plants are located within this distance from the storage tank.  No environmental receptors are impacted.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for methyl chloride is a rupture in the 3-inch loading hose to a railcar resulting in the release of 28,000 pounds of methyl chloride to the atmosphere.  The flow rate from the process of 1,760 lb/min is stopped by a Vulcan employee 10 minutes after the release begins.  The 10 minute period is a conservative estimate of the time required for a Vulcan employee to notice and stop the release.  The flow from the railcar is limited by an excess flow valve to 1,045 lb/min.  This flow is also stopped after 10 minutes when an operator climbs to the top of the railcar and closes the valve.

Approximately 15 people live within this distance from the railcar.  The public receptors located within this distance are industrial plants and residences.  No environmental receptors are impacted.\n\n3.4  Alternative Flammable Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammables is a rupture of a railcar containing 18,000 pounds of vinyl chloride.  This is a conservative scenario since a catastrophic failure of a railcar is an extremely unlikely event.  The entire quantity of vinyl chloride is assumed to be involved in an explosion of the subsequent vapor cloud.  The resulting overpressure from the explosion falls below the overpressure limit of 1 psi at approximately 0.1 mile (530 feet) from the railcar.  The only public receptor impacted within this distance is an industrial plant adjacent to Vulcan's Wichita plant.  No environmental receptors are impacted.\n\n4.0  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  We are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and this RMP rule.  Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below in Sections 4.1 through 4.12.\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility.  These documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees and address important process parameters such as 1) operating limits for the equipment, 2) design basis and configuration of the equipment, and 3) physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our processes.  Plant personnel rely on these documents to perform their job functions properly, consistently and in a safe manner.\n\nChemical information is usually docume"

After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\n\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  The frequency of refresher training is decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\n4.5  Mechanical Training\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Preventive and predictive maintenance practices keep equipment in good working condition and warn operators and maintenance personnel of problems, allowing proactive repairs to be completed.  Preventive measures taken include proper materials of construction (e.g., to prevent corrosion, much of the piping in certain sections of our plant is monel, Teflon-lined or fiberglass rather than carbon steel), use of double-seal pumps in organic chemical service, and use of water treatment chemicals that will minimize corrosion of process equipment such as heat exchangers.\n\nPredictive maintenance technologies employed include vibration analysis, thermography, ultrasonic and oil analysis.  Vibration analysis is used for early detection of bearing problems on pumps, compressors, fans and motors.  Thermography is used to locate problems on electrical equipment.  Ultrasonic technology uses sound waves to determine the thickness of tank walls and pip"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\n5.0  CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error.  In addition to the prevention program, the Vulcan-Wichita plant has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public, and the environment.  These features may contain or control a release, detect a release, or reduce the consequences of a release.  They may also prevent a release by providing strict design standards for process equipment.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility.\n\n5.1  Release Detection\n\na)  On-line vinyl chloride detectors in areas where vinyl chloride is used or stored\nb)  Releases are detected quickly because at least one operator is present at each plant at all times and operators inspect their plants on a routine schedule\nc)  Video surveillance of the loading/unloading areas\nd)  Procedures require that a Vulcan-Wichita plant employee be present during loading and unloading operations\ne)  Hand-held monitoring equipment such as draeger tubes are used as needed for release detection\n\n5.2  Release Containment and Control\n\na)  Breather valves on storage tanks discharge to a thermal oxidizer to capture and incinerate material released\nb)  Some pressure relief valves discharge to scrubbers where the stream is"
