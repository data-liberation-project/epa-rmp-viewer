      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies for the Briscoe Chupadera CGF-A, which is owned and operated by Western Midstream (WES). Because there are no employees at the facility more than 4 hrs. /day, the station is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard, however elements of the PSM program may be implemented as a best management practice.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response \n\n\n\nWES has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention. WES has an extensive operator and maintenance training program. Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. WES' policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials. However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies. If the situation requires, WES will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nLocation and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe Briscoe Chupadera CGF-A is a facility that receives production from area oil and gas wells via flow line. The production is treated to separate gas, water and condensate. The gas is further processed through compressors causing a rapid temperature and pressure change via a Joule-Thompson (JT) valve which condenses the lighter hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane, to condense forming a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) product. The NGL product is stored in a pressurized bullet tank, with a volume of 12,000 gallons and operating pressure of ~200 psi.\n\n\n\nA total rupture of the NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Briscoe Chupadera CGF-A. The tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles. There are industr"

      "SummaryText": "y receptors are within a 0.4 mile radius of the NGL tank, however these facilities utilize the OSHA PSM Normally Unoccupied Remote Facility (NURF) exemption as defined in 29 CFR 1901.119(b). Therefore these facilities are not considered \"public receptors\" per EPA's Risk Management Program. As a result, this facility has been evaluated for a Program 1 level RMP under 40 CFR 68.\"\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Coordination\n\n\n\nThe Briscoe Chupadera Ranch CGF-A is a non-responding facility. The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. The Briscoe Chupadera Ranch CGF-A has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e. Fire Department). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\n \n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on various safety issues, such as flammable substances, are held regularly. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards through WES' Near Miss and Observation programs.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThere is no accident history to report. Should an emergency invo"
