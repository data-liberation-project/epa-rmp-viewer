A review of site operations revealed that two substances stored on site were regulated under Section 68.130, which include chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Seven, 1-ton cylinder chlorine tanks and seven, 1-ton cylinder sulfur dioxide tanks are stored in the chlorine building next to the chlorine contact chamber. The total maximum on-site storage of chlorine is 14,000 pounds, and the total maximum on-site storage of sulfur dioxide is 14,000 pounds. The threshold limits for these substances are 2,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\nThis document satisfies the RMP executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and provides the public with a description of the risk management program at TPCG-STP.\n\n\n\n2.1    Develop and Implement a Management System (40 CFR 68.15)\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant Superintendent at TPCG-STP is responsible for the development and implementation of the risk management program for the facility.

Seven, 1-ton cylinder sulfur dioxide tanks are stored at TPCG-STP. Information related to the safe temperature and filling capacity of tanks is provided by the Compressed Gas Association and is maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nTPCG-STP maintains storage and process limits, and safety information relative to the recommended storage parameters for the process equipment used on site.

Hazard reviews are performed on an established schedule of every five years.\n\n \n\nTPCG-STP primarily uses the hazard review checklist provided in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants to perform this evaluation.  Through this process two specific hazards have been identified: \n\n\n\n?Reuse of gaskets - according to the Chlorine Manual, prepared by the Chlorine Institute, a release of chlorine is most often a result of reusing gaskets. The operating procedures specify the use of new gaskets during change out of the 1-ton cylinders at the TPCG-STP.  \n\n?Improperly made up pipe joints - Specifications for pipe joints are outlined in the equipment manuals for making up pipe joints and are incorporated into the operation procedures for the TPCG-STP.\n\n\n\nThe hazard review provides a means for determining if the process is designed and operated in accordance with standard industry codes and federal and/or local regulations. The review requires a documented inspection of the process and operating procedures to ensure compliance. The hazard review must be updated, at a minimum, every five years or after major process changes. A copy of a hazard review checklist provided in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants is included in the Risk Management Plan document maintained at the facility. This checklist is used to perform Hazard Reviews at the TPCG-STP.\n\n\n\n2.2.3    Operating Procedures (40 CFR 68.52)\n\n\n\nTPCG-STP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect chan"
