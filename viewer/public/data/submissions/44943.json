Each of these elements are components of the site's PSM Program, summarised below.\n  \n3a. Process Safety Information\n\nWritten Process Safety Information (PSI) has been compiled for the MEK and PDA Units by the plant's Engineering Department. The information compiled includes:\n\na) Data on the safe use and handling of Ammonia and Propane (e.g. Material Safety Data Sheets);\nb) Data on the process technology (e.g. process flow diagrams, process chemistry, flow rates, storage capacities, operating limits and evaluation of the consequences of deviation);\nc) Data on the equipment used in the process (e.g. piping & instrument diagrams, materials compatibility, energy ratings and classification, control devices and emergency systems, ventilation systems, and design basis including conformance to applicable codes and standards).\n\nPSI for the MEK and PDA Units were generated before and during Process Hazard Analyses for the processes that use Ammonia and Propane.  This enables the employees involved in operating these processes to identify and understand the potential hazards associated with the processes.\n\n3b. Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs)\n\nRevalidation PHA studies for the processes involving Ammonia and Propane have been completed in accordance with PSM Regulations using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique. Each Process Pazard Analysis addresses aspects including process hazards, process incident history, process control devices and detection systems, evaluation of failure of process control devices, equipment location, and human factors.  A team of employees having experience and knowledge of the process design, operation and maintenance, and knowledge of how to complete a PHA performs each study.

Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are prepared for all processes at the facility, including those using Ammonia and Propane. The operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities in the plant.  Procedures are updated to reflect current operating practices, and are certified annually for accuracy.\n\nSpecific information and instructions covered by operating procedures include startup, normal operation, emergency operation, shutdown, operating limits, operating controls, chemical-specific health and safety information, required personal protective equipment, and use of safety systems.  Written Safety procedures are also provided for specific operations such as Hot Work, Lock-out / Tag-out, Confined Space Entry and Line Breaking.\n\n3d. Training\n\nEmployees involved in operating processes using Ammonia and Propane have received training to ensure they have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the requirements specified in the written Operating Procedures.  Refresher training is provided every three years at a minimum, or sooner if warranted by changes to operating conditions, equipment or procedures.  If refresher training is required more frequently than every three years, it will be triggered through the Management Of Change process (described below).  Training records are maintained for each employee to show the date training was conducted, the material covered by the training, and the means used to verify that the training was understood.\n\n3e. Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe IWI Farmers Valley Plant has a program to ensure the Mechanical Integrity (MI) of equipment used to process and handle Ammonia and Propane.

Equipment inspection and testing is conducted in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Records of inspections and testing are maintained to show the date, equipment identification, inspector, type of test or inspection performed, and test results or observations. \n \nIf deficiencies are noted during equipment inspection and testing, corrective actions are taken in a timely manner to assure safe operation of the process.  In some cases, equipment inspections are driven by permit requirements as well as the Mechanical Integrity program. \n\n3f. Management of Change (MOC)\n\nA Management of Change form is generated when there is a change (except for replacement in kind) to equipment, process chemicals, technology, procedures, or a change to the facility that will affect a process that handles Ammonia or Propane.  Work orders for such changes pass through the Safety Department and Engineering to ensure the proposed change is carefully evaluated before implementation (eg: to assure that proper materials of construction and good engineering practices are employed). Engineering will make changes to the P & IDs to keep the Process Safety Information up to date. Operations and Maintenance personnel are trained prior to start up of a modified process.\n\n3g.

An independent auditor and employees having experience and knowledge of the covered processes, and knowledge of the program requirements conducts the compliance audits.  Records of the compliance audit reports are maintained to document the results of the audits and any corrective actions taken.\n\n3i. Incident Investigation\n\nAll incidents that resulted in or could have resulted in a release of Ammonia or Propane are investigated promptly.  The incident investigation starts with the completion of an Incident Investigation Report prepared by the supervisor on duty at the time of the incident. The report is distributed to the plant Management Team and plant personnel.  The Incident Investigation Team is made up of employees having experience and knowledge of the processes affected by the incident, and knowledge of incident investigations.\n \nFollowing the incident investigation, a report is prepared to include the following information: \n\n(a) date, time, and location of the incident; \n(b) employees involved in the incident, and their roles; \n(c) date of the incident investigation;\n(d) names of employees on the incident investigation team;\n(e) description of the incident, including a chronology of events;\n(f) root causes and contributing causes, including conditions at the time of the incident, and;\n(g) recommendations to prevent a recurrence.\n\nFollow-up actions, that are taken as a result of the recommendations in the incident investigation report, are documented and records of the reports and follow-up actions are maintained for a minimum"

Employees routinely have opportunities to participate in other safety processes in the accident prevention program. These include Process Hazard Analyses, Management Of Change, Employee Training and Incident Investigations.\n\n3k. Hot work Permits\n\nThe IWI Farmers Valley plant has an established Hot Work permit program. Hot Work operations include burning, welding, drilling, grinding, torch cutting or other spark producing activity. Under the program, a hot work permit must be issued prior to commencing hot work operations in the Ammonia and Propane units. The hot work permit indicates the type and method of hot work to be conducted, the equipment that the hot work will be performed on, the date, time, and location authorized for the hot work, the presence of fire prevention and protection systems meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a), and signatures of the supervisory employees authorizing the hot work.  A separate Hot Work permit must be issued for each Hot Work operation, and a separate Hot Work permit must be issued for each day.
