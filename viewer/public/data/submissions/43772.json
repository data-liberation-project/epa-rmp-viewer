Calumet Shreveport has established policies and systems to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Calumet Shreveport.\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCalumet Shreveport site has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release.  In addition to handling the release, the refinery has also established a way to alert the community in the event of a significant release.  In conjunction with our local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the refinery has ability to notify the local community through radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\n\nThe Vice President of Refining has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented.  The Vice President of Refining has assigned the role of Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program to a staff member with the necessary background, training and experience.

Description and Regulated Substances\n\nCalumet Shreveport is a whole crude refinery and petroleum products facility located in Shreveport, Louisiana. Calumet Shreveport uses crude petroleum as their feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including liquefied petroleum gases, gasoline, diesel fuel, lubricating and gear oils, waxes and asphalt. Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in some process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  In total, Calumet Shreveport has 8 process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  These units are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\n\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Calumet Shreveport. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by Calumet Shreveport, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n  Employee Participation\n\nCalumet Shreveport encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

This information along with operational procedures are kept on the electronic network server.  Operational procedures are updated and reviewed by operation personnel.  These operation procedures assist employees in initial training, refresher training and day-to-day activities.\n\nSafety meetings are held on a monthly basis for plant personnel.  Regulations updates, safety policies and procedures, and current safety events are the main topics during these safety meetings.  All meetings are documented and kept on file.  The union has representatives on the Plant Safety Committee which meets monthly.  Safety concerns, programs, audits, employee participation and other safety ideas are discussed during the meetings.\n\n  Process Safety Information\n\nCalumet Shreveport maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that are specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nCalumet Shreveport has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Calumet Shreveport Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study to perform these evaluations.  A HAZOP uses a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design.  Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Calumet Shreveport Refinery assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.  The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator may utilize outside contractors that lead PHAs when appropriate.\n\n   Operating Pro"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and at least annually certified by the Area Unit Supervisor as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks\n\n   Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Calumet Shreveport has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New operational employees receive basic training and they are later paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least on a three-year cycle.  Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired.
