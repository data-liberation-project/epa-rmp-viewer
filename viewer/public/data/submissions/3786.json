The terminal functions as a direct transfer facility for anhydrous ammonia used by Farmlands 600,000 producer-members to grow crops that provide high-quality, low-cost food for families around the world.\n\nFacility snapshot\n\nAnnual volume of 40,000 tons of ammonia is distributed through the Farmland facility that has been supplying co-ops in northern and northwestern North Dakota for more than a decade.  As a terminal, the facility provides a vital link in the chain of Farmland inputs. Anhydrous ammonia, produced at Farmlands nitrogen manufacturing facilities, is shipped to the Devils Lake terminal where it is transferred from rail cars to trucks.  By eliminating much of the shipping costs for the co-ops, the terminal helps contain the cost of fertilizer for Farmland member-owners as well as provide a convenient location for them to get their product.\n\nImpact on the community\n\nFarmland is a solid, reliable member of the Devils Lake community.  Its employees are committed to customer service and the facility is available to service member-owners as needed throughout the year.  Farmland's Devils Lake employees know their customers are also their neighbors and strive to \"always be there if someone needs us.\"\n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nThe Farmland operators who run the facility during planting season are seasoned terminal veterans imported from other Farmland ammonia terminals.  They bring years of experience with them as they service area cooperatives.\n\nFarmland employees recognize community involvement and volunteerism as the most effective way to improve the communities they live and work in.\n\n\n\n\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nFarmland Industries Inc., is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future gener"

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a \"public danger zone.\" Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release; however, as with the worst-case, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor, and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.

      "SummaryText": " is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nFarmlands hypothetical worst-case scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from an 80 ton rail car unloading at the facility.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank, in 10 minutes.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with this type of release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical worst-case event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of pressurized vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternate Case Toxic Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical worst-case, tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present, as they are through out the terminal, and operator intervention which tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release sc"

The hoses are assumed to fail and release ammonia for a few seconds before the excess flow valves shut of the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program. A  Formal process hazard analysis revalidation is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
