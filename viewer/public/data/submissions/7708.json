The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process. The operators are consulted annually at safety meetings to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\n\n1.4.1.5  Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Eugene Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration, and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meets the design standards required for service in the plant\u0012s processes.  The mechanical integrity program includes:\n\n7 specifications for inspection and testing of process equipment\n7 specifications for replacement parts and equipment\n7 procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment\n7 procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, hot work, confined space entry, and line or equipment opening\n7 training of maintenance personnel\n7 documentation of maintenance activities\n\n1.4.1.6 Management of Change\n\nThe Eugene Plant management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does"

(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Eugene, OR.  The facility is located on Highway 99 North and is adjacent to another Georgia-Pacific plant that manufactures plywood.  The resin facility consists of a plant that was originally constructed in 1960.  Overall, the facility employs 25 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Eugene, Oregon plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Eugene Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Eugene Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Eugene Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Eugene Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n \n7 an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInformation"

      "SummaryText": "further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Eugene Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the Eugene Plant.  In fact, the Eugene Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Eugene Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Eugene Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Eugene Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Eugene Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Eugene Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the enviro"

These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Eugene Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Eugene Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the State LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\n1.2 Regulated Substances\n\nThe Eugene Plant only handles Formaldehyde and Epichlorohydrin solutions in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program Level 3 processes at the plant.\n\n Regulated Substance\tProcess\tProcess Quantity*, lbs\tRMP Threshold, lbs*\nFormaldehyde Solution (51%)\tStorage in Unpressurized Tanks\t97,800\t15,000\nEpichlorohydrin (100%)\tStorage in Unpressurized Tanks\t183,300\t20,000\n\n* Process and threshold quantity is the quantity of \u0013pure\u0014 chemical, not of the solution\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Eugene Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.

An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Eugene Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n\n7 one worst case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n \n7 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n \n7 one worst case and one alternative release scenario for the class of flammable substances in Program 3 processes\n\n1.

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration based on modeling is 0.65 miles.  The U.S. Census indicates that 420 people live within this distance from the location of the facility; several public receptors are also located within this distance, including residences, businesses, industries, a daycare center, and a golf course..  No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\nThe \u0013alternative case release scenario\u0014 for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the overfilling of a formaldehyde storage tank and the spillage of 100 gallons (480 lbs of pure formaldehyde) of solution into the concrete diked area.

Propane is stored on-site in a 250 gallon (1,100 pound) storage tank, however, this quantity is less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince 1991, the Eugene Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements:\n\nProgram 3\u0017essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nProgram 2\u0017requires simplified versions of 7 of the 12 elements of the Program 3 prevention program (not applicable for Eugene Plant)\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Eugene Plant\u0012s Program 3 prevention program that address EPA\u0012s RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Eugene Plant\u0012s Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.4.1.1 Process Safety Information-the Eugene Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipmen"
