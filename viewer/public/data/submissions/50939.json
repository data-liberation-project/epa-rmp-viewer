      "SummaryText": "Industrial Chemicals Corporation (ICC) is a small business engaged in the wholesale distribution of bulk chemicals.  They have operated at the Arvada facility since 1971 with an excellent safety record.  Although ICC handles a number of chemicals, only ethyl ether  and piperidine are covered under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  ICC's Emergency Response Plan and overall Risk Management Plan were developed in the early 1990s for the entire facility, and ICC's RMP for ethyl ether and piperidine are based on these existing plans.\n\nPiperidine is delivered from the supplier in 44,000-pound loads in an over-the-road tanker truck to the ICC facility.  After inspection, the piperidine is transferred under nitrogen pressure to a dedicated, 3-compartment ICC tanker truck.  The dedicated tanker truck is held on site until the customer requests delivery.  ICC delivers one compartment full (about 1850 gallons) to the customer and returns the partially filled tanker truck to the ICC facility.  Deliveries continue until the trailer is empty, at which time the dedicated tanker truck is ready to receive another bulk shipment from the supplier. Trailer is parked on diked concrete containment area and is sealed and secured. Smaller quantities may be drummed for longer term storage.\n\nEthyl ether is delivered in tank trucks containing approximately 7,500 gallons (45,000 lb).  These tank trucks are parked overnight at the unloading area and are unloaded into 55-gallon drums for delivery to customers.  The empty tanker is removed the same day unloading is completed.  Drums of ethyl ether are stored on site in a refrigerated storage trailer or in a sprinkled warehouse.
