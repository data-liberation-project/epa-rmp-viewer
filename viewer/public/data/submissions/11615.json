Management is willing to change procedures to provide better systematic support of risk reduction practices.\n\nb)  The facility has the following toxic substances above the threshold quantity on table 1 Federaly Regulated Substances List and Threshold Quantiies for Accidental Release Prevention:  Ammonia (conc 20% or greater).  30% Aqueous Ammonia is stored in a 18400 gal. and is used as Nox abatement (SCR) for Gas Turbine.\n\nc)  The worst case scenario is a catastrophic rupture of the SCR tank spilling the entire content of the tank into the diked area surronding the tank.  The Distance to Toxic End Point is 0.3 miles with no known sensative receptors affected.  A secondary containment (dike) is used for passive mitigation.\n\n     The atlernative scenario is a ruptured transfer hose used to fill the SCR tank creating a spill of 500 gal. onto the ground.  The Distance to Toxic End Point is 0.1 miles with no known sensative receptors affected.  The plant spill responce kit is used for passive mitigation.\n\nd)  The accidental release prevention and emergency responce policies are covered by the plants regulatory required  training program, equipment operating procedures, casualty procedures, preventive management of change procedures and predictive maintenance programs.  In addition, the SCR system is fully automated with remote indication of all key parameters available to the plant shift supervisor.\n\ne)  There has been no accidents at the facility in the last five years.\n\nf)  Emergency Responce Plan Brief: \n\nThe Escondido facility, known as Goal Line LP, is owned by PurEnergy and operated by GE Contractual Services (GECS). Goal Line LP supplies thermal coolant to the Iceo"

It is to be recognized that this is only a plan, and not a prescriptive document.  Each incident is a unique event; therefore, this Plan is designed to incorporate the flexibility to tailor the response to meet the emergency.\n\nThis Plan is supported by a set of implementing procedures.  A listing of these procedures is included as Appendix A.\n\nThe Plant Manager is responsible for promulgation, implementation, training and maintenance of the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThis Plan meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, proposed 8 CCR 5192, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, and 19 CCR 2731, Emergency Response Plans and Procedures.\n\ng)  There are currently no recognized deficiencies associated with the SRC aqueous ammonia system.\n\nh)  The facility as it applies to the covered process is Y2K capable."
