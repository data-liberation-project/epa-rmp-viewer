      "SummaryText": "Triple Peak Surface Water Treatment Plant is located in Comal County, Texas, in a rural, primarily residential area.  The Triple Peak Water Treatment Plant is located in the city of Canyon Lake, Texas.  The water plant uses chlorine gas as the primary water disinfectant.\n\nThe entire supply on-hand consists of a maximum of two (2), one-ton containers.  There is room to add two (2) more one ton containers if ever needed.  Vacuum feed/injection system is used to prevent leaks in the system.  A chlorine leak detector is installed with an audible alarm system to alert personnel of chlorine leaks.  There are SCBA units on-site for chlorine emergencies.  The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times per day by an on-site operator and monitored daily on the weekends.  Preventative maintenance is performed regularly.\n\nA Hazard Assessement has been conducted and documented in accordance with 40 CFR 68.20 - 68.42 and a prevention program has been implemented to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.48 - 68.60. There have been no accidental chlorine gas releases within the last five years.\n\nCanyon Lake Water Service Company has developed an emergency response plan for the Water Treatment Plant.  This plan identifies procedures and response actions to be taken in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.  The emergency response has been coordinated with Canyon Lake Fire Department."
