      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacturing rigid polyurethane foam board insulation.  Due to the environmental regulations requiring the facility to discontinue the use of hydrochloroflourocarbons (HCFCs), which are known ozone depleting substances, the facility will be replacing it with Pentane, which is the only regulated substance present at our facility. The Pentane will serve as the blowing agent.   \r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Additionally, the facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.
