Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Storage & Distribution.  We have three RMP regulated substances present at our facility.  The substances are Aqueous Ammonia 30%, cyclohexlamine, and Ethylenediamine. Listed below is the way the RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site. \n\n\n\n1.Ethylenediamine is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. \n\n\n\n2. Aqueous Ammonia 30% is received in 330 gal portable tanks and 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What-If\" technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and proces"
