All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nIneos  truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule, in particular, information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nIneos  hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Ineos  has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\r\nOn June 10, 2015, the site experienced a failure at a joint.  This allowed hydrocyanic acid gas to be released.  This resulted in a fatality onsite.  The site has implemented changes to the process operations and procedures to prevent a similar incident from occurring at the facility again.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\r\nIneos  carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n6.\tPlanned"

      "SummaryText": "Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe site added a requirement to conduct LOPA studies on all new and revalidated HAZOPs.  The site initiated quarterly management audits that include elements of PSM/RMP.  Additionally, the management team conducts a monthly housekeeping audit that incorporates PSM/RMP audit items (ie, fire proofing, insulating, painting, etc).  The site has implemented a Behavior-Based Safety Program.  The site shut down the catalyst plant in 2018 which reduced the amount of hazardous chemicals onsite."

      "SummaryText": "Ineos  Green Lake RMP Executive Summary\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at  Ineos  are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe process used to produce Ineos  Green Lake products contain quantities of flammable or listed hazardous chemicals which require application of Process Safety Management (PSM) as required in OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 and the  EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  INEOS management strongly supports Process Safety Management  and the Risk Management Program and recognises it as a good business practice as well as a good approach to protecting workers and the public from industrial operation hazards.  Ineos  Green Lake applies the basic principles of Process Safety Management and the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nIneos  has 8 EPA RMP regulated substances present at our facility above the threshold quantity.  These substances include; \r\n\tAcrylonitrile\r\n\tAmmonia\t\t\t\r\n\tButane\r\n\tPropylene\t\t\r\n\tPropane\r\n\tChlorine\r\n\tSulfur Dioxide\r\n\tHydrogen Cyanide\r\n\t\t\r\nAcrylonitrile is the end product of our process. Ammonia (anhydrous) and Propylene are utilized as raw materials in the production of Acrylonitrile.  Propane is an impurity in the Propylene. Butane is utilized in catalyst activation. Chlorine is utilized in water purification. Sulfur Dioxide is utilized as an inhibitor. A by-product of the Acrylonitrile process is Hydrogen"

      "SummaryText": "fresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nIneos  carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Ineos to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ineos .  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nIneos conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nIneos promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
