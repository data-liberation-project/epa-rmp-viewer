Van Hoevenberg (MVH) in the Town of North Elba, near Lake Placid, NY. Operational since February 2000, the track features an refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain an ice surface of the track. This system operates seasonally, typically from October to April, with around-the-clock staffing during  operation.\n\nGiven the use of over 10,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, the facility falls under the purview of the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, necessitating the development of a comprehensive Risk Management Program(RMP) to ensure the safety of employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nThe Key components of ORDA MVH RMP include:\n\u0095\tManagement System: A structured framework is in place to assign responsibilities and guide the implementation of the RMP.\n\u0095\tPrevention Program: Compliant with 40 CFR Part 68  and OSHA's 29 CFR 1910 Standards. ORDA MVH Prevention Program, detailed in section 7 of this RMP submission, outlines measures to uphold ORDA MVH's commitment to safe operations and accident prevention. It encompasses twelve major elements, including Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Employee Participation, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Hot Work, and Contractor.\n\u0095\t5 Year Accident History: ORDA MVH has not experienced any releases or near-miss incidents warranting inclusion in the RMP.\n\u0095\tOffsite Consequence Analysis: Despite the absence of incidents, ORDA MVH has completed an Offsite Consequence Analysis, use EPA's RMP*Comp, as mandated by regulations, evaluating both worst-case and alternative release scenarios involving hypothetical ammonia releases. Both scenarios identify potential impacts on public and environmental receptors.\n\n         The worst"

This plan includes emergency notification and evacuation procedures, with employees trained to respond effectively. Coordination with local response agencies ensures a comprehensive emergency response, with offsite consequence analysis findings shared with these agencies.\n\nIn conclusion, ORDA MVH remains committed to proactive risk management, ensuring the safety of employees, the community, and the environment, through comprehensive prevention, preparedness, and response measures."
