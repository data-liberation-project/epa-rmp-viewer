More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.    \n\nHi Plains Feed LLC maintains and operates their Anhydrous Ammonia Bulk System in strict accordance with all federal, state, and local authorities.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspects our plan on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement.  Changes or improvements in the facility's equipment and SOP's will be acted upon immediately following the enforcement agency (EPA, OSHA, FDA, etc.) request, or as found to be necessary by our staff.    \n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site specific operating procedures, and plant maintenance.  Employees are competency tested over the training material.  Each employee uses ammonia proof goggles, gloves, and respirators, as well as, assurance plenty of emergency safety water is available during maintenance operations.\n\nWith the aforementioned training in mind, it makes it very easy to report that absolutely no injury actions or property damage has occurred at this facility for the past 5 years.  \n\nOur emergency action plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public, and the area first responders.
