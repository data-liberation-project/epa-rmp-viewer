      "SummaryText": "The Smokehouse Compressor Station, located in Logan Couny, WV, is a Natural Gas Dew Point Control facility. The facility is designed to process up to 15 Million Cubit Feet of Natural Gas per day.The Facility will be brought on line in late May or early June of 2009.                 Low pressure gas enters the Station from a greathering system (approximately 5 million cubit feet per day).The gas is then compressed to a pressure of 750 psig and sent to a Natural Gas Dew Point control plant. The gas is then cooled to 20 df and mixed with ethylene glycol to prevent freezing and remove water in the natural gas. The natural gas liquids (propane's plus C-3's) are then removed by the designed process of heat, cold and expanison. The Facility will product 1000/1500 gals of propane's plus per 1 million cubit feet of Natural Gas.     Ethane, Propane, N and Ifso Butane, N and Iso f Pentanes are regulated substances each with a TQ of 10,000 lbs.    With the  volume stored of regulated substances vs the trainsit gas stream, only the storage area was evaluted when determining the RMP eligibility Program Level. The interconnecting piping would make therefrigeration plant part of the process, but the requirements would not change in relation to the distance to the overpressure end point of one psi or resulting RMP Program Level.  There are 2 pressurized tanks, a storage of 30,000 gals each.              Worst Case Scenarios  We used RMP Comp and calcuated a mixture of Ethane, Propane, Butanes and Pentane's Plus to determine the worst case scenario distance of the Vapor Cloud explosion of 0.5 miles. This would effect 26 homes and 78 residents.  The alternate release scenario involves a Truck pullaway explosion' with the driver pulling away without diconnecting his hoses. This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the hose 4.1 gals or 17 lbs of lpg. This scenario estimates a sudden release and immcdiate shutdown with the active mitigation system (Snappy Joes Safety Val"
