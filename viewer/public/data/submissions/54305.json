              "Description": " The Smokehouse Compressor Station located in Logan County WV is a Natural Gas Dewpoint Control Facility designed to process natural gas( Extracting some of the C-3+ (propanes plus) from the gas stream. The Plant will come on line in late May or early June 09. Processing 5 million cubit feet of natural gas per day. Low pressure gas is brought into the Facility at low pressure and compressed p to 1100 psig. The high pressure gas is then sent to the Dewpoint plant where it is injected with ethylene glycol to prevent freezing and remove the intrained water in the natual gas. The gas is then cooled through a series of heat exchangers and a cold vessel (the cold is from the refrigration system) and sepont to a Dethanizer Tower that is operating at 250 dF. This seperates the C-3+ liquids in the stream. The natrual gas is the sent to the sales pipeline and the liquids are sent to the 2 30,000 gal storage tanks, and ten trucked to another facility for farther processing. The facility will produce 4000 to 5000 gals of LPG per day The Liquid will be 4% ethane, 25% propane 30% butane and 41% Pentanes +. These are Regulated substances each with a Total Quanity of over 10,000 lbx. The stored volume of stored regulated subatance vs the gas steam, only the starage area was evaluated when determing RMP eligiability or program leve.There are 2 30,000 Storage Tanks, the taks are equiped with pressure relief valves, excess flow valve and snappy joe emergency shut off valves. RMP Comp is used to determined to calculate the distances for a Vapor Cloud Exposion. The Storage and Process area will be equiped with Hydroncarbon Monitors in case of a release, these will trigger a ESD shut down of the Facility. The Facility is subject to OSHA psm, OHSA 29 CFR1910.119, CHK ISO 14001, EPA 40 CFR 112.7 or the SPCC PROGRAM and NFPA 58 is complied with. In the unlikely event of a fire the employees may respond to an incipient stage fire and then must evacuate the Facility. An emnergency Action Plan developed to 29 CFR 1910.38(a)is in place to establish procedures for the safe evacuation of the facility and summon emergency response organizations.",

These Valves are tie to ESD,s positioned in the Facitity for easy access in the event of a failure in the process. The worst case scenario and the release of a Vapor Cloud that detonated, the distance of the endpoint of a detonation is 0.5 miles. There are 30 homes in the blast radius. Involving and estimated 90 people. A ridge line on bothe side of the Facility will help absorb much of the explosion.        The Alternate release scenario involves a pull away explosion, caused by the truck failing to disconnect from the load out pumps. This woud cause a release of 4.5 gals of NGL or 17.5 lbs The scenario estimates a sudden realease and immediate shutdown with the aactive mitigatione system (snappy joe valves0. This gave us an alternate case scenario distance to the of overpressure endpoint of 1 psi of 0.2 mile radius of the Facility. This scenario distance brings 10 homes and 40 Residents into the radius.        The Facility is Being equiped with Hydrocarbon Leak Sensors to help avoid major releases We are governed by OSHA PSM STANDARDS AND OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119. The facility is also covered by CHK 14001. A EPA 40 CFR 112.7 SPCC is in place to preven, contain and control a hydrocarbon realease.   The Facility also complies with NFPA 58. In the event of a fire at the Facility, employees may respond to an incipient stage fire and the must evacuate theFacility. An EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN developed to 29 CFR 1910.38(a) is in place to establish procedures for the safe evacuation of the facility and summons emergency response organizations. The Facility has coordinated response with the local Fire Departments to respond to the Facility.",

      "SummaryText": "The Smokehouse Compressor Station, located in Logan Couny, WV, is a Natural Gas Dew Point Control facility. The facility is designed to process up to 15 Million Cubit Feet of Natural Gas per day.The Facility will be brought on line in late May or early June of 2009.                 Low pressure gas enters the Station from a greathering system (approximately 5 million cubit feet per day).The gas is then compressed to a pressure of 750 psig and sent to a Natural Gas Dew Point control plant. The gas is then cooled to 20 df and mixed with ethylene glycol to prevent freezing and remove water in the natural gas. The natural gas liquids (propane's plus C-3's) are then removed by the designed process of heat, cold and expanison. The Facility will product 1000/1500 gals of propane's plus per 1 million cubit feet of Natural Gas.     Ethane, Propane, N and Ifso Butane, N and Iso f Pentanes are regulated substances each with a TQ of 10,000 lbs.    With the  volume stored of regulated substances vs the trainsit gas stream, only the storage area was evaluted when determining the RMP eligibility Program Level. The interconnecting piping would make therefrigeration plant part of the process, but the requirements would not change in relation to the distance to the overpressure end point of one psi or resulting RMP Program Level.  There are 2 pressurized tanks, a storage of 30,000 gals each.              Worst Case Scenarios  We used RMP Comp and calcuated a mixture of Ethane, Propane, Butanes and Pentane's Plus to determine the worst case scenario distance of the Vapor Cloud explosion of 0.5 miles. This would effect 26 homes and 78 residents.  The alternate release scenario involves a Truck pullaway explosion' with the driver pulling away without diconnecting his hoses. This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the hose 4.1 gals or 17 lbs of lpg. This scenario estimates a sudden release and immcdiate shutdown with the active mitigation system (Snappy Joes Safety Val"
