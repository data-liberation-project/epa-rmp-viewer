Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Keota) are\n     committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and\n     propane.  Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's\n     job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement\n     appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an\n     accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action\n     Plan and is prepared to work with local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee\n     and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release\n     to employees, the environment, and general public.\n     \n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous  \n     ammonia is stored at the facility in two storage tanks of 12,800 gallons and 26,000 gallons.  These\n     tanks are located across the road from the office.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored in sixty-six\n     1000 gal wagons that are stored next to the storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous\n     ammonia would be 455,000 pounds.  Propane is stored in two storage tanks of 30,000 gallons and\n     11,800 gallons and they are located on the North edge of town.  The maximum quantity of Propane\n     would be 132,000 pounds.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total capacity, which is\n     controlled by a liquid level guage.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenerio.\n\n     a.     The wor"

The reviews identify the opportunity\n     for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards\n     used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.\n     The results of the reviews are documented and problems idenified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written procedures for the handling and storage of\n     anhydrous ammonia and propane.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the\n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.111,Storage and\n     Handling ofAnhydrous Ammonia.  The ANSI Standard has been adpoted by reference by Iowa\n     Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter43-Rule43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and handling of\n     anhydrous ammonia.  The applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58.  The written procedures\n     are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n     4) Training: All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training\n     program.  Training of all employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g. reading safety\n     information, operating procedures, response measures followed by a written test) and on-the-job\n     supervision.  All employees are trained annually.  The training program is reviewed by facility\n     management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.

The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable\n     in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  Corrective actions required\n     as a result of each compliance audit will be performed and documented.\n\n     7) Incident Investigation: Facility management will investigate each incident that results, or could have\n     reasonably resulted in a catastropic release of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  The investigation\n     will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to\n     prevent the release from reoccuring.  Investigation reports will be maintained for five years.     \n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past\n     five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the    \n     facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations,\n     sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.
