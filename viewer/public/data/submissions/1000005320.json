Preventative maintenance programs and systems are in place to reduce the potential for undesirable effects.  Emergency response plans and procedures are in place to handle problems if they arise.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) identifies potential release scenarios, safeguards and emergency response procedures.\n\nCVGP:  DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe CVGP is located just South of Cotton Valley, LA.  The plant processes natural gas and condensate.  Six systems process the incoming hydrocarbons; inlet separation and compression, condensate stabilization, amine system, dehydration, cryogenic system, and the fractionating train.  Regulated flammable materials in natural gas such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane are present at the plant.  Chemicals are utilized at the gas plant, however the type and quantity at the CVGP are not regulated as toxics under the RMP program.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for a worst case and alternative release scenarios for flammable substances, since the CVGP is a PSM-regulated, Program 3 facility.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario (WSC)\n\nThe WCS for a flammable release was determined to be a vapor cloud exposion of a pentane storage tank.  The safegaurds in place to prevent an accidental release from this tank make this release scenario far from probable. Regardless of the safety systems in place, the release scenario has been developed for the worst case \"what if\" scenario for the CVGP.  Under the RMP regulations, a WCS for flammable substances must consider a vapor cloud exposion event.  An end point based on a one psi overpressure is required.  A vapor cloud explosion involving the pentane tank could possibly affect a 0.56mile radius around the tank.  Four houses with a"

The safegaurds in place to prevent an accidental release from this tank make this release scenario far from probable. Regardless of the safety systems in place, the release scenario has been developed for the \"what if\" alternative scenario for the CVGP.    An end point based on a one psi overpressure is used.  A BLEVE involving the propane tank could possibly affect a 0.60 mile radius around the tank.\n\nFIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWith respect to flammables regulated under RMP, the CVGP has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  No offsite events occurred during this time period. The only onsite event occurred in 1997 and resulted in a contractor injury.  All events are investitgated to determine ways to mitigate accident potential. Appropriate steps are taken to maintain safe and environmentally sound operations.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nAn emergency response plan is maintained to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  This plan has been designed to address response to all emergencies including the WCS.  Response strategies include detailed procedures for notification of employees, management, responders, and the public of an emergency situation.  Communication, control of any releases, safety measures, and post incident recovery are included in the plan.  Phone numbers for medical facilities are included as well as pertinent MSDS that identify safety and medical information.\n\nThe plan has been coordinated with local response organizations such as the Webster Parish LEPC, the Cotton Valley Fire Department, and the Webster Parish Sheriff's Office.  The Cotton Valley Fire Department will coordinate fire department response.  The sheriff's office will contact residents in the area and control access to the site"

A schedule for performing emergency response drills as well as coordination of periodic drills with local responders is discussed in the plan.

However, safety policies and procedures are continually reviewed and updated in order to improve safety."
