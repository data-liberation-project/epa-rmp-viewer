              "Description": "To meet the requirements of Process Safety Management (PSM), Springdale Ice Cream and Beverage uses a comprehensive maintenance and Menchanical Integrity program for all critical process equipment. This program is in place to verify that all ammonia refrigeration equipment is designed and installed correctly, and operated safely and properly.  The program also establishes a formal procedure for training system operators to perform tasks associated with the ammonia system. A sound preventive maintenance program is vital tothe continued safe and efficient operation of the system. Therefore, we have established an ongoing, documented inspection and testing program. We conduct daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual inspections of all critical process equipment. \n\nFor safety and security purposes we have installed a video survellance camera outside the plant near the ammonia receiver.  A fence has been installed around the ammonia receiver and is locked to prevent unauthorized entry.  The perimeter of the property is also fenced.  \n\nTwenty-seven (27) Ammonia Sensors are located inside and outside the plant. All of the ammonia sensors are wired to a central alarm panel in the Engine Room. There are two (2) inside sensors with associated manual activation switches, that when activated, they turn on the emergency ventilation fans. There is also one (1) sensor and associated manual activation switch, that when activated, shuts down all ammonia compressors and closes the \"king\" valve.",
