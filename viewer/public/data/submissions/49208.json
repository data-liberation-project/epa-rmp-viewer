This plant is one of six water and wastewater plants operated by the City.  Wastewater plant # 2 and four other plants have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2 operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach, Florida Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2 accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68,  Prevention Program.\n1.1.1.MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach has a management system in place which is lead by the Utilities Director, which oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City wide and plant specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n1.1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2.  The program addresses each of  the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus  RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in the plant?s  OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained in The City of Atlantic Beach?s Document Management System (DMS).\n1.2.    THE CITY OF ATLANTIC BEACH STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE ATLANTIC B"

Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used as part of the treatment process. \n1.2.1.SITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Atlantic Beach.  The site is located at 739 Renault Drive, Atlantic Beach, Duval County, Florida.  The site is boarded by Mayport Road on the east, Regulus Road on the west, Renault Drive on the south and Wonderwood Road on the north.\nThe Plant includes a chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and distribution system contained in a specially designed storage and process building. The boundaries of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine and sulfur dioxide Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent make up and exhaust systems.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n1.2.2.REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\nChlorine is one of two regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The City of Atlantic Beach chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to two process control systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n1.3.WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (c)\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine"

The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that ?the ? shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minutes?  due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario?.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint.?  The EPA  selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The  3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, ?to estimate the population potentially affected.?\n1.3.1.    WORST CASE   (c)(1)\n    Atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions.  Results demonstrate a distance of ____ miles to the toxic endpoint.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at ____ people.\n1.3.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\n    The alternative release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one ton-containers. This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in either the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA?s PSM program and EPA?s RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City wide and Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2 site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  \n1.4.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. The overviews of these programs are listed below:\nThe City of Atlantic Beach has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \nThe DMS, document maintenance system, is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used. \nMaintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations, making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment. \nIncident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure we learn from each event as well as correct the causes of the incident. \nEmployees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed below under emergency response. \nSafe work practices are used throughout the facility including:  1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lock Out Tag Out Permits, 3) Vessel Entry Permits, 4) Site Security, and 5) Breaking Into Chemical lines. \nContractors must meet The City of Atlantic Beach?s high safety and technical standards as part of selection and ongoing evaluations.
