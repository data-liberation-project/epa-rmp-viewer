See Figure 2.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Result Summary\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario presented is similar to the worst case in that it is a liquid release.  The alternative release scenario chosen for this facility is that of a pipe leak.  It is assumed that this release is from the high side of the system.  The release scenario is assumed to last for 30 minutes, thereby incorporating active mitigation measures such as the emergency response procedures.  This would result in a loss of 3,540 lbs of ammonia.  Passive mitigation was not considered for the release, since the release could occur from ammonia equipment or piping located outside of building walls.\r\n\r\nEPA allows a facility to use typical meteorological conditions at the facility. For this scenario, a wind speed of 3 meters/second and neutral conditions, D stability, were used to find the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in an urban area.\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP*Comp was used for this calculation.  This release reaches 0.09 miles off site and may impact population receptors (commercial businesses).  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Alta Dena Dairy facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1994 Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the engine room, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, all of the ammonia is located inside the engine room or on the engine room roof (condensers).  The facility uses a heat transfer medium to provide cooling throughout the plant.\r\n\r\nAlta Dena Dairy's ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of th"

For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\r\n\r\nDETECTION AND MONITORING: One ammonia sensor is located in a key location in the facility (engine room). The facility in-house maintenance personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  If a leak is detected or observed by any Alta Dena Dairy employee (or contractor), it is immediately reported to their supervisor who then notifies the Maintenance Department in order to take action to mitigate the leak.\r\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: an emergency shut down button located outside the engine room that kills power to the engine room equipment (one outside each engine room door). The system can also be shut down electronically by the computer system. There are also relief valves on all pressure vessels and condensers and continuous ventilation in the engine room to prevent ammonia explosions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP Program defines accident as the following:\r\n\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\r\n\u00bf\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\r\n\r\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Hazard A"

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, CalARP, and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Alta Dena Dairy facility was built in 1997 and began operations in 1999.  The facility is located at 17851 East Railroad Street, City of Industry, California, which is just north of Highway 60 and approximately 5 miles east of Highway 57.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The system and the facility were constructed in accordance with 1994 Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 13,520 pounds of ammonia for the following three main purposes: To provide cooling for 1) dairy processing, 2) warehouse cold storage, and 3) HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) for offices.  With the exception of the condensers and the diffusion box (including associated piping), the entire ammonia system is located inside the engine room.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of ammonia from the thermosyphon receiver to the high pressure receiver.  The thermosyphon receiver also supplies ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  From the high pressure receiver, high pressure liquid ammonia is transferred to three accumulators (AC-1, AC-2 & AC-3) and 21&#61616;F Accumulator (AC-5) that maintain ammonia at different temperatures.  As the ammonia enters each accumulator/surge drum, it is expanded through a hand expansion v"

Each accumulator/surge drum supplies liquid ammonia to a distinct heat exchanger which provides cooling for one of the three purposes listed above, vaporizing the ammonia.  The heat exchangers are located in the engine room and use a secondary fluid (glycol and/or water) to provide the required cooling throughout the facility.\r\n\r\nThe vapor is returned to each accumulator/surge drum in which constant pressures are maintained by back pressure regulating valves.  The vapor from two of the accumulators (AC-1 & AC-2) and 21&#61616;F Accumulator (AC-5) is then pulled by the compressors (6) where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  Suction from the other accumulator (AC-3) is drawn to the Suction Accumulator (AC-4).  Designated compressor(s) pull high side suction from AC-4, while any residual liquid is sent back to the High Pressure Receiver via the liquid transfer unit.  Upon reaching a level set point in the transfer unit, hot gas discharge from the compressors pressurizes the vessel and the liquid is then returned to the high pressure receiver.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the four condensers where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the thermosyphon receiver.  An Auto Purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the high pressure receiver and the condensers.  The system also has a diffusion box (for equalizing pressure between vessels in the system), and a dilution tank (into which the relief header vents), which is kept full of water.  \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\r\n\r\nResult Summary\r\n\r\nAs part of this analysis, the EPA Toxic Endpoint (TE) for ammonia, 200 ppm, was used to quantify the off-site impact for the facility.

The population was estimated using 2010 census tract data.  Release information was calculated using RMP*Comp.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP requires that facilities also consider Environmental Receptors defined as: areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas.  There were no environmental receptors located within the furthest downwind distance of 0.90 miles.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The total ammonia charge consisted of 13,520 pounds of ammonia.  The largest vessel in the system, the High Pressure Receiver, can hold the entire ammonia charge, the entire ammonia charge of 13,520 pounds was assumed to be released. Note:  All vessels are located indoors; therefore, the release that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint is a mitigated release from the largest vessel.\r\n\r\nOnly the first 10 minutes of the release for solutions under ambient conditions is required for estimating the off-site consequences, because the toxic component in a solution evaporates fastest during the first few minutes of a spill, when its concentration is highest.  For the worst case scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and stable conditions (F class stability) were used, based on EPA requirements.  \r\nEPA's RMP*Comp was used to determine release rates and distances.  The worst case release reached 0.90 miles off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by"

To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.
