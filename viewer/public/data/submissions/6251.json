Oxy Vinyls, LP is a joint venture between Occidental Chemical Corporation (a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation) and The Geon Company.  The facility is located on the Houston Ship Channel at 4403 Pasadena Freeway.  It was originally constructed in 1960, has been expanded on four separate occasions, and currently employs 167 full-time employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (' 68.155(a)):\nOxy Vinyls is committed to operating the Pasadena PVC Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules/regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, Oxy Vinyls has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Pasadena PVC Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program for the Pasadena PVC Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the Pasadena PVC Plant consists of the following three elements:\n7 A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule;\n7 A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the covered processes containing, or with the potentia"

In fact, the Pasadena PVC Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, as well as safeguards to prevent injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nOxy Vinyls' policy on the use of hazardous substances:  Before using a hazardous substance at the Pasadena PVC Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered. When a hazardous substance is used, the plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance (which could adversely affect plant workers, the public or the environment) and take steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures, which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxy Vinyls strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility:  Oxy Vinyls implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Pasadena PVC Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines are also used when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each "

Oxy Vinyls' mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxy Vinyls' goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release:  In the event of an accidental release, the Pasadena PVC Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment. Oxy Vinyls utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. Oxy Vinyls trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  Oxy Vinyls also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office and at the Pasadena PVC Plant to assist workers, their families and the public during and after all emergencies.  In addition, the Pasadena PVC Plant actively works with CIMA (Channel Industries Mutual Aid), the Pasadena and Deer Park Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC's), and other local emergency service providers to help prevent and/or address injuries or environmental damage in case a release does occur.  The Pasadena PVC Plant, in conjunction with the East Harris County Manufacturers Association (EHCMA), has assisted the Pasadena LEPC in installation of the city wide emergency broadcast system and developed/implemented a RMP public communications plan.

The facility involves employees in designing, implementing and maintaining safety programs.  Safety is a primary concern in the facility and is demonstrated by the plant's selection in 1991 as the first OSHA Star Site on the Houston Ship Channel under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP); and OSHA Star re-certification was completed in 1994 and 1998.\n\nOxy Vinyls is an industry leader in the implementation of the Responsible Care.

The primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture, store and ship PVC resin.  Vinyl chloride is primarily delivered by pipeline, to two large storage spheres, from other Oxy Vinyls sites located in Deer Park, TX or LaPorte, TX.  However, at times and based on pipeline source limitations, vinyl chloride is delivered by railcars from other sources and unloaded into the same spheres.  The vinyl chloride is transferred from the spheres to charge tanks via pipeline; where it is then introduced into reactors.  In the reactor, vinyl chloride is polymerized to make polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin in a water slurry solution.  After drying, the PVC resin is then transferred and stored in silos until loaded into railcars for shipment to customers.\n\nThe facility and pipelines comply with the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. \n\n3.

Various sources (Landview, USGS maps, and DeLorme Street Atlas USA) and actual field surveying were used to estimate the number of people living within the endpoint distances, as well as the public and environmental receptors, of the scenarios.\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by the Pasadena PVC Plant:\n\n3.1 Toxic Substances - \nThere are no regulated toxic substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.\n\n3.2 Program 3 Processes - Flammable Substances\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for vinyl chloride is the catastrophic failure of one of the storage spheres, which would release 3,000,000 pounds of vinyl chloride in a 10-minute period and all safety systems fail, as mandated by EPA.  It is assumed that the vinyl chloride vaporizes within the 10-minute time period to form a vapor cloud.  The worst case release scenario then assumes a vapor cloud explosion.

For this scenario, the distance to a 1 psi overpressure would then be 0.056 mile (or 295 feet) for a vapor cloud explosion, per EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.\n\nThe residential population within the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for this alternate release scenario is zero.  In fact, it would barely get offsite, but could possibly affect an adjacent warehouse/office building at a plant site (Aristech) just north of the Pasadena PVC Plant.
