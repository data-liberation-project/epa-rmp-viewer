The process takes polystyrene pellets through an extrusion process where a nuclient and blowing agent (isopentane or butane) is added. The sheets are then thermoformed and cut to produce the final product.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the manufacturing process, isopentane and butane are stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified by EPA regulations. Genpak has one covered process that requires compliance with Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\r\n\r\nIsopentane and n-butane are delivered to the facility via tank truck. The tank truck is unloaded into a underground storage tank (isopentane) and above ground storage tank (n-butane) using a transfer pump.  A vapor recovery system prevents the release of vapors to the atmosphere during the transfer. Isopentane and n-butane are pumped separately from the storage tank to the pump room where the pressure is increased so it can be injected into one of the four extruders.\r\n\r\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Genpak\r\n\r\nGenpak is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Hazard Communication Plan, and Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\nSafety, environmental protection and risk management programs are implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\r\n\r\nC.

Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nGenpak will only respond to incidental releases of isopentane and butane where the release can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel. For non-incidental releases Genpak will rely on outside responders. Therefore, Genpak has coordinated response actions with the local fire department and ensured that appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response.\r\n\r\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nBased on operational knowledge from other facilities, Genpak believes that the existing safety program is adequate. However, if any changes occur in the future which affect the process, these changes will be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the safety of Genpak employees and neighbors is not compromised."
