The facility stores the chemicals in pressurized tanks and transfers them to and from various transportation modes including tank truck, rail car, barges, and ships.  The processes are storage and transfer only.  The storage and transfer currently only consist of flammable storage and transfer processes.\n\n\n\nThe systems for storage and transfer of other flammables and all toxics are the same basic design and use the same procedures.\n\n\n\nWe have identified the following flammable chemicals that have the potential to cause off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: isoprene, n-pentane and isopentane.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our co"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit procedure and contractor safety.\n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\n1.    All tanks that could store an RMP chemical are pressurized with two levels of pressure relief, with the first relieving to an abatement device at 80% of design pressure;\n\n2.    Temperature, pressure and level instrumentation include alarms;\n\n3.    All key parameters are monitored in a central control room;\n\n4.    All operations and maintenance employees are trained to the technician level of HAZWOPER; \n\n5.    Systems are pressure tested before chemicals are introduced;\n\n6.    Systems integrity is checked before and during each transfer; and\n\n7.    Systems integrity is checked at frequent intervals during static conditions both by sight, sound, and smell and an analyzer.\n\n8.    A central control room is used where all important parameters are monitored and alarmed on all tanks.  Logging of the parameter trends is also included allowing the parameter trend to be analyzed over a 30-day period.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilit"

Located throughout the terminal are portable fire extinguishers, rated ABC, that comply with OSHA and NFPA standards for portable fire extinguishers.  Hydrants and water hoses are located throughout the terminal and are available for hookup by the local fire department.  Furthermore, we coordinate our emergency response plans with all the local emergency planning commissions, of which OTC is an active member.\n\n\n\nSpill/release control equipment is located throughout the terminal.  The tank farm sits within a containment berm, the rail and tanker truck loading areas have spill pans which are plumbed to the wastewater treatment plant.\n\n\n\nProtective clothing is available for employees involved in any cleanup operations.  \n\n\n\nOTC has contracted with Moran Environmental Recovery (MER) and HEPACO to respond to spills/releases at their facility.  MER is nationally recognized for their emergency spill response capabilities.  Under the United States Coast Guard's (USCG) Oil Spill Removal Organization (OSRO) program, MER holds a WCD3 (Worst Case Discharge) classification in all Eastern Captain of The Port Zones.  Their spill response capabilities satisfy planning and response requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOTC utilizes the latest technology, including automated scales and meters to prevent overfills. In addition, OTC has implemented a certified management system that is audited and certified by a third party.  Also,"
