Logging of the parameter trends is also included allowing the parameter trend to be analyzed over a 30-day period.\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.

Located throughout the terminal are portable fire extinguishers, rated ABC, that comply with OSHA and NFPA standards for portable fire extinguishers.  Hydrants and water hoses are located throughout the terminal and are available for hookup by the local fire department.  Furthermore, we coordinate our emergency response plans with all the local emergency planning commissions, of which OTC is an active member.\r\n\r\nSpill/release control equipment is located throughout the terminal.  The tank farm sits within a containment berm, the rail and tanker truck loading areas have spill pans which are plumbed to the wastewater treatment plant.\r\n\r\nProtective clothing is available for employees involved in any cleanup operations.  \r\n\r\nOTC has contracted with Moran Environmental Recovery (MER) and HEPACO to respond to spills/releases at their facility.  MER is nationally recognized for their emergency spill response capabilities.  Under the United States Coast Guard's (USCG) Oil Spill Removal Organization (OSRO) program, MER holds a WCD3 (Worst Case Discharge) classification in all Eastern Captain of The Port Zones.  Their spill response capabilities satisfy planning and response requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90).\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nOTC utilizes the latest technology, including automated scales and meters to prevent overfills. In addition, OTC has implemented a certified management system that is audited and certified by a third party.  Also,"
