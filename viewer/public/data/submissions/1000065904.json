The\r\nfacility serves as a distribution point and processing plant for meat products that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets. Costco Wholesale is located at 7320 Lisbon Road, in Morris, Illinois. The facility is approximately 0.5 miles northwest of Highway 80. Morris is located approximately 55 miles southwest of Chicago. The immediate area is primarily\r\nurban. The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses ammonia for meat production operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage. Refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously. Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation. The majority of the system equipment is located in the ammonia engine\r\nroom as well as in the respective processing areas. The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof and the evaporators are placed in their respective cold storage areas.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the High Pressure Receiver / Thermosyphon Receiver which provides liquid feed to the High Temperature Recirculator (PR-3) and the Medium Temperature Recirculator (PR-4). The High Pressure Receiver / Thermosyphon Receiver also provides liquid feed to the compressors for thermosyphon oil cooling. The High Temperature Recirculator (PR-3) pumps high temperature liquid to the following equipment:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEvaporators (AU12 - AU23, AU31 - AU34, AU42 - AU55, AU66), \r\n\u00bf\tAir Handling Units (RTU1 - RTU4), \r\n\u00bf\tAmbient Dry Storage Evaporators (AU31 - AU34)\r\n\u00bf\tGlycol Heat Exchanger (GHX-4), \r\n\u00bf\tLow-Low Temperature Recirculator (PR-1), and \r\n\u00bf\tLow Temperature Recirculator (PR-2). \r\n\r\nThe High Temperature Recirculator receives return suction from these units, as"

Vapor rises to the top of the vessel and is pulled off by the High Stage Compressors (RC5 - RC8). \r\n\r\nThe Low Temperature Recirculator (PR-2) pumps liquid ammonia to the freezer evaporators (AU5 - AU11) and the Ice Makers (IM1 & IM2). \"Wet\" Suction from this equipment returns back to this same vessel. The vapor rises to the top of the vessel and is drawn off by the Booster Compressors (RCB3 - RCB5). \r\n\r\nThe Low-Low Temperature Recirculator (PR-1) pumps liquid ammonia to the Spiral Freezers (3 Units: Chub, Patty, & Meatball). There is a level column in the pipe that collects \"wet\" suction from this equipment. Vapor from this column is returned to the PR-1 via the wet suction return. As this fills with liquid ammonia, the pump is triggered to turn on along with a solenoid valve in the LTRS line and returns back to this same vessel. The vapor rises to the top of the vessel and is drawn off by the Booster Compressors (RCB1 & RCB2). \r\n\r\nThe Liquid Transfer Unit can transfer liquid from any of the four recirculators in the system (PR1 - PR4). Upon high level in a recirculator, the associated transfer solenoid valve is opened allowing flow of the excess liquid into the Liquid Transfer Unit. A transfer float at the Liquid Transfer unit will trigger the three-way valve to allow hot gas to pressurize the unit. The pressurized liquid is then dumpe"

In the event of over-pressurization, vessels\r\nwill vent to a common header which relieves to the Water Diffusion Tank until the system pressure\r\ndecreases sufficiently to reseat the valves. This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case\r\nthey become over pressurized.\r\n\r\nThe Costco Wholesale facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in\r\naccordance with the IIAR Standard 2 & ASHRAE-15 which specifically outline requirements for the safe\r\noperation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include a water diffusion tank,\r\nammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage and processing areas, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases. In addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to a water diffusion tank.\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nSince this is a new facility, there is no accident history to report. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.
