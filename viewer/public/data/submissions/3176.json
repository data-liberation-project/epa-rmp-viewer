FACILITY POLICY.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of FARMERS COOPERATIVE COMPANY; Lidderdale, IA, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the loacal fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmrs.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop porduction nutrients.\n\n   \n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in 30,000 gallons (1) and 18,000 gallons (1) storage tanks.  The maximum quantity stored would be 192,000 pounds.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n     a.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released wuold be 150,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design starnards.  The distance to the end point 2.4 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint  is 0.8 miles.\n\n4.   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institues, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  "

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.\n\n     there are no additional specific safety recommendations rgarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia and propane for implementation at this time."
