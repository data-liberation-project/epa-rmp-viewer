      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nIn accordance with provisions of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 of the Clean Air Act Amendments, the Knoxville Utilities Board?s (KUB?s) Risk Management Plan (RMP) is an integrated approach to identify and manage the hazards posed by an accidental chlorine release. KUB?S RMP is a unified program that integrates technologies, procedures and best management practices.  All applicable regulations, as required by EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention ? 40 CFR Part 68, are addressed in this Plan. The prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n?High level training for operators,\n?Effective preventive maintenance program,\n?Use of state of the art process and safety equipment,\n?Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with participation from the operators,\n?Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures, and\n?Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nFacility ID# 1000-0008-4963\nThe Fourth Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is an ?activated? secondary wastewater treatment plant with a dry weather design flow of 10.8 MGD.  The maximum chlorine storage capacity at this facility is 16,000 pounds.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nEach hazard assessment consisted of worst-case and alternative scenarios in order to evaluate the potential impacts of accidental releases of chlorine on the public health and environment. \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario \nFourth Creek uses chlorine in one (1) ton cylinders; therefore the worst-case scenario plant was based on the assumption that approximately 2000 pounds of chlorine would be released. All  calculations for air dispersion modeling was performed with RMP Comp Version 1.06 and results were mapped by using Landviewer 2000.  The worst-case scenario was evaluated at a release duration of 10 minutes and at a release rate of 110 pounds/minute.  Air dispersion modeling resulted in a distance to endpoint of 0.9 miles. Maps w"

      "SummaryText": "ith overlays depicting this scenario are included in the Offsite Consequence Analysis section of the plan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \nKUB?s process hazard analysis (PHA) indicated a chlorine release would most likely occur due to a failure in the chlorination system piping, therefore modeling for each alternative scenario was based on this assumption. The chlorine scrubber located at this plant was taken into consideration as active mitigation when conducting the alternative scenario. All calculations for the air dispersion modeling were performed with RMP Comp Version 1.06 and results were mapped by using Landviewer 2000. The alternative release scenario was evaluated at release duration of 10 minutes and at a release rate of 1630 pounds/minute. Modeling resulted in a distance to endpoint of 0.5 miles. Maps with overlays depicting this scenario are included in the Offsite Consequence Analysis section of the plan.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nIn addition to the off-site consequence analysis, a five (5) year accident history was compiled for Fourth Creek.  In the past five years there have been no accidents related to chlorine releases.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nKUB?s accidental release prevention program is based upon OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and addresses the following 10 elements tailored to our facility's operations. The Plan, in its entirety, can be reviewed in Plant Operations and in Technical Services. In accordance with the Process Safety Management provisions incorporated into the Risk Management Program, KUB promotes prevention programs in each of the major areas listed below: \n\n?Management System\n?Employee Training\n?Prestartup Safety Review\n?Management of Change\n?Process Hazard Analysis\n?Process Safety Information\n?Standard Operating Procedures \n?Compliance Audits\n?Incident Investigation\n\nACTIVE MITIGATION SYSTEMS\nThe chlorine scrubber system is a once-through, three-stage absorption system designed to contain and safely evac"

      "SummaryText": "uate a major chlorine leak while maintaining toxic vapor emissions below the Uniform Fire Code requirement of 1/2 the IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value at all times.  To accomplish this, the scrubber removes >99.99% of the toxic vapor in the air while maintaining a negative pressure in the chlorine storage room.  The scrubber system consists of  three horizontal cross-flow packed bed sections. The caustic storage tank is an integral part of the system and is located below the scrubber adsorber sections. The recirculation pump pulls caustic solution from the storage tank and circulates it through the 3 stages, allowing the vapor-laden gases to be absorbed into the caustic and discharging vapor-free air through the stack.  Other safeguards in the system to prevent an accidental release are the use of a chlorine vapor detector, exhaust fans and emergency alarms.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nKUB?s Emergency Response Program is based upon the Chlorine Institute?s ?Pamphlet 64 - Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities? and is designed to address the specific emergency needs associated with a chlorine leak. Even though Fourth Creek Plant has mitigation systems to minimize the likelihood of a release, KUB has a comprehensive emergency response plan that is complete, up-to-date and supplemented with emergency response training and drills for employees. \n\nKUB?s Plan has been submitted to and reviewed by the City of Knoxville Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC). In the event of an off-site release, the Plan prepares KUB and the Community for a response to and mitigation of accidental chlorine releases in order to limit the severity of such releases and their impact on both public health and environment.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nKUB has recently implemented a work management system called the Mincom Information Management System (MIMS).  Use of this system will help assure that all chlorine feed systems, including emergency monitoring"

      "SummaryText": " systems, are properly maintained.  Preventive maintenance work orders will be generated automatically and routed to the designated crew.  In addition MIMS will easily track and record the use of all KUB equipment (trucks, lab equipment, chlorine cylinder repair kits, emergency response equipment) and schedule service appointments periodically to ensure that employees are using the most reliable equipment for each task. \n\nThe visual workplace (5S) is one of the fundamental techniques KUB has adopted in a an effort to adopt a continuous improvement philosophy. Visual workplace 5 -S provides a method by which employees improve workplace safety, reduce waste, simplify work processes, improve equipment maintenance and troubleshooting, and ensure continuous improvement.  Using the 5-S methodology,  the employees transform their work areas by use of easy to access visual systems based on these 5-S concepts:\n\n-Sort (Organization) \n?Simplify (Orderliness) \n?Shine (Cleanliness) \n?Standardize \n?Sustain (Self Discipline) \n\nOne of the most innovative safety approaches in KUB?s 2-year safety plan is the appointment of a KUB-wide Safety Team that will utilize the Dupont ?STOP? program. The members of the Safety Team will work with department managers, supervisors and employees to standardize departmental safety programs, coordinate resources, and communicate safety goals and initiatives."
