      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Buena Vista Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the Buena Vista Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004, and June 2009.  This RMP is the five-year update of the June 2009 RMP.  The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs in 1999 and 2004 because Buena Vista Chlorination Station is not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. However, in the excess of caution, the LADWP decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP in 2009. Thus, this 2014 update of the 2009 RMP also demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n\n\n?

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nThe above information for the Buena Vista Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe LADWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable requirements of the State of California and the EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and the CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Buena Vista Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Buena Vista Chlorination Station has a good record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Buena Vista Chlorination Station is located at 1561 North Broadway in Los Angeles, California.  The plant is situated between the Pasadena Freeway and Broadway, west of the Los Angeles River, in the Elysian Park area of Los Angeles. This facility chlorinates two reservoir outlet pipelines leaving Elysian Reservoir before being distributed to the public water supply. The station consists of a container "

The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and the CalARP Program rules. A maximum of nine one-ton chlorine containers can be stored at the Buena Vista Chlorination Station. These chlorine containers are connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas.  The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) online. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Buena Vista Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unoccupied and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.  Thus, the LADWP Buena Chlorination Station is not subject to the federal or the California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\n\n\nA maximum of four one-ton chlorine containers are manifolded in two banks of two containers to supply chlorine.  These four containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and will close the valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 parts per million (ppm) is detected in the room. The facility has two additional one-ton containers, which rest on load cell scales. Thus, all the six containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight in these six containers.  There are trunnions for storage of three additional full or empty ton containers without process connections.\n\nChlorine gas is withdrawn from a bank of containers through pigtails, which are attached to the ton container gas valves.  The chlorine flows under pressure to a chlorine header then to the automatic switchover vacuum regulating valves with check-relief unit.  The switchover "

      "SummaryText": "valves are triggered by the rise in vacuum pressure in the chlorine feed line between the switchover valve and the chlorinator.  The rise in vacuum occurs when the chlorine container pressure approaches zero, which happens when the container is empty.  If this occurs, the switch-over valve will open the alternate chlorine connection, demanding chlorine gas from the alternate chlorine containers.  The chlorine gas then leaves the switchover valve under vacuum to two of the three chlorinators.  From the chlorinators, the gaseous chlorine travels under vacuum to the injectors. It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released and the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve.\n\n\n\nIn the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high pressure water supply to form a chlorine solution, which then travels to diffuser tubes located in the pipelines.  Residual chlorine analyzers monitor residual chlorine in the pipelines downstream of the diffusers and provide feedback control for subsequent chlorine dosing.\n\nMultiple chlorine leak detectors have been installed inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.\n\n\n\nThe Buena Vista Chlorination Station has a main caustic solution scrubber actuated by the chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm that can neutralize up to 4,000 lb of chlorine. \n\n\n\nA dry media chlorine \"mini-scrubber\" unit (MS) has also been installed at the Buena Vista Chlorination Station.

The chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.  In addition, a diesel emergency generator is available for the operation of the chlorine scrubber in the event of power outages.\n\n\n\nThe facility is normally unoccupied; water treatment operators visit the facility daily. A response team coordinated from the LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms that may occur.

The LADWP provides information and explanations concerning the hazards and processes. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nThe LADWP has procedures in place to ensure that a pre-startup safety review is conducted prior to starting a new covered process or prior to making modifications to the chlorination systems that require a Management of Change (MOC) procedure implementation.  The required conditions prior to startup include the following:\n\n\n\n?    Construction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications.\n\n?    Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.\n\n?    A PHA has been performed for new facilities and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup.\n\n?    At modified facilities, MOC requirements have been met.\n\n?    Training of each operating and maintenance employee involved in the process is complete.\n\n\n\nThese procedures ensure that no new and/or significantly modified process will startup and no regulated substances will be introduced into such a process before the pre-startup safety review.  This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to go and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately addressed.  This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process is safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate it. \n\n\n\nMechanical integrity procedures for the plant ensure that written maintenance procedures are implemented and documented, including training"

Description of the work to be performed is included with the printed work order.  The water treatment supervisors are responsible for the maintenance of the chlorination system.  \n\nIn addition, the written maintenance procedure is provided in the O&M Manual as follows: Preventive maintenance schedules are provided which summarize inspection, test, and maintenance schedules on a daily, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, biannual, and annual every 2 to 10 years, and on as-needed basis.  These procedures allow the operator to rapidly review what maintenance is necessary.  The schedules are supplemental to the log sheets onsite and provide a summary and quick reference to manufacturer's O&M manuals.  A maintenance log book is provided onsite for Operator quick reference.\n\nThe LADWP documents inspection, testing, and maintenance of chlorination equipment and assures the performance is performed in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer and industry groups (i.e., Chlorine Institute).\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nHot work refers to work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark producing operations.  The hot work procedures require the issuance of a hot work permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorination process and other areas deemed appropriate as described in these procedures.  Fire prevention and protection systems are in place before a hot work permit is issued. The permit indicates the dates the work is authorized for, the location, and specific operational requirements, and it is kept on file in the administrative office. \n\n\n\nThe LADWP Management of Change procedures include steps required t"

Starting June 2009, the LADWP certified compliance with Program 3 Prevention Program requirements. The two most recent audit reports and a list of the recommendations are retained in the LADWP's files.\n\nThe compliance audit consists of separating the RMP program elements or sections, and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness.  For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance Audit Checklist.  The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader.  The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element and contains questions that may assist with the auditing process. The audit checklist for each element consists of the following three sections:\n\n\n\n?    Records Review: A review of the RMP written Prevention Program.\n\n?    Onsite Conditions: The audit team reviews the program elements based on observation of the plant conditions and safety practices.\n\n?

A number of equipment and procedural changes were made as part of the implementation of the recommended actions. All the above recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the LADWP, including the installation and operation of a dry media chlorine mini-scrubber. Additionally, five recommendations to further improve chlorine safety were identified in February 2014, when the PHA was reviewed for the facility. Based on the 2014 seismic assessment, no additional recommendations were made for the Buena Vista Chlorination Station. It is expected that all the recommendations will be evaluated by December 2014 and implemented by June 2015. The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorination system.\n\n"
