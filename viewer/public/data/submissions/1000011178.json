Knead Dough Bakery, Inc.'s senior management is committed to offer superior service, and maintains a safety and environmental program to promote proper working conditions for all its employees and the surrounding community. Knead Dough Bakery, Inc. administers safety and environmental policies at the facility to ensure compliance with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RMP). These programs include employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations. These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia among other safety concerns.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nKnead Dough Bakery, Inc. is located at 556 St. James Gate, in Bolingbrook, Illinois. The systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. The facility's two systems use just over 20,000 pounds of ammonia. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors. The condensers are located outside the engine room, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Knead Dough Bakery, Inc. ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features, much of which is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems. For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nPolicies and procedures ensure safe practices are being performed.

Other safety features include: ammonia sensors that sound a facility wide alarm, an emergency shutdown button that kills power to the engine room equipment, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and ventilation in the engine rooms to prevent ammonia explosions.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility has based its maintenance program on the industry standard: the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\" is used at the facility.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the Knead Dough Bakery, Inc. facility accident history revealed that there have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (April 2010 through April 2015) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. In addition, there were no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nKnead Dough Bakery, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan in effect at the facility. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1) Save lives;\n\n2) Minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n3) Protect the environment; and\n\n4) Minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nKnead Dough Bakery, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. The Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANG"
