This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.    Should an accidental release occur, P Chem, Inc. has worked with the local fire department so they can plan for a response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:  P Chem, Inc. primary activities are chemical manufacturing.  We have 3 regulated substances at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous) and Formaldehyde(solution), and cyclohexylamine. Ammonia is stored at our facility in quantities greater than the threshold limits.  It is used for phosphonic acid production and neutralizations.  Formaldehyde (solution) is stored at our facility in quantities greater than the threshold limits.  It is used for phosphonic acid and triazine production.  Cyclohexylamine is stored in quantities greater than the threshold limit.  It is used for alkyl amine production.\n\n3.  Worst Case Release Scenario/and the Alternative-Case Scenario:\n  P Chem, Inc. has developed a worst-case and alternative \u00bfcase scenario however it has been withheld form this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by the EPA.\n\n4.  Accident Release Program:  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that i"

Anhydrous Ammonia is stored and handled in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111.  \n\nProcess Safety Management\nP Chem, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nP Chem, Inc. conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these  analysis is FMEA.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.    Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA update was performed 12-19-07.\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, P Chem, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all personnel involved in the processes.\n\nTraining:\nP Chem, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nP Chem, Inc. carries out documented maintenance checks on process and storage equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; process vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance p"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely matter.\n\nPre-startup Review:\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at P Chem, Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nP  Chem, Inc. has procedures in place for investigating any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective action to prevent the release from reoccurring.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nP Chem, Inc. believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors:\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  P Chem, Inc informs the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00bfs work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History:  P Chem, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no  reportable accidental release during"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, our plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  \nLatexo Volunteer Fire Department is the local Emergency Response with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at P Chem, Inc.  Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations for anhydrous ammonia,cyclohexylamine, or formaldehyde processes for implementation at this time."
