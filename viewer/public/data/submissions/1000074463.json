      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\n\n\nThe Linde Decatur facility, owned and operated by Linde PLC is located at 900 Linde Lane, Decatur, AL 35061. The management and employees of the Decatur facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous Ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe facility's primary operations are the production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide where the covered material, anhydrous ammonia, is used as a non-reducing agent to control emissions in the flue gas of the SMR. Ammonia is also used in the refrigeration system of the carbon dioxide facility; however, this is below the threshold of 10,000 lb. Ammonia is received and stored in a high pressure receiver and process system that contains up to 39,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nWorst case scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA definition for a toxic gas release and the alternative release scenarios were conducted and endpoints were determined using PHAST Professional, Version 5.1. Description and results may be reviewed by contacting the facility.\n\nMitigation systems\n\n\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems are in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties. The system is also located within an enclosure.\n\n\n\nPrevention program:\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Ammonia. The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation. Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements. They are frequently consulted concerning the various a"

This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of ammonia. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA is reviewed and updated as needed every five years.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures:\n\nDetailed operating procedures exist, which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, and safety and health precautions to be taken. The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process. The operating procedures are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\n\n\nEmployee training:\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees. The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA's hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200. Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures, routine and non-routine work authorization and other pertinent process safety information. Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on job duties. The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms. Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their s"

Employees are encouraged to actively participate. The employees are periodically evaluated to ensure they possess the necessary skills and knowledge via a computer based system called Traccess, which includes written tests, observation and/or oral interviews.\n\n\n\nContractor screening:\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public. The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience. In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. Linde outsources \"Contractor\" pre-qualification work to a third-party company called BROWZ. BROWZ has been chosen over a number of other companies that provide this type of service. BROWZ clients include other major chemical and manufacturing companies besides Linde.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup safety reviews:\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality standpoint. The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained. The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters.\n\n\n\nMechanical integrity program:\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations."

The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer's recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.\n\n\n\nHazardous or non-routine work:\n\nHazardous work or non-routine work is controlled in a consistent manner. The hazards identified are communicated to those performing the work and to operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process. The Linde Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work. The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures. Linde's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage its employees/contractors in performing this type of work.\n\n\n\nManagement of change:\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities. MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes. This would include both technical and mechanical changes. Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind.\" A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.\n\n\n\nProcess incidents - Five year "

The purpose of the incident investigation is to identify the underlying causes of the incident and to implement corrective action to prevent similar incidents and avoid past mistakes. Process incidents are investigated by a Team which include both management and employees and is multidisciplinary. An incident report is prepared following the investigation which includes the findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The Facility Manager is responsible for ensuring that all report recommendations are completed or resolved by those individuals responsible for follow-up. All resolutions are communicated to all affected employees.\n\nThere have been no Incidents/Accidents in the past five years involving the covered substance/Process.\n\n \n\nEmergency action plan - EAP:\n\nThe facility has an emergency preparedness/response plan. The plan outlines what actions employees are to take in the event of an ammonia release. The plan complies with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and has been integrated with local emergency response agencies.\n\nAll employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work. The plan is tested and critiqued twice a year to ensure that it is current. Changes are made and reviewed if deficiencies are found. The site does not have trained Emergency Responders at the technician level but Linde maintains trained technician level Emergency Responders on 24-hour call throughout the U.S.\n\n\n\nCompliance audit:\n\nThe facility receives a Compliance Audit in accordance with EPA Risk Management Standard Part 68 at least once every three years.
