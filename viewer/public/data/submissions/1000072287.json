The field gas stream enters the MRU to condense the liquids in a closed loop system by physical separation and cryogenic means. Once the NGLs are condensed to approximately 25 degrees, then the liquids flow to the any of the four pressurized storage tanks onsite. These tanks are a part of the closed loop system. From there, the NGLs will be loaded out via truck.\r\n\r\nThe stored NGL product is considered a flammable mixture of methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n butane, iso-pentane, and n-pentane (C1-C5), with the primary components being propane and n-butane. In addition to the NGL storage from the MRUs, the site will have propane storage."

      "SummaryText": "Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC owns and operates upstream and midstream assets in over 506,000 net acres of the Williston Basin for the Bakken, Three Forks and other horizons. It is an independent exploration and production company focused on the acquisition and development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources from an integrated perspective. Companies such as Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC play a vital role in the global oil and gas industry as it is at the forefront of technology deployment, operational efficiencies, and infrastructure development.  \r\n\r\nOasis Midstream Partners serves as a fundamental business that takes natural gas and crude oil retrieved in the upstream sector to the downstream processing facilities.  Thus, supporting activities that take place after the initial production phase and through to the point of sale. \r\n\r\nOasis Midstream Partners (OMP) will operate the applicable facility titled the Forland 5198 41-33 HL Central Tank Battery (Forland) in McKenzie County, North Dakota.  Forland's purpose is to extract natural gas liquids (NGLs) from the field gas gathered from the nearby area of the Bakken Shale Formation. This extraction will be done using Mechanical Refrigeration Unit (MRU) skids. Additionally, the site will have propane storage. The facility's location is approximately 3.8 miles north-northeast of Watford City in McKenzie County, North Dakota.\r\n\r\nThe Forland location is required to develop and implement a proper Risk Management Program (RMP) to mitigate risk under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation for Chemical Accident Release Prevention (40 CFR 68).  This requirement is fulfilled with the onset of the listed chemicals (as identified onsite) above their individual threshold quantities.  As a Program 1 Level facility, it has been determined that the site is subject to the regulation and the covered processes will not affect the public in a worst-case release scenario.
