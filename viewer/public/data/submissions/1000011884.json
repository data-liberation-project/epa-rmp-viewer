      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nAbsorbent Technologies, Inc Manufacturing Facility\n140 Queen Avenue, SW\n\nIntroduction\nAbsorbent Technologies, Inc. (ATI), based in Beaverton, Ore., develops and manufactures starch-based soil amendments (Zeba brand) that help improve plant and crop quality and yield for the agriculture and nursery industry, with less water and more efficient use of other inputs. When introduced into the soil, Zeba products absorb a tremendous amount of water and slowly releases over a long period of time.\n \nBetween 1996 and 2002, ATI conducted an extensive research program to develop the starch-based polymers technologies.  During 2003, ATI opened up the Product Development Center located at 2830 Ferry Avenue, SW, Albany, Oregon. This pilot plant conducted runs to further refine the process. This facility is still in operation to further refine the process. During 2004, ATI started construction of a full scale manufacturing facility located at 140 Queen Avenue, SW, Albany, Oregon, which is the site this RPM is being developed for. In 2009 ATI finished construction on the front-end process at the full scale manufacturing facility developing starch-based co-polymer. Construction of the tail-end \"dewatering\" process is scheduled for 1st quarter 2010.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAbsorbent Technologies, Inc. is committed to the safety of its workers and the public along with the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. It was ATI's philosophy to design the acrylonitrile (AN) storage and dispensing system with the latest in control systems, secondary containment enclosures and scrubbing systems. In addition to these mechanical prevention measures, ATI has operator training programs, preventative maintenance procedures and programs to evaluate hazards.\n\nIn the unlikely event of an accidental release, ATI has included secondary containment systems that that would contain a liq"

A vapor release of AN from a valve or pump leak will be captured in one of six exhausted enclosures that are ducted to two scrubbers. A large spill in the secondary containment area would be blanketed with foam to greatly reduce evaporation.\n\nATI provides emergency response training to all plant personnel, has a designated emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities and coordinate response efforts with response contractors and the local fire department.\n\nIn order to implement these policies, ATI has established a management system directed by ATI's President & Chief Executive Officer.\n\n \nFacility and Regulated Substances\nThe regulated substance will be acrylonitrile (AN). It is used for manufacturing at the facilities located at 140 Queen Avenue, SW and 2830 Ferry Street, SW. The first phase in the construction of the manufacturing facility, completed January 2006, was the installation of a 20,000-gallon AN storage tank, AN truck unloading area and portable AN tank filling station. 40 CFR Part 68 lists the threshold quantity for acrylonitrile at 20,000 pounds. The AN storage tank, at times, contains over 135,000 pounds of AN thereby triggering the original development of this Risk Management Plan.  ATI receives periodic tanker truck deliveries to the 20,000-gallon storage tank. ATI then fills 260-gallon portable tanks that will be transferred to Product Development Center for use in the Pilot Plant. \n\nPhase Two was the construction of the front-end of the manufacturing process at the Queen Avenue facility, completed October 2009. During this step of manufacturing process, AN is mixed with a starch/water solution and pumped to the graft reactor.  The material goes to a blender where the starch and all of the AN is transformed into a co-polymer called \"dough\". The dough is then be transported to the Product Development Center to be processed into a finished produ"

      "SummaryText": "ct. Development and construction of the co-polymer production line added a process in which the acrylonitrile was involved, triggering a addition and resubmission to the Risk Management Plan at this facility.\n\nThe RMP currently covers all Phase 1 and Phase 2 operations involving acrylonitrile.\n\nPhase Three will be the installation of the second stage processing equipment. The schedule for the completion of this phase has not yet been established at this time. This phase will not require any modifications to the RMP as there is no acrylontirile involved in these processes.\n\n\nAccidential Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \nThe design of the acrylonitrile (AN) storage tank, piping systems and portable tank filling system was developed with safety as the top priority. The tanker truck is top unloaded and all the piping is double walled. The hose connections are the DryLoc and CamLoc types to prevent spills. The storage tank is double walled protected tank, which means it is bulletproof. There are no valves on the tank that are located below the liquid level. The tank vent is routed back to the top of the truck, which also would be the route if the tank were to be overfilled. The tank has over pressure relief valves, which vent to a carbon scrubber. The tanker truck unloading area has secondary containment that will hold the contents of the truck. There is also a sump in the containment area that contains a high volume pump that will transfer spilled AN to an emergency holding tank. The sump is also connected to the secondary containment for the storage tank. There is also an emergency generator that will supply power to the controls, alarms and pumps in the event of a power failure.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specification Prevention Steps:\n\nThe design of the acrylonitrile (AN) storage tank, piping systems, pump house, graft reactor and portable tank filling system were all developed with safety as the top priority"

AN vapor sensors are located in the enclosures exhaust ducting, which will quickly detect a leak, stop all pumping, and sound an alarm. All of these enclosures are vented back to the carbon scrubber. All tanks, pipes, valves, enclosures and pumps are within the 38,000-gallon concrete containment area. All tanks are equipped with level gauges and high level alarms. There are several fire detection sensors located throughout the containment area that will activate a foam suppression system. This system will not only extinguish a fire but will also inhibit the vaporization of the AN. \n\nPrior to filling the portable tank, they are placed inside an enclosure that has secondary containment and is exhausted to the carbon scrubber.
