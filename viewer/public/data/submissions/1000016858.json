All inspections are performed per International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Bulletin 109.  To assure the longevity of the process, we have also developed and implemented a Management of Change program.  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are performed as needed.\n\tCompliance Audits are conducted every three years to ensure our ongoing compliance with regulations.  We have also instituted procedures for Incident Investigations, Employee Participation, and Contractor Safety.\n\tDevelopment, implementation, and documentation of the entire plan is the responsibility of the Plant Manager.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\tBCD Storage has not had an accidental release nor any incident that could have resulted in the release of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\tBCD Storage has developed an emergency response program to ensure: Employee safety, Notification of agencies, and informing the general public.  This plan includes a chain of command, evacuation procedures, a notification list, and First Aid for exposure to either liquid or gaseous ammonia.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\tNo additional changes are planned at this time."

As such, we recognize our responsibility to ensure the refrigeration system is run safely for the protection of our employees, our neighbors, and the environment.  To this end, we have conducted several in-depth studies (including Process Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits) to assure we are both in compliance with regulations and operating as safely and efficiently as possible.  \n\tAll refrigeration system operators are fully trained in their duties prior to assignment to prevent accidental releases or incidents that could cause a release.  In addition, all facility employees have been trained per our emergency response program should an emergency situation arise.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\tThe facility at BCD Storage, LLC was constructed in 1970 and has undergone a few modifications to make it more efficient.  The most recent modification was performed in 2000.  The system consists of: a high pressure receiver (capable of holding 60,200# of ammonia); three evaporative condensers; five compressors; a glycol chiller; refrigeration coils; and numerous recirculation accumulators and evaporators (In individual cold rooms). The system is charged with 48,830# of anhydrous ammonia, our only regulated substance.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\tTo ensure the ongoing safety of our facility, we have instituted a Process Safety Management program.  We have compiled written process safety information that includes the hazards of the process, the technology being utilized and detailed information on our equipment.  We conduct a Process Hazard Analysis every five years, ensuring to track all recommendations to closure.  All operators assist in the annual review of our operating procedures to ensure that both the SOPs are accurate,"
