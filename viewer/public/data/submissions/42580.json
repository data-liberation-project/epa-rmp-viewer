      "SummaryText": "1.1  Introduction to the RMP Update\nEl Dorado Energy, LLC has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) Update for the El Dorado Energy Facility in Boulder City, Nevada in accordance with 40CFR68.190 of the federal RMP regulations.  In accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the update has been prepared within 5 years of the date of the original submittal.  The plan was originally submitted to the Administering Agency, the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) in September 1999.\n\nThe federal RMP regulations require periodic updating of the RMP program information, but do not require that the entire plan be recreated in its\u00bf entirety.  In fact, the RMP regulations require that many of the program documents be retained for the life of the plan.  The RMP is expected to change and evolve as the facility changes, as new information on chemical hazards is developed, as the affected system is modified, and as the surrounding community changes.  In some instances, new program elements supersede previous versions; in other cases, the new program element supplements the previous version.  To ease the administrative burden for the facility, the previous version of the RMP is incorporated by reference into this RMP update.\nThe following activities were conducted in support of the RMP Update, in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP guidance for updates:\n\n\u00bf  A compliance audit was conducted by an outside environmental contractor.  Any deficiencies noted during the audit were addressed in this RMP update.  [Note: This facility is a Program 1 facility, and is not required to conduct the formal 3-year compliance audit required of Program 2 and 3 facilities.  The Compliance Audit Checklist was completed as a convenient means of verifying complaince with those aspects of the RMP program that the facility is subject to.]\n\u00bf  The Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) was revised using a current version of RMP*CompTM.

This program is implemented under the Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) of the Bureau of Waste Management (BWM) \u00bf Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP).\nThe scope of the RMP is based on discussion with NDEP and the Boulder City Fire Department to ensure that all issues are resolved and to incorporate state requirements.  The aqueous ammonia storage and handling process at the El Dorado Energy facility was identified as the only process that triggers the RMP/CAPP requirements.  This process is covered under the Tier B, program level 1 requirements, as defined, based on the storage of 15,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia with an ammonia concentration of 28 percent by weight.  There have been no changes to the facility or regulated process that would affect the RMP program level for this RMP update.\n\n1.3  Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\nEl Dorado Energy has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  El Dorado Energy is committed to operating and maintaining all of the processes in a safe and responsible manner.  El Dorado Energy has implemented a combination of accident release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to employees, the public, and the environment."

The El Dorado Energy facility is located approximately 15 miles southwest of Boulder City Nevada.  It is an electric generating station consisting of two combustion turbine generators with a combined maximum nominal gross output of 475 megawatts (MW).  Both turbines burn pipeline quality sweet dry natural gas exclusively.  They are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems for the control of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.  The SCRs employ ammonia injection technology that reduces NOx the targeted level of 3.5 ppmvd (at 15 percent O2).  The ammonia source for the SCRs is aqueous ammonia with an ammonia concentration of 28 percent by weight.\n\nThere have been no significant changes to the ammonia storage and handling system since the development of the original RMP.  However, with this RMP update, additional system details are provided for the regulated process.  The ammonia storage and handling system at El Dorado Energy is comprised of a single storage tank, pumps, piping, and a vaporizer.  Following the vaporizer, there are two blowers (one for each SCR) that deliver the vaporized ammonia stream to the SCRs.  \n\nThe tank is a horizontally-oriented tank, rounded on each end.  The tank is constructed of carbon steel which is compatible with aqueous ammonia.  The tank has a total capacity of 16,400 gallons and is equipped with pressure relief valves, a flame arrestor, and temperature, pressure and level indicators.  The maximum capacity of the tank is administratively limited to 15,000 gallons.\nThe tank is installed within a concrete secondary containment structure.  The containment structure has a surfa"

The total containment capacity is 35,900 gallons.The piping from the tank to the vaporizer is also carbon steel, 1 to 2 inches in diameter, depending on the service.\n\n1.5  Offsite Consequence Analysis\nIn light of security concerns, and consistent with EPA policy, discussion of the OCA has been omitted from the Executive Summary.  \n\n1.6  Compliance Audit\nThe RMP program for El Dorado Energy was audited by ENSR Corporation.  The audit was based on EPA\u00bfs recommended audit protocol and ENSR conducted a site visit to verify that the site conditions were as described in the RMP program documents.  Based on the audit, ENSR concluded that there were no significant non-compliant aspects of the RMP.  ENSR did note two minor issues with the RMP, while not significant, should be corrected.  These issues are:\n\u00bf  The temperature used to develop the original OCA, while based on the default condition of 77 F specified in the federal RMP rule, does not represent the worst-case condition that might occur at this facility.  The OCA was revised to reflect the higher average July temperature representative of the site. \n\u00bf  The process and equipment description lacked specific details of the system design, such as materials of construction, working pressures, temperatures, and flow rates.  The original RMP also incorrectly described the affected process as terminating at the ammonia vaporizer, rather than at the point of injection.  \n\n1.7  5-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents involving the release of aqueous ammonia since the facility opened in 1999.\n\n1.8  Emergency Response Program\nThere have been no significant changes to El Dorado Energy facility\u00bfs emergency response program since the RMP was originally developed in 1999.  Based on the accident history and compliance audit, no changes are recommended at this time.  \nEl Dorado Energy facility\u00bfs emergency response program includes the following core elements:\n\u00bf"
