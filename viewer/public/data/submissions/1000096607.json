In this system, high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to multiple accumulators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator feeds either bunker mounted or ceiling suspended evaporator coils located throughout the facility. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temp"

      "SummaryText": "eratures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator. Any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Operation of a three-way solenoid valve causes the refrigerant to increase in pressure so that it can be returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the screw compressors.\n\n\n\nThe system also includes a direct expansion (DX) ceiling suspended evaporator coil. In a DX evaporator, high pressure liquid is supplied from the high pressure receiver directly to the evaporator. The evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporator. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporator and is returned to the main suction accumulator.\n\n\n\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to an evaporative condenser where it is cooled and liquefied. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating. \n\n\n\n1.2."

      "SummaryText": "3 Safety Systems\n\n\n\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment. All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves. The high side of the system relieves at 250 or 300 psig while the low side of the system relieves at 150 or 250 psig. All pressure relief valves vent to the atmosphere. \n\n\n\nThe main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressor.\n\n\n\nThe emergency pressure control system was installed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 and the 2016 California Fire Code.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Pressure Control System (EPCS) operates as follows: \n\nEPCS is activated at not greater than 90% pressure relief valve setting (e.g. 270 psig or less) [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.3] \n\nUpon activation, all compressors are stopped by a means that is independent of all other safety controls [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.6] \n\nUpon activation, cross-over valve is opened [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.6] \n\nUpon activation, a signal is provided to personnel responsible for refrigeration system maintenance [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.7] \n\nEPCS remains active until manually reset [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.8]\n\nEPCS crossover isolation valves are locked open [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.4.2] \n\n\n\nThe emergency pressure control system is seldom used in a refrigeration system, but has been installed for rare emergency situations.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Process Classification\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Porterville Citrus Rayo consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nPorterville Citrus Rayo has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Porterville Citrus Rayo facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 19,000 LBS. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nPorterville Citrus Rayo has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nPorterville Citrus Rayo's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR ?5189(n)\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Proces"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPorterville Citrus Rayo has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Porterville Citrus Rayo continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Porterville Citrus Rayo's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Porterville Citrus Rayo's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nPorterville Citrus Rayo has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Porterville Citrus Rayo has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Porterville Citrus Rayo now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Porterville Citrus Rayo employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Porterville Citrus Rayo will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
