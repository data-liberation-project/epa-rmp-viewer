Genevieve, Mo. 63670\nContact: \tMike Markway\nPhone: \t573-883-3538\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Ste. Genevieve are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Ste. Genevieve Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of grain, chemicals and liquid fertilizer.  Also, anhydrous ammonia nurse tank wagons are stored on site to be used in the application of anhydrous ammonia as a crop nutrient.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 4,400 pounds in a 1,000-gallon storage tank. There are fifteen, 1,000-gallon nurse tanks which when filled would hold approximately 62,025 pounds.  There are four, 560 gallon applicator tanks that when filled would hold approximately 9,710 pounds.  Therefore, the facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 74,735  pounds. \n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of 3 nurse tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 13,200 pounds, which represents the volume of 3 nurse tanks at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .82 miles.\n\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 1 transfer hose or valve.  This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 2,900 pounds. The distance to the"

The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has;\n\n\ta. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n\t   Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\tb. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n\t   planning and community right-to-know information as\n\t   required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\tc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n\t   OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n\t   planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\t6/16/03"
