Smithfield Packing Company has an on-site trained emergency response team (HAZMAT) and maintains a written emergency response plan which is reveiewed annually. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Fire Department, Police, and Emergency Medical facilities to ensure communication with all potential or actual involved resources should their involvement be necessitated by a release.\r\n\r\nThrough Process Hazard Analysis, inspections, annual reveiws, and audits,  Smithfield Packing Company continuously improves it's process system, procedures, programs, and training to ensure mitigation, control, technology, equipment, and organizational changes remain consistant and in force. Through this initiative, Smithfield Packing Company can ensure the utmost safeguards are utilized as it relates to it's process system and programs for the overall safety and well being of the employees, facility, and the environment.\r\n\r\nAs of April 28, 2014 Smithfield Packing Co.

These Regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In complying this way, we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety.  Smithfield Packing Company's program enables our facility to prevent the occurrance of, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage. \r\n\r\n Smithfield Packing Company safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.     \r\n\r\n Smithfield Packing Company safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and best practices which govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary. All information is communicated to employees of  Smithfield Packing Company through training and documentation. \r\n\r\n Smithfield Packing Company is a pork processing and packaging company, specializing in bacon production, that utilizes approximately 49,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility's production and shipping area's."

The release would travel up to 1.4. miles before no longer posing a significant hazard to the public. However, this scenario is highly unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n...Worst case weather conditions are uncommon\r\n...The vessel is in a protected area clear of vehicular and pedestrian traffic\r\n...Industry standards for the construction and quality control of pressure vessels\r\n...Safety relief valves preventing over-pressurization of the vessel are in use\r\n...Accident prevention programs in place\r\n\u00bfMechanical integrity program, inspection and testing procedures are in place\r\n...Emergency alerting alarms intergrated into the process system\r\n...Emergency response and action plans in place at the facility\r\n\r\nIn an alternative case scenario, a 3/4 diameter hole at the receiver flange could release approximately 9000 pounds  of ammonia over a ten minute  period before no longer posing a significant threat or hazard. The vapor could travel as far as .20 miles. This scenario was chosen as an alternative release because of the higher likelihood that it could occur. This scenario even though potentially possible, is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n...Emergency shut-down procedures in place\r\n...Regular maintenance  upgrades, as assisted by a computer-based PSM/RMP software program\r\n...Inspection and rounds made daily of the process system to ensure safe operation\r\n...Emergency response plan and refrigeration personnel on-site around the clock\r\n\r\n Smithfield Packing Company's accidental release prevention programs are based on safe work practices as referenced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, American National Safety Standards, and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration 2 - 1992.
