The primary function that the company serves is the processing, freezing, and packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Raw product from the growers is received, usually in truck load quantities, delivered to the facility to be processed.  The product is off loaded from the truck and placed in the cooler waiting to be processed.  The product is then graded and cut to customer specifications.  After the product is cut, it is blanched, then run through a IQF Freezer (Individually Quick Frozen), and packaged into various  containers as per customer order.  The already frozen product is then taken by forklift to a cold storage warehouse owned by Hanson Cold Storage Co. that is connected to our facility.\n\n\n\nThe temperatures in storage and freezing areas are properly maintained by the use of a permanently installed closed ammonia refrigeration system.  The primary function of the ammonia refrigeration system is to remove heat from the product and the storage area.  This system consists of compressors, evaporators, vessels, ammonia pumps and condensers necessary for the completion of removing the heat and rejecting it to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nBasic Refrigeration Process Overview:\n\n\n\nLiquid ammonia is supplied to the evaporator located in the coolers and freezers, by either pumps or high pressure (150 psi to 180 psi).  The pressure of the liquid ammonia is reduced as it enters the evaporator.  Heat is supplied to the evaporator coil surface by electric motor driven fans.  The air circulated across the outside of the coils is warmer than the refrigerant inside the coils, thus causing evaporation of the liquid into a vapor.  This vapor is then drawn into the compressor suction, whic"

      "SummaryText": "h compresses the vapor into a higher-pressure superheated gas.  The compressor discharge, which contains the higher-pressure gas, is then pipped to the evaporator condensers.  The corresponding temperature of the higher-pressure gas is then cooled by the ambient air and water sprayed on the outside of the condenser coils.  This cooling process of the higher-pressure gas causes the gas to condense into liquid, which is then supplied to the room area evaporators to continuously repeat the cycle.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration is controlled and operated automatically by the means of a Process Logic Controller, PLC.  The PLC cycles the equipment on and off to maintain the proper area temperatures.  The PLC also serves to monitor many safety cut outs as well as the monitoring of equipment operation in order to address alarm conditions that might occur.\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia refrigerant that is used in the refrigeration system has been classified by OSHA as being a hazardous chemical.   Any facility containing Ammonia in excess of the threshold limitation of 10,000 lbs, set for by OSHA ,is required to develop and implement a Process Safety Management Program.  We currently store approximately 43,000 lbs of ammonia in our system.  We have not had any accidental releases in the past 5 years. We are also registered with the Department of Homeland Security under their CFATS program and have been deemed as not a high risk.\n\n\n\nSAFETY AND HEALTH POLICY\n\n\n\n\"Every employee at Michigan Freeze Pack is entitled to a safe and healthful workplace.  All employees will follow safe and healthful work practices, obey  safety and health rules and regulations, and work in a manner which maintains high safety and health standards. We will provide and maintain, safe and healthful working conditions, and we will establish and insist upon work methods and practices that promote a safe and healthful workplace at all times.

It is the responsibility of the facility manager to, directly or indirectly, instruct all personnel in their specific responsibilities as defined by this plan.  It is the responsibility of all personnel to know their responsibilities and to react to all alarms and signals during and emergency in a swift, yet safe, manner.  Emergency contacts and telephone numbers are included in the Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\n\n\n\nPurpose:\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Emergency Planning is to ensure that all employees, visitors, and contractors of Michigan Freeze Pack are instructed and kept informed of an emergency procedures in the event of an emergency, such as an ammonia leak, tornado, fire, power outage, or bomb threat.\n\n\n\nScope:\n\n\n\nThis plan covers all individuals that work for or are contracted to work for Michigan Freeze Pack.\n\n\n\nProcedures:\n\n\n\n1.  An Emergency Action Plan must be written specifically for each individual facility.\n\n     \n\n     A.  The plan must meet the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120(q).\n\n     B.  The plan must be reviewed and updated at least annually or when a major change is required.\n\n     C.  The plan must be signed be the facility Manager.\n\n\n\n2.  The Emergency Action Plan for each facility must show the following minimum information.\n\n\n\n     A.  Escape routes and procedures for all work areas\n\n     B.  Procedures and those responsible for orderly shutdown of equipment or operations. \n\n     C.
