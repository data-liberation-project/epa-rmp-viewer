This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. We also work closely with our public emergency responders. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Godley Gas Plant, located North of Godley, TX operates a process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from oil and gas wells. The Godley Gas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. It processes approximately 750 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Godley Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Results:\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in a process at the gas plant is a vapor cloud (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest process vessel containing 285,612 pounds of a butane, pentane mix. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.53 miles. No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Godley Gas\n\nPlant.

Process relief valves that discharge to a flare/vent system to handle episodic releases\n\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameter (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation:\n\n\n\n1. Fire extinguishers\n\n2. Personal protective equipment\n\n3. Spacing of equipment in accordance to spacing guideline.\n\n4. Emergency shutdowns strategically placed around the plant that automatically shuts in the inlet and outlet.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures. In addition the Godley Gas Plant has procedures that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated as necessary. Any significant changes to the emergency response program are administered through the management of change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall"

      "SummaryText": " emergency response program for the Godley Gas Plant is coordinated with the Godley Fire Department. The gas plant has around-the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nAlthough Godley Gas Plant management does not believe additional safety measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accident releases, it does resolve all findings from the Process Hazards Analysis and the Compliance Audits. Some of these findings may result in modifications to the process.\n\n\n\n"
