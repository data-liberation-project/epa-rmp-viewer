      "SummaryText": "Superior Pipeline Co. operates a natural gas liquids recovery facility, the Perkins Gas Processing Plant, in Perkins, Oklahoma. The plant is designed to recover liquid products from natural gas via physical separation, dehydration, refrigeration, and expansion. Petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas.  Section 112(r ) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Perkins plant because it handles and stores process flammables such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane and isopentane in excess of threshold quantities. Superior Pipeline Co. management is aware of potential hazards posed by processing and storing natural gas and natural gas liquids. Programs are established to prevent accidental releases and train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nSuperior Pipeline Co. has considered the impact of a \"worst case\" accident.  In this case, the ?worst case? would be a complete release from the 30,000 gallon NGL storage tank, resulting in the instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which ignites and explodes. Using the EPA?s RMP*Comp software version 1.07, the potential radius of impact, due to the explosion, was calculated to extend 0.4 miles. Global positioning system (GPS) was utilized to estimate public receptors within a 1 mile radius.  It was determined that the worst case event would not affect nearby structures, and it was determined that the nearest public receptor was approximately 0.69 miles from the tank.  A consideration of the 0.4 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nSuperior Pipeline Co. implements safety programs and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Operation, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures are implemented.  In addition, Superior Pipeline Co. has coordinated with local emergency responders, including the Perkins Volunteer Fire Department, and the Local Emergency Plannin"
