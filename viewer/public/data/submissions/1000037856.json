Community involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and LEPC.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and\r\nprocess information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process\r\nequipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the What-if technique. This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility sitting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log. \r\n\r\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator. Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments.

The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change. Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which\r\nresulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan - This facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. This plan will be provided to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits and RMP Revisions - To insure that all the other 12 areas of PSM program are followed,\r\nthe company requires compliance audits. At a minimum, these must be completed every three years.\r\nResubmission of the RMP shall be done according to Section 6.2 to meet the OCA requirements.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT HISTORY - LAST FIVE YEARS\r\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents within the past five years.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThere are continuous reviews and updates for all safety programs."

It continuously circulates throughout the system.\r\n\r\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\r\nThis food processing facility operates a multi-temperature, two stage, anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system with an refrigerating capacities at +15\u00b0F, -20\u00b0F, and -40\u00b0F. This refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an over-feed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators.\r\n\r\nMITIGATION MEASURES\r\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The location for the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP. Following is an overview.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole. As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PS"

The stationary source is the Monogram Frozen Foods LLC (formerly Hinsdale Farms) at 605 Kesco Drive, Bristol, IN. The only RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\r\n\r\nThis is a RMP re-submission for an existing ammonia refrigeration system. The refrigeration system in this facility does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard. Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\r\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The program is also in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the RMP & PSM programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan will be provided to the local LEPC for review.\r\n\r\nPROCESS CHEMISTRY\r\nThe process is the standard refrigeration cycle. It uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. The only\r\nsubstance inside the refrigeration system is ammonia. The process causes the ammonia to boil into a gas and then cool into a liquid and then repeats the process. The refrigeration system lowers the liquid pressure to lower the boiling point and then evaporates the ammonia within the system using room air as the heat source. It then compresses the ammonia into a high pressure/temperature and cools the gas until it condenses. The condensed liquid is pumped to a low pressure part of the system where the pressure is lowered and the cycle starts all over. The ammonia changes"

The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their\r\nemployees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors\r\nunderstand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems. This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating\r\nprocedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the\r\nequipment is maintained in good working condition. These are performed on all compressors, ondensers,\r\nevaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown\r\nsystems, controls, and pumps.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).
