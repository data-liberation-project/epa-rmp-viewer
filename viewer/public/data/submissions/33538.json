(GELP) a Non-Utility Generator] is located one mile southwest of Gordonsville near State Route 860 in Louisa County, Virginia.  The facility was purchased by Dominion Virginia Power, November 21, 2003, a regulated electric utility.\n\nThe site is bounded by woodlands, wooded wetlands, and rolling hills. The site is at an elevation of 447 feet above mean sea level.  The Gordonsville facility is a dual fuel-fired, combined-cycle nominal 240-MW power generation facility, located on an 8-acre parcel of land in the northwest corner of Louisa County.  The primary fuel for the combustion turbines is natural gas.   Natural gas is supplied through either of two pipelines, Williams or Columbia Gas Transmission.  The backup fuel is low sulfur No.2 diesel fuel oil.   The ability to combust diesel fuel ensures continuous operation of the plant in the event of a disruption in the supply of natural gas.  \n\nThe owner, Dominion Virginia Power, and the operator LG&E Power Services provide  the highest level of commitment at both the local level (plant operations) and the corporate management level to insure accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are active and effective.  On the operational level, commitment to both Safety and Environmental awareness and compliance can been seen clearly through LG&E Power Service's Core Values:\n1) Safety.\n2) Customer Satisfaction.\n3) Empowerment.\n4) Integrity.\n5) Teamwork.\n6) Continuous Improvement.\n7) Technical Excellence.\n8) Commitment.\n9) Stewardship.\n10) Respect for the Individual.\n11) Citizenship.\n\nA second level of quality assurance is established by the owner's staff, as they schedule representatives to perform Safety and Environmental audits at the site.  This is to insure their asset is complying with the appropriate Federal and State regulations.  \n\nChemical safety t"

Operations personnel conduct inspections on every shift to minimize the consequences of potential leaks or process problems.\n\n\n\nGordonsville Power Station reports the use of only one regulated substance listed by 40 CFR ?68.130, that being aqueous ammonia (concentration 20% or greater), CAS# 7664-41-7.  The solution used at GELP is 29.4%.  This solution is used in the reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) compounds that are produced during the combustion of fossil fuels.\n\nReduction of stack NOx is done through a two step method.  First, minimize the formation of NOx compounds during combustion, then reduce the amount of NOx in the flue gas by catalytic reaction.\n\nThe combustion turbines use a state of the art burner technology called \"Dry Low NOx\", while on natural gas, this burner configuration offers extremely low NOx emissions.  When burning No.2 fuel oil, demineralized water is injected into the combustors to reduce flame temperatures and the formation of NOx.  To reduce the NOx emissions even further, aqueous ammonia is vaporized and injected into the flue gas. By vaporizing the ammonia and injecting it in the flue gas upstream of a catalyst, the ammonia (NH3) functions in the presence of the catalyst to decompose the NOx contained in the flue gas into nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).\n\nPrevious requirements of Risk Management Plan submittals required a brief discussion of the worst case scenario and alternative release scenarios in the executive summary.   Although this is no longer a requirement, it is prudent to mention that no public receptors would be involved in the case of Gordonsville?s alternative release scenario. \n\nGordonsville Power Station employs several practices to provide a thorough accidental release prevention program.  100% containment around the ammonia storage tank and transfer pumps, operator inspection of piping and s"

The operations staff has been trained on chemical safety, first aid, emergency contingency plans, Hazard Communication, Hazardous Waste and Operations and Emergency Response training. \n\n\nGELP has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past ten years.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the training mentioned above, both announced and unannounced annual drills, emergency horns and radio communications at the facility.  We have a qualified contracting agency's on standby that will respond to chemical spills and cleanup operations, and we have confirmed our inclusion with the Local Emergency Planning Committee."
