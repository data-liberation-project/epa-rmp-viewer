THE FACILITIES ARE INSPECTED BY THE KS STATE BOARD OF AG AND COMPANY EMPLOYEES REGULARLY.  ANNUAL TRAINING ABOUT SAFETY, HAZARDS OF OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MAINTENANCE IS HANDLED BY THE COMPANY AND OUTSIDE SPEALISTS.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE RUPTURE OF A 30,000 GALLON TANK RELEASING 141,000 POUNDS OF AMMONIA (ANHYDROUS)  TO AN END POINT OF 2.6 MILES IN 10 MINUTES AFFECTING 85 PEOPLE.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE (HOSE FAILURE)  WOULD RELEASE 12,000 OF NH3 TO AN END POINT OF .83 MILES AFFECTING 40 PEOPLE.  THERE HAS BEEN NO RELEASE AT THIS PLANT FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS.  THE EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN IS STUDIED AND UPDATED ANNUALLY OR SOONER AND IS COORDINATED WITH THE FORD COUNTY LEPC WHO TRAIN AT THIS FACILITY.  HOUSEKEEPING AND INSPECTIONS ARE TOP PRIORITY BY THESE EMPLOYEES."
