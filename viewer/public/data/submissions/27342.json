      "SummaryText": "Chemical Usage:\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at this facility as a refrigerant to chill and preserve our citrus products.  The refrigeration process used is totally enclosed preventing chemical leakage under normal operation.  Fresh fruit arrives at our facility during the normal citrus fruit harvesting season, which occures from October through May.  Fresh fruit is converted into citrus juices for storage in our refrigerated facilities to preserve its fresh quality.  Juice remains chilled in storage, by our refrigeration systems, than packaged into finished product for retail sale.\n  \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nCitrus World, Inc. d.b.a. Florida's Natural Growers maintains a proactive safety policy through employee involvement thus providing a safe environment for our employees and the surrounding local community.  We prevent accidental releases through classroom and on the job training of refrigeration personal and ongoing inspection and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  New additions to the refrigeration system are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., pipes placed on roofs, tanks placed away and protected from forklifts and truck traffic).  Key technical and supervisory personnel are properly trained and equipped to respond to onsite anhydrous ammonia releases, requiring entry into contaminated zones, rescue, risk assessment, spill, and leak control.\n\nSource and Regulated Substances Handled:\nApproximately 250,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site and is dispursed among eight refrigeration equipment rooms.  No other substances, in quantities requiring an EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the facility.  To aid in operational safety of the refrigeration systems we have designed in two separate processes identified as Process 1 and Process 2.  Both processes contain anhydrous ammonia chemical.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario (Process 1 and 2)"

Equipment room 4 is not reportable because it contains less than 10,000 pounds of chemical.  The vertical anhydrous ammonia high pressure receiver, located outside of equipment room 1 was chosen as our worst case chemical release scenario for both reported processes.  The volume of this tank was assumed to be 80% full under an internal pressure of approximately 185 psi and temperature of  95 degrees Fahrenheit.  The Worst Case Scenario for this process as required, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a gas/vapor over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe computer air dispersion model, \"Screen3\", predicted, with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and atmospheric stability class F,  concentration above 200 ppm of anhydrous ammonia could reach some areas of the surrounding community. \n\nAlternate Case Scenario Process 1\nThe Alternate Case Release Scenario was selected to involve a drain line, at the condenser unit supply line, located on the east side of \"C\" building, severed by a truck/forklift during loading operations.  The 3/4 inch (inner diameter) drain line pipe extends downwards approximately 2 feet from a two inch supply pipe which extends approximately 50 feet from Engine Room #3 to the condenser.  Anhydrous ammonia (at 150 psi and 95 degrees Fahrenheit) was estimated to have a flow rate of approximately 90lbs/min from two-phase (gas/liquid) choked flow equations.  It is estimated that the supply line could be isolated in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators, with a corresponding total anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 900 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.  The air disperision model predicted, with a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, that only minor amounts of anhydrous ammonia would travel off site and have only a small affect on the surrounding community.  \n\nAlternate Case Scenario Process 2\nDue to the simularity of process"

Necessary repairs to the refrigeration system are made in a prompt, safe manner.\n\n5 Year Accidental History:\nWe have experienced a total of five incidents of employee injury due to incidental exposure to ammonia.  Four incidents had resulted in minor medical treatment, with only one incident requiring admission to a hospital.

The chemcial did not travel off site and it was contained within the building and the leak was stopped quickly.  The routine maintenance procedure was changed and all operators have been trained on the procedure.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nDuring normal weekday operation, the facility emergency response plan consists of employee notification  and evacuation, followed by immediate notification of the appropriate community reponse agencies.  Maintenance and technical personnel have received hazardous material technician level training in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(iii).  Supervisory personnel have received incident commander level training in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(v).  A facility emergency evacuation plan have been prepared and disseminated to facility personnel.  Evacuation routes in case of an anhyrdous ammonia release, are noted in the plan.\n\nRed Cross shelter resouces in the Lake Wales area consist of pre-arranged service agreements with the local school board and some local churches.  Schools that would serve as a Red Cross shelter would provide space and cafeteria food to shelter inhabitants.  Schools would be reimbursed for food/supplies by the Red Cross,  In addition the local Red Cross office is capable of supplying shelter kits consisting of basic first-aid supplies and blankets.  Activation of a Lake Wales area Red Cross shelter would be initiated by calling \"911.\"  A local fire Department commander would decide if evacuation and shelter were required in a given emergency, who would then notify the county emergency management agency, who would in turn direct the Red Cross to activate the designated shelter.
