The site follows the corporate crisis management plan 5.1.2 and its own Emergency response plan. Our facility produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from Chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic). \n\nRegulated Substances Handled \nThe RMP has been prepared to address the handling of chlorine at the Augusta plant. Liquid chlorine is received in 94 ton railcars and used in the manufacture of bleach. Augusta has a comprehensive release prevention program meeting the Federal RMP prevention program and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. We follow best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation. Our process design includes expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping. The site also maintains a caustic scrubber to prevent accidental releases. \n\nFive-year accident history\nThe Augusta site has had not had any releases in its 5 year history meeting that definition. All releases are tracked through AMT, which is the sites online incident tracking tool. Investigations are managed online and any resulting corrective or preventive actions are tracked to closure using AMT.\nEmergency Response Program \nAugusta has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes the installation of detection, alarm, shutdown, containment and scrubbing systems to halt and/or mitigate a release. Augusta has an emergency response team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a written Emergency Response plan. Augusta coordinates drills with the Augusta-Richmond County Emergency Operations and completes drills regularly.\n\n Planned Changes to Improve Safety: The site has added liquid level switches in its vacuum chlorine line an"
