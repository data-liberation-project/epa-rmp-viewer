The main header goes directly into the pressure regulator/switchover room where the system goes from pressure to vacuum.  This room has a chlorine gas detection system to warn of a chlorine gas leak as well as a ventilation system to draw fresh air in and force air out near the floor.\n     The chlorine is then drawn by vacuum into the chlorinator room.  Fresh air is forced into the room, with exhaust air going out from the floor level.  Three separate chlorinators and a series of valves control the application point and amount of chlorine applied.  Chlorine continues to be drawn throught the system to the point of application.  The vacuum is created by an open impeller inductor system that draws the chlorine directly into the water stream.  The inductor system also mixes the chlorine with the water stream just prior to entering the chlorine contact chamber where a minimum 20-minute detention time is maintained for disinfection.  The system will alarm in the event of a hogh vacuum or inductor failure.",

      "SummaryText": "     Executive Summary\n     Brazos River Authority\n     Temple-Belton Regional Sewerage System\n\nThe Temple-Belton Regional Sewerage System is an innovative and cost-effective regional sewerage system that serves the wastewater treatment needs of the urban areas in and around the cities of Temple and Belton, Texas. The plant was opened in 1975 and expanded in 1989. It has a system capacity of 10.0 million gallons per day permitted average flow; and 30.0 million gallons per day permitted peak flow- It currently treats an average daily flow of 5.2 million gallons per day. Plant awards include: two Environmental Excellence awards in 1994 from EPA Region VI; the Operations and Maintenance Excellence Award in 1992 from EPA Region VI; the Operations and Maintenance Excellence Award in 1992 from the Texas Water Commission; and 1st place in the 1992 Operations Challenge and 2nd place in the 1991 Operations Challenge from the TWPCA/TWUA.\n\nOnly chlorine and sulfur dioxide, used to disinfect the water, are stored above the allowable threshold quantity.\n\n     Chlorine\n\nChlorine serves to destroy disease-causing organisms and for prevention of algae growth in the Treatment Plant effluent. It is essential that all plant effluent have a chlorine residual of at least 1.0 mg/L after 20 minutes contact. The recommended dose for application to effluent from the activated sludge process is eight mg/L.\n\nThe chlorine is stored in 11 one-ton cylinders, and is used in groups of two and one. One group is in use and the other is held as backup. The second group is engaged by an automatic switchover module when the first group is exhausted. Each group is connected to a header that is provided with a separate vacuum regulator, which reduces the gas from a varying supply pressure to a constantly regulated vacuum. Chlorine gas feeder cabinets are wallmounted in the Chlorination Room. One feeder is equipped with an automatic rate control valve. The other feeders are equipped with a manual rate con"

Sufficient valving has been provided to allow different feeders to serve different junction boxes.\n\nInduction units provide the vacuum required to pull the chlorine gas to the various points of application. These induction units create a vacuum through a motordriven open propeller, located 24 inches below the minimum water surface, which also provides mixing of the chlorine gas with the wastewater and feeds directly into the Chlorine Contact Chambers. Chlorine feed rates are adjusted by the automatic rotameters in response to changes in the flow rate and residual. There are three chlorine contact chambers at the Temple-Belton Plant: Chlorine Contact Chambers No. 1 and No. 2 will each detain a flow of seven million gallons per day (mgd) for 20 minutes- Chlorine Contact Chamber No. 3 will detain a flow of 23 mgd for 20 minutes.\n\n     Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe  concentration  of  the  chlorine  residual measured  at  the effluent  weirs  of  the  Chlorine Contact  Chambers  is  used  to determine  the  amount of sulfur dioxide dosed  at  the  Effluent Structure. The plant effluent flow is to be dechlorinated to less than 0.1 mg/L for discharge.\n\nSulfur dioxide is stored in a maximum of five one-ton cylinders (usually three are on site at any given time), also connected to separate headers that are mounted on anchored supports. Almost all of  the  equipment used for sulfur dioxide feeding and  induction, with  the exception  of  the rotameters  and  some  materials of construction, is identical to the equipment used for chlorine induction.\n\nSulfur dioxide gas feeders, or manual rotameters, are wall-mounted. One rotameter is equipped with an automatic rate control valve- The other rotameters are equipped with a manual ratecontrol valve. Two of these rotameters have been supplied, each capable of delivering the maximum recommended dose of sulfur dioxide. Sufficient valving has been provided so that either inducti"

      "SummaryText": "on unit for this system may be fed through either rotameter.\n\nSulfonation (the process of sulfur dioxide reduction of the chlorine residual) takes place almost instantly. For this reason, it is not necessary to provide a contact chamber for detention of the flow. Sulfur dioxide is introduced into the flow at the Effluent Structure.\n\n     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAuthority policy requires a written emergency action plan,  annual exercises and reviews of the plan, emergency response training for facility  personnel, and coordination with local  responders.  In addition, monthly safety inspections  are  conducted  by the Authority's  Safety Officer.\n\n     Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the release of 2,000 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide (one-ton cylinder) in 10 minutes. The release rate is 200 Ibs./min. The EPA rules specify an atmospheric stability of F and a wind speed of 1 .5 meters per second. The maximum temperature in the last three years was 104 degrees F.   No passive mitigation measures are in place. Therefore, the distance to the end point for sulfur dioxide vapor is 3.1 miles in a Rural environment. \n\n     Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe plant did not have any reportable accidental releases of regulated chemicals in the past five years so we chose to analyze a broken 5/16\" valve/pipe connection at the vessel interface for both Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide. A vapor release was chosen because the plant does not use liquid chlorine or sulfur dioxide. EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables specify an atmospheric stability of D and a wind speed of 3 meters per second. According to Exhibit 4-15 (Chlorine Vapor), the release rate is 15 lbs./min. No passive or active mitigation measures are in place. Therefore, the distance to the end point for chlorine vapor is 0.2 miles in a Rural environment. The very same conditions apply to Sulfur Dioxide. According to Exhibit 4-19 (Sulfur Di"

Personnel are also trained to shut down the system by closing the cylinder valve in the event of an emergency or anticipated emergency.\n\n     Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe  plant  has  not  had  any accidental  releases of  regulated chemicals in the last five years.\n\n     Emergency Response Program\n\nTBRSS has the capability to respond to and mitigate the release of on-site hazardous chemicals that present a moderate health and/or safety threat to TBRSS and responding personnel, present a moderate potential for adverse environmental impact, are of limited size, and have low fire/explosion potential. If the spill/release is beyond the capability of onsite personnel, the City of Belton and Bell Counts HAZMAT teams will respond by calling 911. Training and exercises are conducted periodically, especially since 9-11. The  city and county have been conducting regional WMD-terrorist exercises, which included response to hazardouis chemical releasess. \n\n     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWe are conducting joint training with local first responders and conducting additional internal HAZMAT and chemical safety training for operators, maintenance, and administrative personnel. Security enhancements and procedures have been made since 9-11 and continuous improvements are made as resources become available."
