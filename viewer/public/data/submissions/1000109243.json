The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs. Company safety programs include but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which is an integrated approach to Accidental Release Prevention & the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances. The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen. It is the goal of the company to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.\n\nThe Company recognizes the need to be prepared to safely deal with emergencies. A Hazardous Material Business Plan consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements has been developed and includes emergency procedures, requirements, and information necessary to notify public response agencies and technical resources; the Staff communicate to the Fire Department and evacuate (or shelter-in-place) if there is a release situation or fire. Managers and employees would also shepherd visitors (truck drivers receiving product or delivering product).

The berries are on site generally from 1-4 days from harvesting depending on market demand. The facility is seasonally operated with product harvest periods picking up in the month of November and finishing in July. The remaining months see little fresh product. However, the refrigeration equipment is still operative. Major maintenance is performed in the off-season. Operational maintenance is performed on a year-round basis.
