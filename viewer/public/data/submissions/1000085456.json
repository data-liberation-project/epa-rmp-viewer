Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  This facility maintains approximately 28 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and 32 1,500 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 355,600 pounds.
