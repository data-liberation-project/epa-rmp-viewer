The worst case release scenario assumes that all the content in the largest vessel (i.e. 34,000-gallon railcar) is released.   The release scenario consists of the railcar being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.  The worst case aqua ammonia release scenario assumes that the largest vessel (i.e. a 32,000-gallon AST) fails and instantaneously releases all contents on to the ground.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes that an operator fails to fully close the vapor valve on the railcar.  The alternative scenario for Covered Processes 2, 3 and 4 assumes that a 3-inch liquid transfer hose is severed during a transfer process.  The alternative scenario for Covered Processes 2, 3 and 4 considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. remote actuated emergency shutoff valves), and operating procedures that the Facility and Contractor implement to safeguard against ammonia releases from transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Magic Valley Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Magic Valley Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Magic Valley Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Accident Prevention Program elements.

The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update in accordance with the rule.  All accident prevention elements have been reviewed and/or updated.\r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural and commercial chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  The covered processes operated at this Facility include:\r\n\r\no\tCovered Process 1: Railcar Storage (Anhydrous Ammonia)\r\no\tCovered Process 2: APP Blending (Ammonium Polyphosphate)\r\no\tCovered Process 3: Anhydrous Ammonia S&H and Aqua Blending\r\no\tCovered Process 4: Aqua Ammonia S&H\r\n\r\nThe Facility coordinates delivery of anhydrous ammonia by railcar.  The anhydrous ammonia is used to blend APP Fertilizer and Aqua Ammonia.  The APP Fertilizer is blended by a Contactor (A.K.A. Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor - IFRC) using a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR).  The Aqua Ammonia is blended in a stationary aqua converter that is owned and operated by the Facility.  The Aqua Ammonia is stored and then transferred to a Cargo Truck for delivery to the customer.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for each covered process.  The worst case anhydrous ammonia release scenario is the same for Covered Processes 1, 2 and 3 because the largest vessel (i.e. a 34,000-ga"
