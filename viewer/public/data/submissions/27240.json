The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.\n\nAmmonia\nBryan\u00bfs worst-case release scenario for ammonia is the rupture of the 25# recirculator (74,124 pounds when filled to maximum allowable) over a 10-minute period.  Using the USEPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance (40 CFR Part 68) for Ammonia Refrigeration, May 2000 (\u00bfRefrigeration Guidance\u00bf), the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.9 miles.\n\nDuring normal operations, Bryan maintains the 25# recirculator at no more than 20% capacity.  Only during emergency or failure does the recirculator have the potential to be filled to 50% of capacity.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nAmmonia\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Bryan taking into consideration operational history and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).  A likely release scenario identified by Bryan would be a release from a leaking pump seal associated with one of the 25# recirculator pumps.  The scenario assumes a release from a 1/8 inch opening in the pump seal.  In developing the release parameters of this alternative scenario, Bryan considered other possible scenarios and"

Using the Refrigeration Guidance document\u00bfs procedures for estimating release values, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.10 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program: \n\nAmmonia\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Bryan has implemented several precautionary measures.  Bryan has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs and electrical distribution system grounding).\n\nBryan has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by system operators and are reviewed at a frequency sufficient to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in the technology, the equipment and the facility.  Bryan encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Bryan, any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees.\n\nBryan understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Bryan has implemented preventative maintenance programs.  Each preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using log sheets to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  These log sheets are maintained in the Engineering Department for three years.  Also, to ensure the mechanic"

(Bryan) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their West Point, Mississippi, facility.  Bryan\u00bfs operations include the manufacturing of pork and beef food products for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand name \u00bfBryan\u00bf.  Bryan has been in operation at this facility for over 66 years providing quality meat products and approximately 1,915 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\n\nBryan is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is Bryan\u00bfs policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119) and OSHA\u00bfs Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances:\n\nBryan is subject to 112(r) because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.\n  \nBryan is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  Bryan uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants.  Bryan\u00bfs refrigeration system consists of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, piping, pumps, valves and recirculators.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide, both regulated substances, are kept onsite, but below t"
