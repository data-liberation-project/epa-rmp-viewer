      "SummaryText": "1.0    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nContinental Nitrogen & Resources Corporation (CNR) is a storage terminal for large quantities of anhydrous ammonia.  The quantity of stored product ranges from 3,000 to 20,000 tons depending on the time of year.  Ammonia is listed under SARA Title III as an ?Extremely Hazardous Substance?.  Because of this classification and the quantity of product stored on site, a program is required to be in place to ensure (1) that the process is managed appropriately, (2) safety measures are in place to protect employees, the surrounding community, and the environment, and (3) to aid in the development of a community response in the event of an emergency situation.\n\nCNR?s ammonia operations are covered under two separate regulations, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (U.S. OSHA).  The U.S. EPA requires that a Risk Management Program (RMP) be established and implemented under 40 CFR Part 68.  U.S. OSHA requires that a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan be established and implemented under 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  This plan has been designed to comply with both sets of regulations and is hereafter referred to as a RMP.\n\nCNR operates the Facility in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of employees, contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  In addition, CNR is committed to operating the Facility in full compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  CNR has designed and implemented a number of plans to ensure that the Facility is operating safely and to provide detailed procedures for a response to incidents that may occur on-site.  The Plant Superintendent has the primary responsibilities for these plans, directing response activities, this RMP, and it?s implementation.\n\n1.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCNR is located at 12955 Courthouse Bo"

CNR has multiple storage vessels and loading and unloading areas located within the boundaries of the site.  Associated piping and appurtances are also present.\n\nCNR storage vessels have a maximum storage capacity of 23,800 tons of anhydrous ammonia, chemical abstract service (CAS) number 7664-41-7.  CNR also has an aqueous ammonia manufacturing facility on site.  Anhydrous ammonia is transferred through piping from the anhydrous ammonia storage spheres to the Aqua Ammonia Plant.  There, the anhydrous ammonia is blended with softened water to create aqueous ammonia with concentrations ranging from 19 percent to 29 percent.  This process is also covered by this RMP.\n\nA Facility Diagram is included as Figure 1.\n\n1.3    Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted in 1994 to identify and determine the hazards associated with both processes.  Subsequent updates have been conducted since that time.  CNR gathered a team to complete the latest update of the PHA on June 10, 2004.  The update was completed and included team members from Management, the Maintenance Department, and Process Operators.  The team members were selected based on personal experience, expertise, and knowledge of the operation of the systems and subsystems present at the Facility.  The PHA team utilized a modified ?What-If? method of identifying the hazards in each of the subcategories of the operations at the Facility.  The results of the PHA were used to identify potential deficiencies in the processes and to identify recommendations to correct the deficiencies.\n\nCNR has developed detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the various operations located throughout the Facility.  The SOPs have been written to provide clear instructions for safely conducting operations and the handling of ammo"

Each employee is trained on the SOPs for the areas and job functions that that individual will work in/perform prior to beginning work.  \n\nThe SOPs are reviewed and updated, as necessary, whenever there has been a major change in the process and prior to startup of the changed process.  The SOP manuals found throughout the Facility are then updated in a timely manner.  When there are changes to an SOP, all applicable employees are trained on the change in the procedure.\n\nCNR has also developed and implemented a comprehensive Preventive Maintenance (PM) Program to assure CNR maintains a proactive stance on maintenance of the system, minimizes shutdowns and breakdowns within the system, and ensures that the safety of the process remains intact and in good operational condition.  \n\n1.4    Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents during the previous five years that resulted in the on-site or off-site consequences as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.42(a).\n\n1.5    Emergency Response Program\n\nCNR has developed and implemented an Emergency Response Program, known as the Emergency Control Plan, which identifies and defines CNR?s coordinated response to accidental releases from the Facility?s covered processes.  Procedures are identified for the identification of a release and enacting the Emergency Control Plan.  CNR has coordinated this Plan with outside agencies and responders that enter the site in the event of emergency situations.\n\nCNR provides initial and refresher training for all affected employees prior to beginning work at the Facility and inclusion as a responder.  The Emergency Control Plan utilizes an incident command system to respond to an accident.  The Disaster Officer and Communications Officer will coordinate with outside agencies in responding to on-site and off-site consequences, including evacuations, as the response warrants.\n\n1.6    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis RMP includes a number of changes and enhancements to be"
