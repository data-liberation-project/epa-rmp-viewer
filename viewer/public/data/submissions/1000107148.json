In the case of hydrogen, the volume is less than 100 pounds. The threshold for flammables is 10,000 pounds or greater. This product is shipped by pipeline to near industrial neighbors to be used as fuel or processed to a liquid form. Hydrochloric Acid solution is regulated by RMP at 37% concentration or greater. The guidelines at McIntosh are that we do not receive or manufacture acid that exceeds that concentration.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use, manufacturing, or handling of Chlorine.  There have been two RMP releases in the past five years.\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following prevention steps:\n* Site wide chlorine monitors \n* Automatic shut off valves for loading operations\n* Well trained work force\n* Preventative and predictive maintenance systems through mechanical integrity\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the McIntosh facility.
