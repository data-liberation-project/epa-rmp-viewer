The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.  Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for Cameron Meadows Plant is coordinated with the Cameron Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP). This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  Cameron Meadows Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the Cameron Parish OEP. The plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the OEP and emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve"
