Introduction\n\nThe Natchez Wastewater Treatment plant treats wastewater generated by the inhabitants and businesses located in the city of Natchez, MS.  The city of Natchez has a population of 19,460 people and a number of businesses, schools, industrial facilities, and recreational areas.\n\nII.  Regulated Substance and Covered Process\n\nIn order to comply with Federal and State regulations concerning water treatment, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used for the disinfection of wastewater.  There is up to 4,000 lbs. of chlorine and 4,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide in process at any given time, therefore, the Natchez Wastewater Treatment Plant falls into Level II of the EPA's Risk Management Program Regulations.\n\nIII.  Emergency Response and Policies\n\nThe Natchez Wastewater Treatment Plant is committed to reliably treating wastewater that conforms to all local, state, and federal water quality standards for the inhabitants of Natchez, MS with public safety as a top priority.  The Natchez Water Works has coordinated emergency response activities with the local fire department, police department, and civil defense organization among others.\n\n IV.  Accidental Prevention Program\n\nThe facility's accident prevention program includes each of the elements required by the Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nV.  Safety Information\n\nThe Natchez Wastewater Treatment Plant has gathered the necessary documentation of safety information on the covered chlorine and sulfur dioxide process including a chlorine and sulfur dioxide material safety data sheet, maximum intended inventory of equipment in which chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored or processed, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flow rates in all of the equipment in which chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored or processed, equipment specifications, and applicable codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the proces"
