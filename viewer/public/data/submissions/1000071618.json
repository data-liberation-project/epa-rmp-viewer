The plant, located in the Rangely Weber Sand Unit field, is approximately three miles west of the naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas in Rio Blanco County.  \n\n\n\nThe primary activities of the  Plant involving RMP regulated substances are recovering a casing head natural gas product by chilling a gas stream.  A distillation process is used to purify the product that condenses as a result of chilling the stream.  The refrigeration system re-circulates a refrigerant to remove heat from the stream being processed.  The extraction process and the refrigeration process is a Program Level 1. This facility has regulated flammables, including propane, butane, and pentane. H2S is also present in the inlet gas but at concentrations below 1%. The boundaries of the stationary source are defined by the external fence surrounding the facility.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Rangely Weber Sand Unit (RWSU) NGL Plant.  Processes at the RWSU NGL Plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPAs) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety "

This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that addresses each accident prevention program element.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Operating Procedures. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains files that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes: material of construction, design and construction of process equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equip"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate. \n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant uses different Hazard Analysis techniques, including HazOpS/LOPA, which are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazard of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when risk levels are above acceptable levels.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are shared with the affected personnel. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) Initial startup, (2) normal startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, when applicable (5) consequences of deviation (6) normal shutdown, and (7) emergency shutdown.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes. In addition, the RWSU NGL Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the RWSU NGL Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. While completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own through a competency assessment, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator via documentation kept either at the facility or in LMS/CMS (Learning Management System/Competency Management System).\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by making sure contractors are provided with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the RWSU NGL Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to make sure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and compressors in a safe operating condition.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the RWSU NGL Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemente"

      "SummaryText": "d. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThe processes at the RWSU NGL Plant have hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities:\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RWSU NGL Plant.\n\nCollectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could\n\nbe caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features:\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release,\n\n(2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following\n\ntypes of safety features are used in the covered processes\n\n\n\nRelease Detection:\n\n\n\n1.Hydrocarbon and hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms.\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control:\n\n\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to flare\n\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure; high level, etc.)\n\n4. Curbing, diking or secondary containment to contain liquid releases\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred at RWSU NGL Plant in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the enviro"

      "SummaryText": "nment. The Emergency Action Plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties. The Emergency Action Plan is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to processes or other RWSU NGL Plant facilities.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the RWSU NGL Plant has been coordinated with the Rio Blanco LEPC. The RWSU NGL Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations. This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. The RWSU NGL Plant conducts periodic emergency drills and provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the RWSU NGL Plant.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant resolves recommendations and findings from PHA studies, safety audits, and incident investigation to improve safety and operations to the plant process. Some recommendations or findings result in modifications to the process.\n\n"
