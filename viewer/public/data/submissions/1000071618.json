The plant, located in the Rangely Weber Sand Unit field, is approximately three miles west of the naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas in Rio Blanco County.  \n\nThe primary activities of the  Plant involving RMP regulated substances are recovering a casing head natural gas product by chilling a gas stream.  A distillation process is used to purify the product that condenses as a result of chilling the stream.  The refrigeration system re-circulates a refrigerant to remove heat from the stream being processed.  The extraction process and the refrigeration process is a Program Level 1. This facility has regulated flammables, including propane, butane, and pentane. H2S is also present in the inlet gas but at concentrations below 1%. The boundaries of the stationary source are defined by the external fence surrounding the facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Rangely Weber Sand Unit (RWSU) NGL Plant.  Processes at the RWSU NGL Plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPAs) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Hea"

This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that addresses each accident prevention program element.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Operating Procedures. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe facility also maintains files that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes: material of construction, design and construction of process equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating hist"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate. \n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant uses different Hazard Analysis techniques, including HazOpS/LOPA, which are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazard of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when risk levels are above acceptable levels.\n\nThe PHA team findings are shared with the affected personnel. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) Initial startup, (2) normal startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, when applicable (5) consequences of deviation (6) normal shutdown, and (7) emergency shutdown.

In addition, the RWSU NGL Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the RWSU NGL Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. While completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own through a competency assessment, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator via documentation kept either at the facility or in LMS/CMS (Learning Management System/Competency Management System).\n\nContractors\n\nThe RWSU NGL Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
