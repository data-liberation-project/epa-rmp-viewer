To minimize property damage.\n\nCity of Burbank maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nCity of Burbank has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department.

The chlorine system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is surrounded by chain link fence with access through one gate only.

Gaseous chlorine stored in one-ton containers in the chlorine storage room is metered and added to potable supply water in the chlorine feed room using two chlorinators and two injectors, respectively.  The resulting chlorine solution is added to the influent groundwater in a diffuser vault prior to the five million gallon reservoir (forebay) for primary disinfection.  The forebay is used to provide the required chlorine contact time for primary disinfection by free chlorination.\n\nIn the chlorine storage room at the Valley Pumping Plant, two one-ton chlorine containers are maintained on-line.  A motorized automatic switchover valve allows only one of the containers to feed chlorine at a time. When the switchover valve detects high vacuum from one of the containers, it opens to supply chlorine from the other container. All empty tanks connected to the manifold are replaced with a full tank from the storage area.  This replacement is done by City of Burbank operators using a monorail hoist.\n\nWhile connected to the system, two ton containers are placed on a scale to allow City of Burbank operators to plan the change out procedure.  Each one ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  The vacuum regulator/heater assembly is placed on the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas is pulled from the container. The vacuum created at the injector(s) produces the necessary vacuum to operate the vacuum regulators on and chlorine distribution system.  The heater is used to ensure that gaseous chlorine does not condense.\n\nThe chlorine gas is pulled from the one ton container to the chlorinators through the vacuum regulator.  The chlorinators are equipped with rotameters to control the flow of the chlorine gas.  After the chlorinator, the chlorine is injected (by the injector) into the water line to create a chlorine solution.\n\nDetectors in the storage and feed rooms indicate chlorine gas leaks.

The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account as the release could occur outside during delivery procedures.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm in urban conditions.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n*  Alternative Release Result Summary\n\n     Scenario Description:  A release of chlorine from resulting from a 5/16 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 14.6 pounds per minute (8.0 pounds per minute to the outside atmosphere taking into account the enclosure of the building).  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.

The disinfection operations at the facility operates 24 hours a day, seven days per week.  The Valley Pumping Plant maintains tight control of its chlorine system through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are three mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine sensors / detectors, 2) alarms, and 3) emergency chlorine scrubber system.  The chlorine sensors that trigger audible and visual alarms at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm are located in the chlorine storage room and the chlorinator room.  Once a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm is detected by the sensors, the chlorine scrubber system is activated which neutralizes gaseous chlorine in the room resulting in a lower chlorine concentration, and an off-site alarm company will alert the local fire department via telephone.  \n\nThe emergency chlorine scrubber is located outside and east of the chlorine storage room.  The system is designed to achieve a flow rate of 3,000 cubic feet per minute and is capable of completely neutralizing more than 400 pounds of chlorine vapor on a once-through basis (equivalent to a complete ton container failure with an average 20% flash off rate).  The scrubber design requirements are based on the Uniform Fire Code (UFC), which allows for a maximum concentration of chlorine in the scrubber exhaust of 10 parts per million (ppm).\n\nFuse plugs serve as safety relief for one-ton containers.
