      "SummaryText": "Sauer Brands, Inc. is a Delaware corporation having a food (mayonnaise, salad dressings, sauces, jellies, & similar items) manufacturing facility in New Century, Kansas. An integral part of the manufacturing process is the use of refrigeration to cool and/or \"crystallize\" the various products and to maintain the finished products at proper storage temperature prior to shipment. At Sauer Brands, Inc. the refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in a non-contact closed loop refrigeration system. Ammonia exists as a gas at atmoshperic pressure, however, ammonia is found in both gaseous and liquid (liquified by pressure) forms within the ammonia refrigeration system, depending upon where it is located in the system. The ammonia refrigeration system is distributed throughout the production and storage areas of the facility.\n\n\n\nSauer Brands, Inc. is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management Regulations (29 CFR Part 1910.119) as well as similar state regulations. The various elements of the Process Safety Management Program at Sauer Brands, Inc. form the core of the accidental release and emergency response efforts at the facility. Corporate policy requires compliance with these regulations in accordance with the facility's written PSM/RMP programs.\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no reportable accidents since startup in 2001.\n\n\n\nSauer Brands, Inc. is committed to process safety and understands that the former owner endeavored to design and construct a facility which can be properly maintained and operated safely throughout its life. The facility, including the ammonia refrigeration system, was designed and built by carefully selected professional engineers and qualified and experienced contractors in accordance with applicable modern Codes and Standards. The ammonia refrigeration system continues to be maintained & operated by trained, experienced, and qualified staff."
