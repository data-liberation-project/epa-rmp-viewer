      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis report contains the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the ammonia refrigeration system located at the Unilever Ice Cream facility in Clearwater, FL.  This revised RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  This revision is being prepared as part of our five - year update.   This revision was prepared by Perry J. Harlan, the TPM maintenance supervisor and PSM / Environmental coordinator for the facility.  Mr. Harlan received training in preparation of RMP submissions by Mr. Peter Jordan of MBD Risk Management in 2009.  Mr. Harlan was also the submitter of the 2009 resubmission and a correction in 2011.\n\n\n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nUnilever recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the surrounding community, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a key responsibility of all personnel in the Clearwater facility.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal of ZERO losses, the facility has in place a Safety, Health and Environmental Policy, Mission Statement and Principles.  These are supported by the entire management staff and personnel. A Plant safety team and incident investigation team have been formed to ensure compliance with the Unilever SHE Policy, Mission and Principles.\n\n\n\nThe Unilever SHE Principles are:\n\n\n\n1. All Incidents are Preventable\n\n2. Employee Involvement is Essential\n\n3. Employees are Trained to work Safely\n\n4. Working Safely is a \"Condition of Employment\n\n5. SHE Audits are Performed\n\n6. Safety Contacts & Observations are Performed\n\n7. SHE Deficiencies are Corrected Promptly\n\n8. \"Off-the-Job\" safety is Promoted\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the "

      "SummaryText": "Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The TPM Maintenance Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  \n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nUnilever operates an ice cream production facility in Clearwater, FL.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the facility currently complies with the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system has been made subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\nA? Employee Participa"

The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n\n\nA? Process Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nA? Process Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies using the What-If Technique have been conducted to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\n\n\n\nA? Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nA? Training:  A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nA? Contractors:  All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n\n\nA? Pre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre startup safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.\n\n\n\nA? Mechanical Integrity:  This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.  A CMMS system is in place to schedule and track all maintenance and inspection activities.\n\n\n\nA? Hot Work Permit:  These procedures ensure that a signed permit is o"

Management of Change:  The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.  \n\n\n\nA? Incident Investigation:  The procedures ensure that any incidents (and near misses) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\n\n\n\nA? Compliance Audits:  There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the RM program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.\n\n\n\nD. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo accidents meeting the definitions contained in 40 CFR 68 were reported in the past 5 year period.\n\n\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Clearwater facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Pinellas Park Fire Department and The District 8 LEPC.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\nA? Organization Plan and Responsibilities\n\nA. Emergency systems and equipment \n\nA? Communications Procedures \n\nA? Detailed Action Plans\n\nA? First Aid Procedures \n\nA?

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSeveral recommendations to improve safety were made when a process hazard analysis (PHA) study was carried out in February 2014 for the ammonia refrigeration system at the Clearwater facility.  The recommended changes are being evaluated by management and are being addressed and resolved in a timely manner."
