      "SummaryText": "Front Range Energy, LLC. will operate as an ethanol fuel production plant located Windsor, in Weld County, Colorado.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Front Range Energy, LLC. completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 20,000 pounds for aqueous ammonia and 10,000 pounds for ethane, propane, butane, and pentane.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nFront Range Energy, LLC. is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically ethane, propane, butane, and pentane, as potential constituents of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant (flammable) as well as aqueous ammonia (toxic).  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  It is the policy of Front Range Energy, LLC. to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Front Range Energy, LLC. to notify the Windsor Severence Fire Department, Union Colony Fire Rescue Authority, and Weld County Sheriff Department and conduct an applicable plant evacuation all employees per their Incident Command System.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process co-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately up to 5 percent ethane, 5 percent propane, 25 percent butane, and 30 percent pentane, RMP regulated substances.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimate"

      "SummaryText": "d to be 834,000 pounds (total ethane - 41,700, total propane A? 41,700, total butane A? 208,500, and total pentane A? 250,200 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which comprises a secondary containment dike.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and is not anticipated to contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  Aqueous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum aqueous ammonia stored will be 30701pounds. Front Range Energy, LLC. has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it relates to the reportable substances.  An emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Front Range Energy, LLC. has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, Front Range Energy, LLC. has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nFront Range Energy, LLC. does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.  This facility started grinding operations on June 6, 2006 and distillation operations approximately 2 days later."
