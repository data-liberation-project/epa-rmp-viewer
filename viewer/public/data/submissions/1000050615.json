Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Tyson Foods Inc to implement a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68. Included in this process is the implementation of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of implementing these programs is to prevent the release of anhydrous ammonia. By doing so we protect employees and guests on site while protecting the general public off site. \r\n\r\nAs part of these programs, Tyson Foods has developed an emergency response plan that includes a well trained response team that coordinates closely with local fire department and other off site emergency personnel.\r\n\r\nII. The stationary source and regulated substance is ammonia. Ammonia refrigeration quantity (87,327 lbs)\r\n\r\nThe food production process at this facility requires very low temperatures to process and maintain the finished product. The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia to provide the proper temperature in the production areas, coolers and blast freezers. \r\n\r\nIII. General accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention.\r\n\r\nA. Tyson Prepared Foods, Dallas has designed and implemented a preventative maintenance program to reduce the potential for release of ammonia from the refrigerations system. This program complies with the requirements of OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management. The key concept of this release prevention program is employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment and appropriate training of all Tyson Team Members.\r\n\r\nThe PSM Team is responsible for conducting and implementing findings from the PHA Process Hazard Analysis for the ammonia system. Team members are also members of the facility emergency response team. This ER Team has developed an Emergency Response Plan which includes specific procedures and equipment to allow the safe response to"
