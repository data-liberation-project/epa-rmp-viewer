OSHA and EPA consider chlorine a hazardous chemical.  The hazards of chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the use and handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is IAWC policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner chlorine is handled and used, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design along with operating procedures and the training of our personnel.     \n\nThe emergency action plan is based upon OSHA 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans) 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) and experience obtained from community drills.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at this location is 2,400 pounds.  The chlorine is delivered by truck in 150 pound cylinders.  Liquid chlorine is added to water by evaporating chlorine liquid to gas, metering the gas through an injector, and then diffusing the gas into the flow stream of water at the point of application.\n\nTHEORY OF OPERATION \nThe Cairo plant chlorinators and accessories are designed to control and indicate the rate of flow of chlorine to provide a simple means setting the feed rate at any value within the range of the machine, to mix the chlorine gas with water, and to deliver the resultant solution to the point of application.\n\nFrom the vacuum regulator-check unit, gas under a controlled vacuum passes through a rotameter (feed rate indicator) causing the float to indicate the rate of flow in pounds per 24 hours on a large, easily read scale. The rate of flow is controlled by the position of the variable orif"

      "SummaryText": "ice across which a constant differential at less than atmospheric pressure is maintained by the operation of the differential regulating valve.  From the differential regulating valve, gas passes to the injector where it is mixed with water.  The resultant solution is discharged to the point of application.\n\nThe function of the injector is to produce a vacuum to draw gas from the chlorinator and to mix this gas with the water flowing through the injector.  A ball check and diaphragm check are built into the injector to prevent a back flow of water into the chlorinator if the injector water supply is shut off with pressure on the injector discharge or if the injector discharge line is restricted.  Proper operation of the injector is dependent on the inlet pressure being sufficiently higher than the discharge pressure.  In the chlorinator, the differential regulating valve throttles the injector vacuum to maintain a constant drop across the variable orifice.  Thus the flow through the orifice is entirely a function of the size of the orifice as determined by the position of the rotameter as manually, or scada set by the operator.\n\n3.1  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThis facility and process uses design codes and standards from the Chlorine Institute, Capital Control Manuals, American National Standards Institute, American Society for Testing and Materials, and applicable state codes and regulations.\n\n3.2  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n3.3  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe written emergency response program as mentioned in the opening paragraph is located at the facility with an ongoing training program.\n\n3.4  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAlthough there is no immediate plans for changes to improve safety at this facility, we constantly review advancement in safety and process technology for the continuing pursuit to provide a safer workplace"
