The facility operates 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.  The site consists of 155 acres, 39 of which are developed.\n\n\n\nAcetaldehyde is the only material present on the plant site above the threshold quantity for RMP planning (10,000 pounds).  Acetaldehyde is used in the manufacture of flavoring and/or frangrance products.  The maximum quantity of acetaldehyde is limited by administrative procedures and storage capacity. Acetaldehyde is stored in two locations; tank T-1144 (8500 gallons), and one or more railcars (28000 gallons/railcar).\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario would result in an off-site impact.  Administrative controls and mitigation measures such as operating procedures and emergency response programs are in place to limit the impact distance and severity.  Alternative release scenarios were considered via Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in accordance with PSM regulations.  The most likely scenario would be a vapor cloud fire from equipment associated with the production process. The facility has an emergency response plan designed to respond to and mitigate the release scenarios identified in the PHA.  The plan has been reviewed and modified as necessary to coordinate with the community's emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nThe electronic database does not allow for the selection of the correct units for alternate release scenario 'vapor cloud fire' quantity released (5.4). The RMP*COMP model calculated a release rate of 7010 lbs/min; however, the database does not allow the user to change the units to match the modeled results. Therefore, the quantity released in the alternative release scenario should be read as 7010 lbs/min, not 7010 lbs total.\n\n\n\nThere have been no events involving aceta"
