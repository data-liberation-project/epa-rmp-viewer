Lake Charles Chemical Complex\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) located in Westlake, Louisiana uses natural gas and by-products from refinery operations to produce specialty chemicals for detergents and cosmetics. The chemical complex uses or produces several regulated flammables such as ethylene, propane, butane, propylene, ethane, butane, hydrogen, methane, and pentane. Chemicals maintained on site at the LCCC listed on the EPA's list of toxic chemicals and are above EPA's threshold quantity are Chlorine, Ethylene Oxide and Hydrogen Fluoride. Other regulated chemicals used in our process, which are stored below the threshold quantity, are Sulphur Dioxide and Ammonia.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe LCCC (Lake Charles Chemical Complex) maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the chemical complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the chemical complex.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure"

This information is supplemented by documents that address known corrosion concerns and known hazards associated within inadvertent mixing of specific chemicals. For the different process areas, the chemical complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, composition, etc.). The chemical complex ensures that the processes are maintained within the limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems, and highly trained personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chemical complex also maintains an electronic database, that is accessible by both employees and contractor supervision, which provides information about the design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical classification, etc. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a comprehensive program to help ensure the hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systemically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe LCCC primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations and the What-if/Checklist method for Process Hazard Analysis revalidations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measure"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineers' work together to develop and maintain operating procedures. These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed. At the Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC), operating procedures: (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. Operating procedures include:\r\n\u00bf\tSteps for safely conducting activities\r\n\u00bf\tApplicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\r\n\u00bf\tSafety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment required and steps to take if exposed to a particular chemical.\r\n\r\nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long standing safe work program in place to ensure worker safety. Examples of the program include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedures to conduct spark producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a  confined space. These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so similar incidents can be prevented. The LCCC trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. The investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. Depending on the incident, an investigation team may be formed. Results of the investigation are documented and appropriate changes are made.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) maintains a written employee participation program to help ensure that safety and environmental concerns of the plant workers are addressed.
