      "SummaryText": "BWWP WHITLOCK WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Board of Water Works of Pueblo, Colorado City of Loveland, Colorado (BWWP)\ntakes an active approach in maintaining and improving chemical safety.  The BWWP has\nemphasized its commitment to safety by holding monthly shift meetings emphasizing\nsafety, and have been rewarded in this approach by having no accidental releases of\nchlorine or anhydrous ammonia within the last five years.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance\nThe Whitlock WTP is located at 1920 West 11th Street, on the west side of Pueblo near the\nArkansas River.  Chlorine and anhydrous ammonia are used at the WTP to provide\ndisinfection of the public water supply.  The primary and filter plant chlorination processes\nstore chlorine in one-ton cylinders, and no more than 30 cylinders of chlorine (60,000\npounds) are stored at the WTP, 26 cylinders (52,000 pounds) in the primary chlorination\nprocess and 4 cylinders (8,000 pounds) in the filter plant chlorination process.\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored within four 2,000 gallon storage tanks for a maximum\nstorage capacity of 8,000 gallons (35,200 gallons).\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nThe worst case release scenario for both the primary and filter plant chlorination\nprocesses involves the loss of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a single cylinder of chlorine\noutside of any enclosure.  The rule for worst case release analysis assumes all of the\ncontents are released in 10 minutes.  The alternative case release scenario for both the\nprimary and filter plant chlorination processes was based on accident history at the site,\nprocess hazard analysis, and experience at similar facilities, and involves the release of\n1,550 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes as a result of a crack in the cylinder caused by\na drop from a forklift.  The distance to endpoint for both scenarios were analyzed using\nRMP*Comp, and the analyses resulted in a worst case release"

      "SummaryText": " scenario distance to\nendpoint of 1.3 miles and an alternative case release scenario distance to endpoint of 0.2\nmiles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia process involves the loss\nof 8,800 pounds of chlorine from a single anhydrous ammonia storage tank in 10 minutes.\nThe alternative case release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia process was based on\naccident history at the site, process hazard analysis, and experience at similar facilities,\nand involves the release of 4,350 pounds of chlorine in 30 minutes as a result of a pump\nseal failure on the tanker truck during filling operations.  The distance to endpoint for both\nscenarios were analyzed using RMP*Comp, and the analyses resulted in a worst case\nrelease scenario distance to endpoint of 1.2 miles and an alternative case release\nscenario distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe accidental release prevention program complies with the requirements for Program\nLevel 2 processes.  The prevention program includes an employee training program\nbased on the written operating procedures for the WTP, as well as a maintenance,\ninspection, and testing program for equipment utilized within the covered processes.\nThese programs all serve to prevent or minimize unintended releases of chlorine and\nanhydrous ammonia.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe WTP has not had an accidental release of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia within the\nlast five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe WTP is included within a written community emergency response plan, and the\nprimary responder to the WTP is the City of Pueblo Fire Department.  WTP employees\nhandle incidental releases of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia and are trained and\nequipped to do so."
