      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt Tremco Incorporated, Mameco Division, we are committed to the protections of our employees, our neighbors and the environment through the proper installation, and responsible operation and maintenance, of our equipment. We achieve this objective through the commitment of personnel and financial resources to improve release prevention and the integrity of our equipment. Additionally, we are committed to the ongoing process of emergency planning and coordination with the local authorities. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have implemented.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Mameco Division of Tremco Incorporated manufactures caulks, sealants and weatherproofing materials used by the construction and residential communities. The products are manufactured using a variety of materials and simple blending and packaging operations. Many of the products produced are polyurethane based. In some of the processes, toluene diisocyanate (TDI) is used which the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequence in the event of a significant accidental uncontrolled release. The facility stores the TDI in a storage tank that is located in an enclosed building. The TDI is pumped to three blending kettles where it is reacted with polyols and other materials. The finished products that are produced contain only very low residual levels of TDI.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility employs a combination of technology, a proactive management approach and employee training to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. The combination of these elements along with management systems provide for a successful release prevention program. Some of the spill prevention improvements that the facility has undertaken include the installa"

Additionally, the facility is committed to compliance with all safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had no significant accidental releases involving materials covered under EPA?S RMP rule during the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe site maintains and updates an Emergency Prevention and Response Action Plan and an Emergency Response Contingency Plan which consolidate all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response preparedness and planning. Our program provides the essential planning and training requirements for the effective protection of our employees, neighbors and the environmental during emergency situations. Additionally, we ensure that our plan is coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility has a philosophy of continuous improvement and is constantly looking for and implementing changes to the operations to minimize potential unplanned release. The facility has committed to conducting a comprehensive engineering and safety review of all of the site processes to identify opportunities for improvement."
