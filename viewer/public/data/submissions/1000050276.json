Our process starts with various types of recyclable aluminum that is received, segregated and blended to create specialty blends of aluminum to be purchased by customers for many uses. The facility is approximately 17 acres of land and is equal in elevation to most of the surrounding county, with very few neighbors or businesses in the area. This plant is manned 5 days a week by experienced supervisors and operators under the direction of the plant manager.\n\n\n\nA designated storage and operations area occupies the site on the west side of the facility with capacity to hold 8 one-ton cylinders, containing 2000 pounds of chlorine each.\n\n\n\nChlorine is a safe and effective purification method used in the aluminum manufacturing process, however, chlorine in a gas or pressurized state has potential to be extremely hazardous if not properly handled by trained and experienced personnel.\n\n\n\nChlorine Gas safety systems consist of relief valves (PRV-101) and leak detection systems that has an alarm point lower than the OSHA (PEL) Limits for the industry.\n\n\n\nEmployees that handle chlorine at the facility receive extensive training prior to working with the chemical and are actively involved and up to date with safety practices.\n\n\n\nAs of June 21, 1999 the Environmental Protection Agency requires that chlorine in quantities over 2500 pounds must have a written RMP program.\n\n\n\nCustom Alloy's facility is included in the Community Emergency Response program. In the event of a significant hazardous chemical release, Custom Alloy will contact Linn County Fire Department. Guidelines are in place to ensure that any hazardous chemical (HAZMAT) emergencies are handled in a manner current with 40 CF"

      "SummaryText": "R part 68 and 29 CFR 1910.1000 regulations and facility safety practices. \n\n\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have been 2 accidental releases which resulted in minor injuries.  The first incident occurred August 4, 2014 around 2:30pm.  The process is chlorine injection during melting of scrap aluminum (NAICS 331314).  Gaseous chlorine was released due to injection tube part failure.  The release lasted about 2 minutes which equates to about 1 lb released.  The on-site impact was that 5 employees were subject to inhalation of low concentration chlorine gas.  There was no offsite impact.  Emergency services responded to the incident and provided oxygen breathing treatment to the employees.  The second incident occurred June 29, 2015 around 3:00am.  The process is chlorine injection during melting of scrap aluminum (NAICS 331314).  Gaseous chlorine was released due to a leak in the connection to the injection gas tube.  The employee was working on the connection and was not wearing his respirator.  The duration and quantity of the release is unknown, but it is estimated that it lasted less than a few minutes.  The on-site impact was that 1 employee was subject to inhalation of chlorine gas.  He was sent to the hospital to be checked out.  There was no offsite impact and no offsite responders were notified.  We have been working with the manufacturer of the chlorine injection tubes and have implemented changes which have improved the seal between the chlorine injection tube and the nipple that goes into the top of the tube.\n\n\n\nBefore the end of 2017, there are plans to install a new Emergency Shutoff System for the chlorine process."
