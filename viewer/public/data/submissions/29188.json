Only properly trained lab employees perform work of connecting the cylinders to the system.  An Emergency Response Plan has been developed and an emergency response team has been trained to respond in case of an accidental release.  Plant Yates has never had a reportable release of chlorine.  As required by EPA regulations, this Risk Management Plan contains Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios for the release of chlorine.  EPA's April 1999 Guidance for Offsite Release Analysis states that since worst case scenario distances are based on modeling conditions that are unlikely to occur, and since modeling of any scenario that results in large distances is very uncertain, EPA strongly urges communities and industry not to rely on the results of worst case modeling or any modeling that results in very largetoxic endpoint distances in emergency planning and response.  The alternative scenario models for Plant Yates show that an accidental release of chlorine will not leave the plant site and will not effect any public receptors."
