      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at ABL\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Airborne Laser (ABL) project to reduce the risk of accidental releases of chlorine, a USEPA-regulated substance. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of releases of highly hazardous materials.\nAs stated by Jim Albaugh, President of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, ?Considering the criticality and complexity of our products and systems, quality and safety are core values for every one of us. Emphasis is shifting from detection to the prevention of problems and hazards through a systematic approach to quality and safety. This emphasis, starting with design and development, continues through procurement, manufacturing, and operational/customer support.?\nThis emphasis on safety is implemented by the Boeing Safety, Health, and Environmental Affairs (SHEA) organization, which develops and assembles USEPA/CalARP RMPs and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plans, in coordination with the facility involved. The facility manager implements the RMP and PSM programs, fulfilling the Boeing commitment to protect workers and the community. The SHEA emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) and the surrounding community, and are in compliance with the USEPA/CalARP and OSHA requirements.\nABL and Chlorine Handling\nThe ABL Program is part of a Missile Defense Agency program comprised of the United States Air Force, the Boeing Company (Integrated Defense  Systems),  Northrop Grumman, and the Lockheed Martin Company. ABL is located at the Edwards AFB, CA, South Base Birk Flight Test Facility (BFTF). Edwards AFB and BFTF feature controlled access for 24 hours a day.\nChlor"

      "SummaryText": "ine storage is performed at the Integrated Maintenance Facility (IMF) Building, located approximately 1.2 mile east of the BFTF.  Chlorine is used as a laser reagent at the System Integration Laboratory (SIL), located at the BFTF. Computerized programs control test conditions, including stopping the test if parameters fall outside preset ranges (an active mitigation measure).  Personnel monitor tests from inside control rooms. \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of chlorine releases in accordance with the OSHA PSM rule. This program is based on the following key elements:\n?    High level of training of the operators\n?    Preventive maintenance \n?    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with participation of the operators\n?    Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n?    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), chemical-resistant suits, face goggles and face shields, awareness of  chlorine hazardous properties, and presence of  chlorine detectors and scrubbers.\nFive-Year Accident History\nNo accidental releases from chlorine  processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage (40 CFR 68.42) have occurred at ABL in the past five years.\nEmergency Response Program\nAn ABL Emergency Response Plan is in place; this includes alert systems, notification procedures, and evacuation plans.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are planned to be conducted periodically.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at the start of a new test series.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHA) of th"

      "SummaryText": "e chlorine systems were performed, using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) procedure.  They were completed in November 2004. Action items requiring replacements or modifications, review, or further investigations, were identified and addressed. These included technical items, such as installation of new mitigation or control equipment, and procedural/managerial items, such as improved maintenance or training."
