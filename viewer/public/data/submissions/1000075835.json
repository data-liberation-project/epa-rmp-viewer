The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities. Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs. These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department. In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group, Inc. to evacuate employees and allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. If an ammonia release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter In Place plan would go into effect. \n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the systems. In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc. Maintenance Manager and/or their supervisor. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility is located at 2916 South Reed A"

The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of wine products. In order to conduct operations, the facility uses approximately 23,800 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within one, closed-loop system (Main System). The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\n-Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n\n-In depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n\n-Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n\n-Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n\n-Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel a"

On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study on January 24, 2019, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet this criteria in the past five years (January 2014 - January 2019). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation. The Wine Group, realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet such criteria. We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and internally investigate and correct the causes of such releases.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, conducted for the various regulated processes on site provided mitigation measures to improve safety at The Wine Group - Sanger, California facility.
