The storage and handling system consists of a\r\nstorage tank(s), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted\r\nto authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is\r\nsecurity-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA\r\nregulations.\r\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state\r\ncodes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\r\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National\r\nStandards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational\r\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\r\nAmmonia\".
