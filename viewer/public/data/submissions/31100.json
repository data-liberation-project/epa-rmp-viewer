For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit-specific Process Safety Information (PSI) document.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, pressure relief settings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) is now incorporated into the HAZOP to produce a more quantitative analysis.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Philtex/Ryton has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nPhiltex/Ryton uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Philtex/Ryton periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nPhiltex/Ryton maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

In addition, Philtex/Ryton evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Our primary contractor received STAR status from OSHA in 2002.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nPhiltex/Ryton conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nPhiltex/Ryton has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

This management system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, personnel and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nPhiltex/Ryton promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a Management of Change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Philtex/Ryton incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nPhiltex/Ryton has developed a team-based defect elimination process known as PRIDE (Philtex/Ryton Integrated Defect Elimination).  The objective of this employee driven process is to eliminate equipment failures through predictive and preventive maintenance and this effort has reduced failure rates by 20% for critical equipment.  As this process continues to take hold we expect continuous improvement in operating reliability and safety. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nPhiltex/Ryton has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

The seven Philtex units of the plant produce specialty chemicals such as organo-sulfur compounds, high purity hydrocarbons, solvents and diversified chemicals. One of the seven units no longer handles ethylene (a regulated substance) and therefore was taken off the submission for the Risk Management Plan.  The Ryton unit of our plant produces plastic (the Ryton unit does not contain a regulated substance covered by the Risk Management Program regulation).  The chemical plant has several regulated flammables (i.e., propane, butane, butadiene, propylene) and toxics (i.e., hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, methyl mercaptan, allyl alcohol, piperidine).    \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Philtex/Ryton plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updat"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation element of the Philtex/Ryton Risk Management system and in the employee participation section of all other risk management elements.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process safety and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.  \n\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the employee behavioral safety process and OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  This award recognizes Philtex's use of a behavioral-based safety process (POWER, People Observing Work, Eliminating Risk).  This employee driven process along with other safety efforts has reduced our total recordable injury rates from 1.50 (1999) to .49 (2003).  Our Plant became a STAR site in 1999 and in 2003 OSHA re-certified our site as STAR (Star amoung Stars).\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Process safety information reference documents are readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.  \n\nChem"
