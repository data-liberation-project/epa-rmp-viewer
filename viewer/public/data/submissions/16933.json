Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the MI College Water Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses disinfection of drinking water  We will  have one regulated substance present at our facility  This substance is chlorine Chlorine will be used to disinfect the drinking water\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility will be 8000.00 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from chlorination of water.  In this scenario 8000 lb. of chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 55 % of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed"

      "SummaryText": ", the maximum distance of 4.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from chlorination of water.  The scenario involves the release of 400 lb. of chlorine.  The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 20 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.2 miles.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility will take all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "
