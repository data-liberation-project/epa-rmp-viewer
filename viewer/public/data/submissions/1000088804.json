The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment function as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Hamlin Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This hel"

      "SummaryText": "ng this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Hamlin Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Hamlin Gas Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) supply contractors with a process overview, (6) information about safety and health hazards, (7) emergency response plan requirements and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Hamlin Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Hamlin Gas Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\n\r\nThe Hamlin Gas Plant conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in"

      "SummaryText": "team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Hamlin Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidated the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings form these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Hamlin Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Hamlin Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive initial training in Hamlin Gas Plant operations. After successfully completi"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer LP has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Hamlin Gas Plant, located in Fisher County, Texas operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from oil and gas wells. The Hamlin Gas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane, pentane and butane which are regulated flammables. The Hamlin Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Results\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full inventory of the largest process vessel (V-410) containing 276,600 pounds of NGL. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.5 mile. No passive mitigation measures were considered in evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Hamlin Gas Plant facility has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention progra"
