This is accomplished by a well-developed, up-to-date and implemented Risk Management Program. All VCS facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner. It shall be the responsibility of the plant manager to ensure that all procedures are followed as set forth in our Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs. In the unlikely event of an accidental release, it is VCS policy to immediately call the National Response Center, Local Emergency Response Committee, the local Fire Department and other agency(ies) that may be required. All VCS facilities will have an emergency response team composed of leadership and maintenance employees to assist these agency(ies).\r\n\r\nVertical Cold Storage, La Vista, is a public refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed loop system. Anhydrous ammonia, most commonly known as ammonia, is an excellent refrigerant and is commonly used in most of the world's industrial refrigeration systems. Ammonia has an excellent warning property, its odor. Ammonia's odor is familiar to most people since it is commonly used in household cleaning solutions. Ammonia can be detected as low as 5 parts per million (PPM) and has an average life span of 7 days in the environment before it breaks down to its common elements of nitrogen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nTypical items stored within VCS facilities are raw or processed food items that can be found in your supermarket or local restaurant. Temperatures range between -10 degrees to +45 degrees F. The refrigeration equipment and piping are located throughout the facility. The condensers and related piping are on the machine room roof with the piping to and from the freezers, coolers, truck and rail docks located on dock roofs. The machine room contains most of the large refrigeration machinery and vessels.  In an unlikely event"

It then may be treated and/or vented under controlled conditions.  The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors throughout to help lessen any leaks that might occur and to provide an early alert.\r\n\r\nVCS believes that prevention is foremost.  All VCS facilities are maintained by a staff of trained maintenance personnel. All VCS facilities are maintained by a staff of trained maintenance personnel. Most maintenance staff have undergone Refrigeration training that include operator 1 and operator 2 training as well as HAZWOPER 24. VCS has a Director of Compliance and Safety who is trained in hazardous communication as well as HAZWOPER 40. All the vessels and piping have been installed according to ASME vessel and piping codes and applicable local Building, Fire and Mechanical Codes. \r\n\r\nVCS acquired the La Vista facility in 2022. The facility has been operating at this location for the past 41 years. Within that time the facility has seen no releases from the refrigeration system(s) that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for 29 CFR 1910.38-Emergency Action Plan, OSHA's 1910.119, Process Safety Management and 1910.120 HAZWOPER standards. We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nThe PHA revalidation recently performed for this facility produced eight recommendations to improve safety. The first PHA produced eleven recommendations to improve safety at the Omaha Oakdale facility. Such recommendations included considering the installation of new mitigation and/or controls, equipment and/or technology changes along with administrative and PPE change"
