Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe ChampionX Corsicana Plant (Corsicana), has always had a strong commitment to its employees to provide a safe working environment. This policy is consistent with both the spirit and the intent of our commitment.  The safety of employees, company operations, and the public are management's most important complete compliance with all safety regulations and safety policies.\n\n\n\nEvery attempt will be made to reduce the possibility of accident occurrence by all levels of management. ChampionX Corsicana believes that safety, like quality and housekeeping, can be controlled by motivated supervision.  Therefore, preventable lost time accidents will have an impact on a supervisor's annual salary review, including any bonuses and incentive plans.  Unreported accidents will be considered falsification of company records and will result in immediate discharge.  Lost time accident free locations will be eligible for annual awards.\n\n\n\n2.  The Station Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nChampionX Corsicana operates a specialty chemical plant and manufactures fatty amines and nitrile intermediates.  The principal products are emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, de-emulsifiers, and surfactants.\n\n\n\nWe have nine regulated substances present at our facility as raw materials for processes, which include dimethylamine (DMA), acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen, formaldehyde, methyl chloride (MeCl), epichlorohydrin, trimethylamine (TMA), and hydrochloric acid (HCl).  Acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde, epichlorohydrin, methyl chloride, and hydrochloric acid are regulated as toxic chemicals and trimethylamine, hydrogen, and dimethylamine are regulated as flammable chemicals. The quantity of hydrogen at this facility is below the threshold level of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n \n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specifi"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) Processes Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nChampionX Corsicana maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of the information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. ChampionX Corsicana primarily uses the checklist and HAZOP method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safety conducting activities within our covered processes, ChampionX Corsicana maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emerg"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification in established processes will be conducted as a regular practice at ChampionX Corsicana.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nChampionX Corsicana conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and are conducted at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are documented in a report.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner and are also documented.  The facility will maintain the two most recent compliance audit reports.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nChampionX Corsicana promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  An incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours after the incident, and will involve at least one person knowledgeable of the process involved.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nChampionX Corsicana will issue a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.   Permit shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations; it shall indicate the date(s) authorized for hot work; and identify the object on which hot work is to be performed.  The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nChampionX Corsicana hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Before any contractors are allowed to work at ChampionX Corsicana, they undergo an orientation conducted by the PSM team.  During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related to the contractor's work, the hazards of regulated substances within ChampionX Corsicana, the safe work procedures insisted on by ChampionX Corsicana, and familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out procedures used at ChampionX Corsicana.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and this information includes evacuation routes and assembly points.

Section 7 of the RMP describes existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-regulated processes at ChampionX Corsicana.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.\n\n\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThe facility has not experienced any reportable accidents in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nChampionX Corsicana has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous material, which is in place to protect workers and public safety, and the environment.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response.  The emergency plan has been coordinated with and verified by the Navarro County the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nAt all times there must be at least one employee either on the facility premises or on-call (i.e. available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the responsibility for coordination of all emergency response measures.
