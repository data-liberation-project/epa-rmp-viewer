The Facility Policy\n\n       The owners, management, and employees of Troy Grain Company are commited to the prevention of  \n       any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is \n       prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate any release and    \n       minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n  2.  Facility Information.\n\n       The primary activity at this facility is buying, selling and storing grain and retailing farm supplies\n        including   the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n       Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for crop production nutrients.\n\n       The mximum quanity stored would be 112,000 pounds (56,000 pounds in each of the two 12,000      \n       gallon storage tanks).  \n\n  3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a 12,000 gallon tank\n             over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity release would be 56,000 pounds which represents the\n             volume of a 12,000 gallon tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to \n             the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .74 miles.\n\n        b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a\n             break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is\n             .41 miles.\n\n  4.   The accidental release prevention  program.\n\n         We have implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\n         Anhydrous Ammonia. K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. , \n          and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safet"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n               have caused any deaths, injuries, or evacuations, sheltered in place, property damage, or \n               environmental damage.\n\n   6.   The emergency response program.\n\n          We have:\n\n          a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard. 29 CFR 1910.38.\n   \n          b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n               information as required under SARA Title lll (EPCRA).\n\n          c.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, \n                including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n   7.   Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n         Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaulations are preformed\n          to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.   There are no additional specific anhydrous \n          ammonia safety recomendations for implementation at this time."
