Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands- Claryville Facility at Bob Huber Drive in Claryville, Kentucky complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule (40 CFR Part 68), OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and OSHA Hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) rules (29 CFR 1910.120).  The enclosed Risk Management Plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 as they relate to the storage, handling, and processing of a highly hazardous material - ammonia.  Through our compliance with Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910, we promote overall plant, worker and community safety.  Our Risk Management Program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequence of a significant release of ammonia, including leaks, spills, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  \n\n\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases that may affect on-site workers and off-site populations and environmental receptors, the Company policy is to fully comply with the spirit and the letter of EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).  The Company has developed a formal Risk Management Plan in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.  All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.  The Claryville facility's Risk Management System has clearly defind lines of authority and designation of responsibilities to ensure that the risk management plans are developed, implemented, and revised.  Hillshire Brands' safety and risk programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.\n\n\n\n2.

Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in the facility refrigeration system in a quantity greater than its 10,000 pound threshold, as established in the 112r regulations.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is present as the refrigerant in the plant refrigeration system.  Preparation of the meat products, packaging, and storage operations require refrigeration to keep raw ingredients and products fresh.  The system consists of a high pressure tank, compressors, piping, pumps, chillers, and associated equipment located at various strategic locations throughout the plant.  The ammonia may exist as a gas or as a liquid in different parts of the system.  \n\n\n\n3.  Release Scenario\n\n\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, Hillshire Brands evaluated off-site consequences for releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Both a worst-case scenario and an alternate-case scenario were developed.\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Claryville facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program rules and OSHA safety rules under 29 CFR 1910 for ammonia.  All elements of the accidental release prevention requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for ammonia at the Claryville facility.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system meets OSHA PSM standards (29 CFR 1910.119) and has been audited to the standard as required every 3 years.  The refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  A process hazard review was most recently updated for ammonia on April 27, 2015 using a \"What-If Checklist\" and all identified problems were addressed.

Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases of ammonia have occurred during the last five years that resulted in off-site impacts of any kind.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program at the Claryville facility is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  The plan is coordinated with the Campbell County Emergency Management and the Southern Campbell Fire Department.  The Hillshire Brands response team trains and drills monthly.  Annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan are conducted at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and the fire department where possible.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the fire department and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs part of Hillshire Brands continuous efforts to improve safety of the system, continual evaluation of the current system is ongoing to prevent anhydrous ammonia releases.  Evaluation of existing equipment is evaluated and will be replaced as necessary at the facility."
