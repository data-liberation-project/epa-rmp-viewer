      "SummaryText": "Southland Foods, Inc. is a poultry processing facility that stores and uses a chemical that is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  This Chemical:  Ammonia for refrigeration.  We currently have maximum storage capacity of 18,000 pounds of Ammonia at the Southland Foods Inc. facility.\n\nSouthland believes that the ammonia we store and handle on site has very real and potential dangers.  However, it is important to keep the risks in perspective.  Southland's ammonia storage and handling facilities:\n1.  are properly designed\n2.  have effective operation and maintenance procedures\n3.  employ trained operators and technicians\n4.  periodically conduct safety audits, and\n5.  are constantly upgrading its processes to meet or exceed industry standards.\n\nSouthland also has taken a proactive approach towards coordinating emergency efforts with the Five Star Voluntary Fire Department.  The Coffee County EMA has a copy of our emergency response program and is well trained and prepared to respond to the potential spills and leaks that may occur at the Southland facility.  The Five Star Voluntary Fire Department conducts annual site visits to our facility and is prepared to respond to a possible spill or leak.\n\nA facility which maintains high standards, such as Southland, provides less public risk than a facility that does not provide safe operations.  Southland complies with Federal OSHA rules and guidelines for safe handling, storage and operation of ammonia systems.  We also utilize outside ammonia system experts to periodically inspect our systems integrity, train system operators, and upgrade the system to improve safety.  As a result of Southland's safety program, Southland has had one release of ammonia which resulted in any off site injury or illness in the past five years.\n\nBecause of the large quantity of ammonia Southland maintains on-site, there is a very small probability that there could be off-site consequences if a major leak occurred.  Southland used EPA's"

      "SummaryText": "OCA Guidance to develop a model for off-site consequence analysis of ammonia\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (18,000 pounds in 10-minutes) a 2.2 mile radius around the Southland Facility may have to be notified and possibly evacuated.  According to 1990 Census Data, 267 people in the surrounding community may need to be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.\n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nDuring the past five years Southland has had several small releases of ammonia to the atmosphere.  The largest of these small releases was 980 pounds, which occurred as a result of a leaking high pressure pipe broken during a bad storm..  This 980 pound release was also used to determine an alternative-release scenario, which would result in a release of ammonia that could only travel .1 miles and may, according to 1990 Census Data, require 35 people in the surrounding communicty to be notified that an evacutation may be necessary.\n\nCONCLUSION\nSouthland-Foods believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform the public of the potential dangers and the actions that Southland has taken to minimize these dangers.  Southland has a long-great ongoing relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Coffee County."
