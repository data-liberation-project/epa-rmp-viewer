It is the Facility?s policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out.  As part of this policy, the Facility has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the site and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter.59).\n\nThe Facility is subject to the standards of RMP regulation due to the on-site storage of a Natural Gas Liquid Mix that contains listed flammable substances in excess of the threshold quantity.  The site meets the definition of a Program 1 Source; therefore, under the requirements of the RMP regulation, the following is required of the Facility:\n ?Submit a single Risk Management Plan (Plan) as provided in 40 CFR 68.150 through 68.185;\n ?Analyze the worst-case release scenario (40 CFR 68.25) and submit in Plan (40 CFR 68.165); \n ?Document nearest public receptor is beyond the endpoint distance [40 CFR 68.22(a)];\n ?Document the Five-Year Accident history of the site (40 CFR 68.42) and submit in the Plan (40 CFR 68.168);\n ?Ensure Response Actions have been coordinated (40 CFR 68.10); and\n ?Certify the Plan (40 CFR 68.185).\n\nThis Executive Summary is a part of the Plan submittal as required by the RMP rule under 40 CFR 68.155 and is intended to provide the public with a description of the RMP at th"

      "SummaryText": "e Facility.  Information relating to the components of a Program 1 Source as listed above, will be discussed further in the sections below.  This Executive Summary will also address the additional information listed under 40 CFR 68.155.\n\n1.1 Background\n\nThe Facility is a refrigeration plant that separates natural gas liquids from field gas.  Liquids are stored in a pressurized tank, the contents of which are transported offsite by tank truck.    The storage tank is the regulated process at the site as it stores flammable substances in excess of the threshold quantity.  \n\nThe Vice President of Operations of Greystone Petroleum, LLC (Greystone) has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the RMP for the regulated process at the Facility.  Additional information, including the emergency contact, is provided within the RMPSubmit report.\n\n1.2 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Facility performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impact from an accidental release of the flammable liquid to the surrounding area.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.25, the analysis consisted of evaluating the worst-case release scenario from the 24,000 gallon storage tank.  The analysis was based on the full tank capacity of the flammable liquid spilling instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  The resulting pool would then vaporize resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The Facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The endpoint distance for a Worst-Case Release Scenario from the storage tank is less than the distance to a public receptor since the Facility is located in a remote area of the Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier Parish, Louisiana.  \n\n1.3 Accident Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe Facility has a commitment to the safety of the general public, of the employees and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substanc"

The Facility utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.  \n\nThe Facility is maintained by Brammer Engineering out of Shreveport, Louisiana.  The Emergency Response Action Guide as developed by Brammer Engineering outlines the specific response and reporting procedures during an emergency event for the flammable liquid by operations personnel.  In addition, in cooperation with the Bossier Parish Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), the ability exists to notify the local community in the unlikely event during an emergency with the potential for impact to the public.\n\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Facility is a new site that has just recently started operations; therefore, there is no relevant accident history at this time.  In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, information relating to any accidental release from the storage tank that results in death, injury or significant property damage, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage will be documented for the Facility and provided in future RMP submittals.  The data relating to the incident will include the items listed below.\n ?Date, time and approximate duration of the release\n ?Chemicals released\n ?Estimated quantity released in pounds and percentage concentration by weight of the released flammable substances within the mixture\n ?NAICS code that corresponds to the process\n ?Type and source of the release\n ?Weather conditions\n ?On-site impacts\n ?Known offsite impacts\n ?Known initiating event and contributing factors\n ?Whether offsite responders were notified\n ?Operational or process changes that resulted from the incident investigation \n \n1.5 Audits and Update\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, audits will be conducted periodically to confirm the procedures and practices requi"
