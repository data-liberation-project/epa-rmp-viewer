(EPA RMP Facility ID# 1000-0016-4877)\nCKCC uses anhydrous ammonia and stores greater than 20,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia making the site subject to both the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and the Federal RMP Program under 40 CFR 68. The site is subject to the OSHA and EPA Process Safety Management Regulations. The site has been determined to be a Program Level 3 facility.\nThe RMP addresses the Program 3 requirements of CalARP as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the ?general duty clause? of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP Program 3 requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\nidentify hazards\ndesign and maintain a safe facility\nprevent releases\nminimize the consequences of releases.\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented RMP, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. \nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\nThis RMP applies to the CKCC facility located at:\n750 Metz Road\nKing City, CA.  93930\nLatitude: 360 13? 30?, Longitude -1210 7? 38?\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\nThe CKCC facility is a 111-megawatt (MW) (nominal output) natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant.

Copies of the investigation reports will be maintained on site for a minimum of five years, and will be used during the periodic PHA re-evaluations.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe facility must rely upon the operational expertise and training of its employees (including contractors) at all levels and disciplines to ensure safe operations.

The facility will implement procedures regarding employee participation in the prevention program elements, the hazard assessment, and emergency action program. The written employee participation plan and facility policies will ensure that:\nEmployees at all staff levels are participants in the development and implementation of PHAs. \nEmployees at all staff levels are participants in the development of the prevention program elements, the hazard assessment, and the emergency action program.\nEmployees at all staff levels are given access to PHA data, EAP data, offsite consequence data, plan implementation data, etc.\nManagement of Change\n\nOperational, safety, and environmental issues must be addressed whenever a change occurs at a facility, which involves an affected process or substance. Quite often a change made in one aspect of the process may affect other parts of the process due to facility system integration. Such changes must be reviewed prior to initiation, to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The facility MoC procedures will be used to evaluate all changes to the following types of systems:\nProcess chemicals (delivery, storage, handling)\nControl technology systems (operation rates, chemicals used, by-products or wastes produced)\nEquipment design and construction\nOperations and maintenance procedures\nOther changes to facility equipment or processes\nContractor Safety and Hot Work Program\n\nAcknowledgement and control of open and/or enclosed ignition sources such as welding equipment, cutting and brazing torches, etc., is essential for the protection of workers and the prevention of accidental releases of listed substances.

The facility will develop a Hot Work Permit program, which requires that employees complete the necessary work order and notification forms certifying that the applicable portions of the fire prevention and protection plan requirements are implemented prior to the start of hot work operations.\nHot Work Permits will be required for all types of open or enclosed ignition sources such as grinding, burning, welding, and brazing. Work performed on or near affected processes, or in areas not approved for cutting and welding pursuant to the fire prevention plan must also have a Hot Work permit. The Hot Work Permit is voided when the use of the ignition source results in a hazardous situation, when conditions of its issuance change, or when the work task requiring the Hot Work permit has been inactive for more than a pre-determined time period appropriate for the job task.\n\nThe facility will utilize outside contractors to augment the existing workforce both on a regular basis, as well as during periods of maintenance outages, overhauls and construction. Contractors must comply with the requirements of the Contractor Safety Program. The facility staff has the primary responsibility for ensuring on-site safety and therefore must take the appropriate measures to ensure that all contractors are trained and understand the site specific safety procedures and programs, including, but not limited to:\nWork practices, equipment and process knowledge, and safety procedures necessary to perform the job.\nEquipment and process hazards identified for the task or job.\nEmergency action procedures and knowledge of safety equipment use.\nKnowledge of safe work practices.\nContractors also have a responsibility to inform the facility staff of any specialized hazards which may be introduced while performing their work.\n\nRelease Scenario Data\nThe worst-case rele"
