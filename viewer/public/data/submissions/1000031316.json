      "SummaryText": "BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThe facilities at Price Station are located at the confluence of two pipelines, and are designed to receive, manage and store hydrocarbon liquids that condense out of the upstream natural gas. The two pipelines on Dominion East Ohio's (DEP's) wet gas gathering system, TPL7 and TPL3, will supply Price Station with an expected 300 MMscfd of natural gas from producing wells up to 38 miles away. Throughout the gas gathering process, heavy hydrocarbons will condense from a vapor to a liquid due to the effects of ground cooling. At any time, the flowing fluid in the wet gas gathering system may be a vapor or a two phase mixture of vapor and liquid. To ensure that both TPL7 and TPL3 stay relatively clear of excess liquids, each pipeline will be periodically cleaned by running a device known as a pig through each line. Excess liquids may adversely affect both the flow hydraulics of the pipeline and the operation of downstream equipment.  \r\n\r\nFlow will enter Price Station from the 30 TPL3 through pig receiver PR-105 and from the 18 TPL7 through pig receiver PR-110 at a pressure between 250 and 450 psig. As gas leaves the two pig receivers, the streams converge into a 30 header and the collective flow moves through the Inlet Slug Catcher V-100. The Inlet Slug Catcher has two main functions: the separation of entrained liquid particles out of the gas stream through gravity separation, and the collection of large instantaneous surges of liquids known as slugs.  Slugs are pushed into the facility by pigs or enter the facility naturally due to pipeline flow hydraulics. Once the gas has moved through the Inlet Slug Catcher, the flow will once again split and leave the facility to enter the 30 TPL3 South through Pig Launcher PL-115 and the 18 TPL7 South through Pig Launcher PL-120. \r\n\r\nThe liquid that enters the Slug Catcher will drain into harp-style fingers which provide liquid retention time. Liquid will be removed from the slug catcher by controlling the flow"

A secondary control based on the level in vessel V-100 will override the flow control to ensure the liquid level in the slug catcher does not get unacceptably low. The exiting liquid will flow through control valve FCV-110 and stored in one of three pressurized storage (bullet) tanks (TK-940, TK-945, or TK-950) between 100 and 200 psig. As the liquid pressure is reduced through FCV-110, the temperature will decrease due to auto-cooling affects. Low temperatures in hydrocarbon streams can lead to the formation of ice or gas hydrates. To combat this, the liquid stream will be heated to between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit in an electric circulation heater, E-210, upstream of FCV-110 prior to pressure reduction. The reduction in process pressure just upstream of the bullet tanks will also cause lighter hydrocarbons to separate from the liquid back into a vapor phase in a process called flashing. The vapors that flash out of the storage liquids will be compressed through a Vapor Recovery Unity (VRU) C-230. The single throw, single stage reciprocating compressor will compress the vapor stream leaving the storage tanks back into the gas stream leaving Price Station. The VRU, in combination with the back pressure control/ suction pressure control valve provided as part of the compressor package, will be used to control the pressure on the bullet tanks at the desired set point. The compressor package will also be equipped with a recycle control valve that will control gas capacity by maintaining the inlet and outlet pressures of the compressor within safe operating windows. Liquids stored in the bullet tanks will be pumped through either Loadout Pump (P-930 or P-935), through a meter skid (X-970), and onto a truck for export and further processing. The meter on skid X-970 will provide: a permissive to the Loadout Pumps once certain administrative and safety requirements are met, control the amount of liqui"

The meter skid will also come with a prover loop to allow for periodic calibration and certification of the liquid measurement. \r\n\r\nThe following information describes the safety systems installed at Price Station:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPLC: Each of the two locations that make up Price Station is equipped with a programmable logic controller (PLC).  In addition to controlling the processes within the station, the PLC is programmed to alert the operator and/or shutdown any potentially unsafe operating conditions. The PLC reads data inputted by transmitters and switched installed throughout the facility. If any of the data is outside its normal range, an alarm or shutdown is initiated. Alarms and shutdowns will be initiated based on logic defined within that cause and effects matrix for this facility. The PLC will be installed with a backup uninterruptable power supply (UPS) that will maintain control of the facility for up to one hour after a power failure. Process variables can be monitored both locally and remotely via a human-machine interface (HMI).  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tBeacons will be installed at both locations to give a visual indication of process alarms and shutdowns. An amber beacon will signal an alarm while a red beacon will indicate a shutdown. Blue beacons will be installed both inside of the compressor building and out to let the operator know when hydrocarbons are detected within the building.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tESD: Emergency Shutdown (ESD) pushbuttons will be installed through both sites to allow personnel to force a facility-wide shutdown. Should an ESD button be pushed, all electric motors and heaters will be de-energized, emergency shutdown valves will close, and control devices  will return to their designated failsafe positions. All controls are specified and installed to be failsafe. The truck loading rack will have its own independent ESD button to allow truck drivers or operators to shutdown the loa"

Regulated constituents found in NGL include propane, butanes (n- and iso-), and pentanes (n- and iso-).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThere are many safety programs in place at Price Station to minimize the potential for the accidental releases of NGL considered by this plan.  For example:\r\n- A comprehensive process safety management (PSM) program has been implemented for all NGL process equipment.  This includes visual inspections, periodic mechanical integrity checks, and operator training.\r\n- The NGL storage tanks are registered pressure vessels that are built to exacting standards.\r\n- NGL tank trucks are only loaded during daylight hours on weekdays.\r\n- Administrative controls are used to ensure that the NGL tanks are not filled above the 85% level.\r\n- Excess flow valves are mounted on all storage tank liquid lines.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThis is a new facility, so there is no"

Yearly emergency drills will be held to test the plan under simulated conditions.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nNone currently planned, as this is a new facility.\r\n\r\nAFFECTED POPULATION ESTIMATION METHOD\r\n\r\nAfter determination of distance to the endpoint for the WCS (0.57 miles)and the ARS (0.1 miles), MARPLOT was used to estimate the affected population within the distance to the endpoint.  For the WCS, MARPLOT reported that one dwelling with five occupants would be affected.  A glance at an aerial photo, however, shows that MARPLOT did not include the small, unincorporated, hamlet of Uniontown, consisting of a few dozen houses.  \r\n\r\nSince MARPLOT did not include this area, an alternate method was used.  ArcView shapefiles were obtained from Don Pickenpaugh of Belmont County GIS Department that contained building addresses for all properties in Belmont County.  Names of businesses were used to removed non-residences from the list.  ArcView was used to determine how many were within the distance to the endpoint for the two scenarios.  Wheeling Township census data was obtained from www.city-data.com.  The census data was used to estimate the number of persons in each township household, which is 2.43.  All addresses, with obvious businesses removed, were assumed to be households.  The number of households was multiplied by the average number of persons per household in the township to estimate the number of people affected.  For the WCS, an estimated 240 people lived within the distance to the endpoint.  For the ARS, the estimated value was 8 people within the distance to the endpoint."
