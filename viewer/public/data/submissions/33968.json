The Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of Lee Fertilizer, Inc., are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 85,000 pounds in the facility's single tank.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank, released as a gas, over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 85,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the single storage tank.  The distance to endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 4.5 miles.  The alternative case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a one inch transfer hose, with 2900 pounds released as a gas over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 1.0 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydorus ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers, and storage facilities.  These regulations, administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture, are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History:  There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injur"

Nor, to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements are an on going process at the facility.  Perioidic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
