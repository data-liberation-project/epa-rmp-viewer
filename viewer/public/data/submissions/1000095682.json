RMP coverage, maximum inventories, and offsite consequence assessments were also verified and updated as appropriate. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\r\n\r\nAt Rohm and Haas Texas Incorporated, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  The company/corporate policies are embodied in the numerous EHS and Engineering standards which apply globally.  At Rohm and Haas Texas, these policies are implemented through the site and global EH&S programs. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nOur facility produces acrylic and methacrylic acids and esters using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.   \r\n\r\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxic Chemicals:\r\n\r\nAmmonia\r\nHydrogen Cyanide\r\nChlorine\r\n\r\nFlammable Chemicals:\r\n\r\nFlammable Mixture (Propylene/Propane)\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst and Alternative Case Scenario Selection:\r\nThere is one (1) toxic and one (1) worst case scenario in this submittal.

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\n- Process safety information - All of our processes have comprehensive information that is used to guide the choice of process and control technologies, operating parameters, and inspection intervals for equipment such as pipes, vessels, and protective systems.\r\n\r\n- Process hazard analysis - All processes have been subjected to a rigorous analysis. These PHAs were used to define the scenarios used in this report. The accident scenarios found in PHAs form the basis of additional analyses which allow us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective systems are high enough to protect both our employees and our neighbors.   They also help us target the most important equipment for more frequent inspection.  \r\n\r\n- Operating procedures - Operating procedures include windows for safe operations and guides for trouble shooting which allow operators to keep the processes out of unsafe areas.  Operators are involved in writing, reviewing, and updating operating procedures.\r\n\r\n- Training - Training is based on the operating instructions.  Operators help determine the frequency of refresher training.\r\n\r\n- Mechanical integrity - We have a comprehensive inspection and preventive maintenance system that ensures that equipment maintains its capability to contain the process chemicals.  This system is being continuously improved.\r\n\r\n- Management of change - As an industry pioneer in the management of change, we have a comprehensive, well-institutionalized MOC system.  Employees at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC system.\r\n\r\n- Pre-startup review - The Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is integral to ensuring that any new or modified process is built as intended.  It is the completion of hazard analysis to ensure that the analyses conducted are, indeed applicable to the process as"

RMP/PSM compliance audits are performed every three years. Actions needed are entered into a computer-based action tracking system that automatically tells those responsible if completion of action items is taking longer than anticipated, so that remedial steps may be taken. In addition, annual self-assessments are performed on different elements of process safety.\r\n\r\n- Incident investigation - We also pioneered process safety incident investigations using multiple-cause, system-oriented techniques.  Many technical papers and presentations came from this work.  We continue to investigate process incidents using this technique and other root cause analysis tools so that we can gain all the information from each incident that we can to determine the root cause(s), in order to prevent future incidents and to add to the body of information about each process.\r\n\r\n- Employee participation - Employees participate in all aspects of the prevention program.  Operators are included in Process Hazard analysis as well as help write operating instructions and perform much of the training for new employees.  Operators and maintenance personnel are expected to participate in MOC reviews.\r\n\r\n- Hot work permit - We have had a very effective Hot Work permit, and safe work permit, system.  \r\n\r\n- Contractors - Contractors are picked according to stringent standards of management, competence, and safety.  Contractors are expected to adhere to the same standards of safety that our own employees do.  A monthly management meeting is held to review all contractors' EHS performance. \r\n\r\n- Hurricane Preparedness - The units are shutdown in preparation for hurricanes as outlined in the unit specific Emergency Hurricane Procedure.

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Our responders are trained annually in various interior and exterior fire fighting techniques at Texas A&M University fire school , Hazardous Material Technician response, Emergency Medical Services and Confined Space/High Angle Rescue Techniques.
