To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n* The development of an employee participation program, which includes Kent facility employees from all areas within the plant.\r\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using a What-If Protection Analysis.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system. The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\r\n* Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.

The entire system contains approximately 18,600 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor). The largest vessel is the controlled pressure receiver that operates at 75 psig and can contain as much as 9,100 pounds of liquid ammonia, assuming a 90 percent fill volume.  However, during typical operation, the vessel holds only 4,600 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers and some piping are located outdoors.\r\n\r\n1.2\tProcess Description\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Kent facility is a single-stage system that controls the temperature for the processing and packaging of spreads.  Equipment and piping carry the necessary gas, liquid, and saturated vapor throughout the system.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves (SRVs), engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  SRVs protect the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, accumulators, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with over-pressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as w"

The SRVs are replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\r\n\r\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessels;\r\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel;\r\n* Main ammonia shut-offs have been labeled to allow personnel to stop the flow of ammonia quickly in an emergency.\r\n2.2\tAlternative-case release\r\nThe alternative scenario is defined by a release of ammonia that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, and reaches an endpoint offsite.  \r\n\r\nThe ?Model Plan? scenario was used for this analysis, which assumes a release of ammonia through a ?-inch effective diameter hole in a high side (i.e., 150 psig) pipe or vessel, releasing 91.5 pounds of ammonia per minute.  Because the building can serve as a passive mitigator to this release, passive mitigation1 was used to reduce the release rate and the distance to the endpoint.  Using the specified meteorology contained in the ?Model Plan?, the distance to the endpoint for the ?more likely? release scenario extends beyond the facility?s property boundary.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\r\n* The facility has a sprinkler system in most of the plant;\r\n* Ammonia sensors exist throughout the plant, including four in the main cooler, one in the small cooler, one in the freezer and four in the engine room"

The release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA?s Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (the ?Model Plan?), dated May 1996.\r\n\r\n2.1\tWorst-case release\r\nThe worst-case release is defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the contents of the largest vessel and associated piping (approximately 9,100 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the ?Model Plan? and assuming the facility is located in a rural area, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release extends beyond the facility?s property boundary.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the controlled pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).\r\n\r\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with dual safety relief valves (SRVs) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRVs continued to funct"
