The RMP release prevention program for this facility is in conjunction with the OSHA 1910.119 process safety management program.  The hazard assessment for this process identifies potential off site consequences related to an accidental release of the chemical, anhydrous ammonia that is contained in the process.  A program management system is also in place at the facility that details the lines of authority for overall responsibility of this risk management plan and maintenance of the release prevention program. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PREPAREDNESS\n\nThe Americold Zumbrota, Minnesota (Plant 2305) facility abides by the emergency procedures of OSHA 1910.38 emergency action plan. However hazwoper 1910.120 applies to this facility in the event of a chemical accident that requires emergency response.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with the Zumbrota Fire Department through which Goodhue County has mutual aid established with Minnesota Homeland Security District 1 hazmat response located in Rochester Minnesota.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n\n\nTo save lives.\n\nTo minimize off site impacts and avoid injuries.\n\nTo protect the environment.\n\nTo minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nAmeriCold maintains a safety committee and has employees designated as coordinators for the facility that are identified in the Americold emergency action plan.

Its standard industrial classification is SIC 4222.  The North American industrial classification system designation is NAICS 49312.  This facility stores and distributes a variety of refrigerated food products for its customers. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, vessels, air units and compressor equipment utilizes anhydrous ammonia, a natural refrigerant for the industrial refrigeration system. Changes in pressure through the refrigeration cycle relate directly to changes in temperature of the refrigerant. For example, lowering the pressure of a refrigerant lowers its temperature. Low pressure, (cold) The ammonia refrigerant absorbs heat through storage room air units.  Removal of the heat from the room provides the refrigeration affect.  Removal of ambient heat from products in turn reduces the spoilage and allows for extended storage of food products.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) Refrigerant grade, pure anhydrous ammonia is the chemical in the process.  In low concentrations ammonia is easily detectable and has a pungent odor that makes it ideal as a refrigerant because of this self alarming characteristic. \n\nThe ammonia inventory at the Americold Zumbrota facility is above the Threshold Planning Quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Ammonia is listed and reportable as an extremely hazardous substance, an EHS on the SARA Title III list of lists.  Due to"
