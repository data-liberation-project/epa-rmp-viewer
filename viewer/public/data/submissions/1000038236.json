The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions, nor allow credit for existing mitigation measures that have been identified.  Based on the review conducted when preparing this executive summary, the ARS is considered a more realistic scenario and takes into account actual operating conditions.\n\n\n\nThe following are summaries of the toxic and flammable WCS and ARS modeling at Motiva.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) RMP*Comp Version 2.01 off-site consequence analysis program.  Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the USEPA's and NOAA's MARPLOT Mapping Software, version 5.0.3.  MARPLOT currently uses 2010 U.S. census data.\n\n\n\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for the consideration of mitigation measures in WCS modeling, various prevention measures that are in place should reduce the likelihood of the WCS and its impacts should it occur.  These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n- Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs;\n\n- Routine surveillance by trained operators;\n\n- Various audible and visual alarm and notification systems;\n\n- Responder call-out, incident command establishment and staging, and agency notification, as necessary.\n\n\n\n1.

An estimated maximum storage quantity of 59,631 lbs of hydrogen sulfide can be present at this concentration in the K-478 storage tank.

Toxic Alternative Release Scenario #2 - Hydrogen Sulfide\n\n\n\nAn alternative release scenario for hydrogen sulfide is the overfilling of the K-478 storage vessel spilling approximately 100,000 gallons of sour water over a conservatively estimated 10-minute time period.  Multiple prevention measures are in place to mitigate or prevent this release from occurring and the actual pumping rate in the event of a release would be significantly lower than the modeled scenario.

      "SummaryText": "mining the flammable worst-case release scenario is not a straightforward analysis.  However, a maximum storage quantity of 30,297,948 pounds of a flammable butadiene mixture in storage sphere S-411 has the characteristics of an NFPA 4 flammable substance and is considered to be the flammable worst-case release scenario.  The flammable butadiene mixture is conservatively assumed to be equal parts 1,3-butadiene, butane, isopentane, and pentane.  Assuming the flammable mixture is stored as a liquid under pressure, the catastrophic failure (worst-case scenario) of the S-411 sphere and subsequent vapor cloud explosion results in a consequence endpoint distance of 2.5 miles (4.0 kilometers).\n\n    \n\nMARPLOT was utilized to estimate the population impacted by this accidental release.  This flammable worst-case scenario has the potential to impact an estimated population of 3,143 people (1,309 residences).  Multiple schools including Norco Elementary, Sacred Heart of Jesus, and Bethune High School could be impacted by this scenario.  Bayou Trepagnier, which is a designated scenic stream and is located adjacent to the northern fence line at the storage and treatment area, could also be affected by this release scenario.\n\n\n\n5. Flammable Alternative Release Scenario - Propylene\n\n\n\nThe flammable alternative scenario selected results in an estimated 229,000 pounds of propylene being released over a 25-minute period at the PV-503 propylene storage vessel due to a failure in an 8\" feed line flange that could result in a 2\" leak opening in the flange.  This scenario was selected due to the volume of propylene stored, the pressure at which it is stored, and the location of the storage vessels at the refinery with respect to offsite receptors.  The endpoint distance calculated as a result of this release and subsequent vapor cloud explosion is 0.3 miles (0.5 kilometers).\n\n\n\nThe MARPLOT population estimate indicates this scenario has the potential to impact an estimated population of 159"
