Bonded Chemicals will review and evaluate this standard practice instruction on an annual basis, or when facility operational changes occur that require revision. Effective implementation of this program requires support from all levels of management and employees within the company.  This written program must be communicated to all personnel that are affected by it.  It encompasses the total work place, regardless of number of workers employed or the number of work shifts.  It is designed to establish clear goals, and objectives.\n\n\n\n2.  General.  The importance of an effective work place safety and health program cannot be overemphasis.  There are many benefits from such a program including increased productivity, improved employee morale, reduced absenteeism and illness, and reduced workers' compensation rates; however, accidents still occur in spite of efforts to prevent them.  Bonded Chemicals Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) details the basic steps and planning documents to be used and will be initiated to prepare for emergencies at the Bonded Chemical facility.  These emergencies include accidental releases of toxic gases, chemical spills, fires, explosions, natural disasters and personal injury.

The management's responsibility within Bonded Chemical is to see that this program is instituted and that it is frequently reviewed and updated.  The input and support of all employees must be obtained to ensure an effective program.  The emergency response plans required by Bonded Chemical will be comprehensive enough to deal with all known types of emergencies.\n\n\n\n3.1  Emergency action plans.  When any new emergency action plans are \n\nrequired by a particular OSHA standard, the plan will be in writing, the plan will be completed with 30 days of the new standard. \n\n\n\n3.1.1 Emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route.
