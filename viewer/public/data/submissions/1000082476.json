These audits are used to determine whether the requirements of the RMP rule are in-place.\n\nMEGlobal investigates any incident which has or reasonably could have resulted in the release of a regulated substance. These investigations are intended to determine the situation which lead to the incident and determine corrective action to prevent re-occurrence. \n\nMEGlobal personnel are encouraged and expected to participate in process safety management and incident prevention, to voice concerns and share knowledge. \n\nMEGlobal hires contractor to perform specialized construction and maintenance activities.
