The Risk Management and Process Safety Management Programs are an integral part of our strong commitment to sustaining our involvment in environmental protection and human safety at our facilities.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Prosser, Washington processing facility stores, packs and ships fresh apples and cherries. This facilityemploys approximately 150 people. Activities are conducted at this site during all months of the year.\n\nThe prosser facility uses anhydrous ammonia in the refrigerating process where fruit is stored in bins and packed boxes that need to be quickly cooled and temperature maintained. The general site has two separate non-connected ammonia systems containing 19000 lbs. And 16,300lbs., respectively, for a total of 35,300 lbs. The worst case scenario was developed for the 19,000 lbs system.\n\nThe prosser, Washington site has another single non-connected facility used for the same purpose. This site is under the 10,000 pound threshold and isnot calculated in the worst case scenario or alternatve worst case. The same safety procedures, however are being applied. This site has 7,800 pound of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nZirkle Fruit Co.'s accident prevention/loss control systems and policies involve a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and best-management practices. The OSHA-PSM and the EPA-RMP plans work together to assure that potential on-site hazards and off-site consequences are identified and controlled to the best of our ability, and that the processes are meeting health and safety objectives.\n\nThe RMP Prevention Program is comprised of the 13 elements of OSHA's PSM program: Employee participatio, process safety information, process hazard analysis, management of change, pre-startup safety review, operating procedures"

      "SummaryText": ", hot work permits, employee training, incident investigation, mechanical integrity, emergency planning & response, contractor safety, and audits.\n\nEmployee participation brought together people that knew and understood the system, from practical experience as well as their technical knowledge, to develop the plan. Process safety information is a collection of data that allows us to identify and understand the hazards posed by our invitory. The process hazard analysis (PHA) program was developed by representatives from our skilled work force, our management team, and outside engineering consultants. This analysis identifies potential failures that could result in an uncontrolled release of ammonia.\n\nA system of checks and balances has been established to safely manage changes that need to be made to the processes containing ammonia. This system evaluates safety prior to the work being done, and provides asolid review of the system to ensure it will operate as designed. Standard operating procedures are in place for each operating phase and are readily accessible to those workers who operate or maintain the process. In addition, a policy and procedure are used to assure that proper safety precautions are taken for all personnel performing hot work. The integrity of the refrigeration system equipment is maintained according to recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices adopted directly from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) standards, and according to a well-documented preventitive maintenance program.\n\nAn extensive training program is in place for those employees and contractor involved in working on or around the process and covers operating procedures, health and safety hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices. The facility also has a training program for all employees and contractors regarding the hazards of the chemical and safe work practices to be used. Part of this training includes monthly safety meeti"

All incidents are analyzed, resolved, and findings shared with affected employees. In order to assure compliance with all elements of the prevention program, an audit is conducted every three years including a report of the findings and documentation of any defficiencies corrected.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no accidental releases at the prosser, Washington Facility in the last five years from covered processes that resulted in death's, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite death's, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an emergency action plan that has been coordinated (reviewed) with the prosser fire department and benton county emergency services. Both are members of the local emergency planning committee.\n\nThe plan applies to all zirkle fruit employees, visitors, and suport service contractors performing tasks and activities as part of ongoing operations. The purpose of the plan is to establish policies and procedures for protecting the health and safety of employees, contractors, and visitors, and to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations. The training of employees and contractors includes providing a copy of the plan upon initial employment with Zirkle Fruit facilities and reviewing it for their specific assignment, annual refresher training for current employees, and review for all whenever the plan is changed. In addition, plant evacuation drills are conducted on a regular basis.\n\nThe plan is comprehensive enough to deal with all types of emergencies specitic to the facility and defines the following:\n\nHow to co"
