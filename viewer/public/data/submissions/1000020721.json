The plant has eliminated the use of some regulated toxic materials, including chlorine.\n\nThe facility is subject to the Program 3 prevention requirements of the EPA RMP rule, and to the OSHA PSM rule upon which those requirements were based. The facility reduces the possibility of a fire or explosion through several mechanisms.  Process hazard analyses (PHAs) are done on a routine schedule for the process.  Changes to the process undergo a PHA before  implementation.  The plant has an ongoing inspection program according to American Petroleum Institute (API) standards.  Training programs and operating and maintenance procedures are also routinely reviewed.  Operators are trained and certified initially and on a three-year interval.  The facility has strict policies on controlling hazardous energy during maintenance activities.  In the event of an upset, the facility has relief valves that discharge to a flare.   For work that is performed by a contractor, procedures are in place to evaluate the contractor prior to work and to evaluate the contractor's performance on an on-going basis.  The plant reduces the possibility that a source of ignition might be present by maintaining hot work procedures and through proper classification of electrical equipment.\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nThe plant has had one release of covered flammable materials in the past five years.  The release resulted in significant equipment damage but no plant personnel injuries.  There were no accidents with off-site impacts.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team and incident investigation teams.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element.  In addition the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The facility has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees, contractors and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition).  The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equi"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each part of the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant primarily uses the What If/Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The What If/Checklist analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.   \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Chocolate Bayou plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators, supervisors and engineers as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nAlso safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to the process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chocolate Bayou plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees"

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting.  In addition, the Chocolate Bayou plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  In addition, PSSR's are completed prior to starting up a unit after it has been down for repairs, or a turnaround.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Chocolate Bayou plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has a hot work permit program that details those areas requiring a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.  A permit is required in process areas for all cutting, welding, spark producing equipment, etc. except in designated free burn areas.  The procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot work until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with the hot work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to  management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Chocolate Bayou plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.
