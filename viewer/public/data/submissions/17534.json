When a hazardous substance is used, Equistar considers the potential for this substance which could adversely affect the plant workers, the public and the environment through the management of change and the process hazard analysis processes and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nEquistar strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility: Equistar implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, built, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment. Equistar uses Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.  In addition, Equistar requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the management of change process.
