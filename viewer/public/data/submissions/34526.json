The aqueous ammonia system is monitored during (at least) daily rounds by a PWP employee.  Typically, the Power Plant operators perform cursory facility inspections twice per shift, or six times per day.  Once identified, PWP will fix or outsource any system deviation that is noted.  In any case, a record of the maintenance or work performed on the system is maintained by the Plant Supervisor.\n\nPWP has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Response Program section of the CalARP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n -   To save lives.\n -   To minimize and avoid injuries.\n -   To protect the environment.\n -   To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, aqueous ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to include the use of a foghorn over the Public Address system to indicate the need for an evacuation.\n\nPWP has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Pasadena Fire Department.  In the case of an aqueous ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of PWP to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).  PWP also plans to contract a private company to be available for aqueous ammonia emergency response situations.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe City of Pasadena Water & Power Department Broadway Power Plant is located at 85"

The area surrounding the facility is primarily light commercial and residential.  The facility is surrounded by a chain link fence with locked gates.  Visitors are required to check in with facility personnel upon arrival.\n\nThe Broadway Power Plant Unit B-3 is a 71 MW unit that was placed in commercial operation in 1965.  The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system was installed in 1994.  In 2003, PWP slightly modified the ammonia chemical delivery filling station.  The facility uses aqueous ammonia to catalytically reduce boiler flue gas nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to elemental nitrogen and water.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of aqueous ammonia at the Broadway Power Plant is 12,000 gallons (89,600 pounds).\n\nAqueous ammonia, 29.4% weight anhydrous ammonia,  is used at the City of Pasadena Power Plant in the Unit B-3 Steam Plant Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)  system to help maintain air quality compliance of the emission stack, specifically, reducing NOx (NO and NO2) emissions.  Depending on which fuel is burned, the SCR system provides a reduction efficiency of between 60-90%.  When in operating mode, the aqueous ammonia system is automatically controlled based on system demand.  The aqueous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon tank inside a bermed containment area equipped with a manual drain.\n\nThe liquid aqueous ammonia is pulled from the tank through the ammonia shut off valve by two pumps.  It then travels through double walled piping, underground, to the first level of the Power Plant.  There it flows through a strainer manifold and then travels up to the fifth level where it flows through a back pressure regulator control valve, a flow control valve to the vaporizer and then the injection grid.  The catalyst bed provides the surface area for the SCR reactions to occur.\n\nThe"

      "SummaryText": " ammonia shut off valve remains open based on several permissive conditions including, but not limited to boiler load, reactor temperature, ammonia storage tank level, and metering pump operation.  The aqueous ammonia is mixed with compressed air prior to entering the vaporizer where it is mixed with hot blower air and then fed to either the economizer superheat-side or the economizer reheat-side of the ammonia injection grid in the combustion exhaust stack.\n\nThe NOx in the flue gas reacts with ammonia in the SCR reactor catalyst layers to form harmless elemental nitrogen and water.  The elemental nitrogen and water remain in the flue gas as it passes through the stack to the atmosphere.  The SCR reactor is designed for a NOx reduction efficiency of 89.3% when firing natural gas.\n\nThe SCR system is equipped with various automatic process controls which ensure safe and efficient operation of the SCR reactor, vaporizer, metering pumps, shut-off and regulating valves.  In addition, pressure relief valves automatically engage in the event the system experiences a very high pressure situation.  In case of an ammonia leak, four ammonia sensing devices will provide an alarm locally and in the control room.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe storage of aqueous ammonia at the PWP Broadway Power Plant is governed by many safety features.  Much of the safety of the process is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the process.  For example, the Broadway Power Plant operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The aqueous ammonia system is checked by operators on a daily basis.\n\nThe Broadway Power Plant maintains tight control of its aqueous ammonia system through various process controls and monitors.

There are four vapor detectors located in the following locations at the Broadway Power Plant: Bermed Storage Area, Feed Pump Skid, Vaporizer Area, Catalyst Expansion Joint.  The ammonia sensors activate a local alarm and an alarm in the control room that is always manned.  The liquid sensor is located in the Underground Secondary Containment area.  All ammonia detectors provide an alarm to alert operators.\n\nOther automatic protections that are designed to mitigate or prevent a release of aqueous ammonia include: a containment berm surrounding the aqueous ammonia tank sized to hold the entire contents of the tank, double walled piping from the pump discharge to the stack, and a valve that will automatically engage to relieve pressure or vacuum (negative pressure) in the tank.  The pressure relief/vaccum breaker setpoints are 25 psig/-0.125 psi.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the previous five years (since June 1999), there have been no aqueous ammonia accidents at the facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPWP has an emergency action plan in effect.

Hand-held ammonia detectors are utilized by the operators during the ammonia filling operation and other operations as needed.  They are referenced to determine the local ammonia concentration if there is an odor of ammonia.  Above 40 ppm, the operators are instructed to leave the area and contact the authorities.\n\nThe facility is also part of a city-wide emergency protocol called the Emergency Operations Center, or EOC.  Developed by the State of California, standardized operating procedures have been established to deal with large-scale emergencies.  These methods include financial accountability, mutual aid agreements, decision-making strategies, etc.\n\nEmployees are trained to respond to small spills and incidents.  For large spills or incidents, staff are instructed to notify, evaluate hazards, contain the leak or spill (if safe), shut off feed valves (if possible) and evacuate the area.  For large incidents, the local emergency responders would be notified and brought in to assist.  PWP staff would then provide technical support to the local emergency responder's Incident Command System (ICS).  The IC for the City of Pasadena is the Fire Department.  Pasadena FD is a member organization that would be called in to respond to a chemical release or incident.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  A compliance audit was conducted at the facility in 2004 that generated recommended action items to improve safety at the facility.
