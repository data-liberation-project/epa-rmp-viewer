The plant was originally operated by Bridgeline Gas Distribution LLC, a subsidiary of Texaco Exploration and Production The plant was included in the initial RMP for the Texaco Henry Complex, Henry, Louisiana. The plant contains regulated flammables, such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL). The main components being Ethane, Propane and Butane within its process areas.  \n\n OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for the Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE), involving 167,776 pounds of a flammable mixture contained in the Product Surge Drum. Although administrative controls are in place to limit this quantity, those controls were not considered in calculating this maximum quantity determination. The entire inventory of the storage tank is assumed to release, forming a vapor cloud, igniting and exploding - creating a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE). Using EPA' OCA Guidance Reference Tables, the maximum distance to the 1 psig overpressure endpoint is 0.4 miles (2,336 feet). Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases, and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) that will be used as a planning case for the Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant is a product pump seal leak considered the equilvalent of an 0.50 inch hole diameter, causing a release of gas mixture stored under pressure as a liquid, to the atmosphere at a rate of 328 pounds per minute. This particular ARS is assumed to last for 10 minutes before operation of the isolation valves, pumps, fire monitor cooling water and/or other mitigating actions can be utilized to mitigate the release. Under this ARS, the released material is accidentally ignited -resulting in a fireball. Using EPA's OCA Guidance Refere"

With a radius of 0.08 miles, this ARS would extend outside of the Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant approximately 286 feet. This scenario extends off-site but does not impact a public receptor. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency response planning.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcesses at the Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes. The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the plant.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documentation and chemical information, to participating as members of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigations, development of operating and maintenance procedures, participation in safety meetings. The PHA teams typically have members from various departments of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, safety and environmental, and plant management. Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The plant ensures that the process is maintained within proper operating limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems. The plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment, materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings as well as the electrical ratings of the equipment. \n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\nThe Sea Robin Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Sea Robin Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) methodology to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of plant employees who have operating and maintenance experience in the process as well as representatives from engineering, safety, technical support and management. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk rating, receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. The reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and  (6) initial startup of a new operation or after maintenance activities. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new process operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. These procedures are readily available to operators and other plant personnel to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the plant has implemented a training program for all process operators. New operators receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator works under the supervision of a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they possess adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a "

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors perform work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in the workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they may find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of the contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that they are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\nThe Sea Robin Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Sea Robin Plant follows established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.\nIncident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.

      "SummaryText": "ogram rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety and the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures assures all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities.  \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant has in the past been coordinated with the Henry Volunteer Fire Department. Amerada Hess will continue to coordinate with local emergency responders\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAmerada Hess Corporation has a strong commitment to personnel safety and health.  Extensive efforts are undertaken to incorporate that safet"
