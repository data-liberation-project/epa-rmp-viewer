Ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility. The refrigeration system contains approximately 30,000 pounds of ammonia which exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls. Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded. Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel. The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels. Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE SCENARIOS\nComputer air models were developed based on a worst case release scenario involving the catastrophic structural failure of the system receiver. The receiver can potentially contain the largest quantity of ammonia in a single vessel at this facility. The model was produced using OCA guidance, including RMPComp.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility has developed a prevention program which complies with the requirements of OSHA CFR 29, 1910.119 Process Safety Management. This program includes procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without catastrophic release.\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event. A third party response contractor is notified of an uncontrolled release event. The local fire department has been included in the no"

In all cases, improved process technology is employed where feasible.  Employees levels of awareness is enhanced by regular training programs and exercises."
