Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nADM is continually evaluating options for improving processes and efficiencies in order to reduce the quantities of hazardous materials used and stored at its facilities.  In addition, ADM continually evaluates options at its facilities for replacing hazardous materials with less hazardous or non-hazardous substitutes.  For example, since the original submittal of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for this facility, ADM has modified the facility's operations such that anyhdrous sulfur dioxide is no longer stored on site.  This change was made to reduce the potential hazards to ADM's employees, the community and the environment associated with hazardous chemical storage, and is the basis for this RMP update.\n\nThis facility employs specific safety precautions in handling hazardous chemicals to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community, and the environment and adheres to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safe operations are the result of the precautions used in handling hazardous chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, and the training of personnel.\n\nEmergency response for this facility is coordinated with ADM personnel, the Decatur Fire Department and the Decatur Police Department.  This program includes procedures for notifying the appropriate personnel and agencies in the event of an accident involving a hazardous chemical.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe regulated substance used at ADM's East Complex is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is received by truck and rail and stored in three 308,000 pound storage tanks and rail cars.  At the facility's BioProducts Plant anhydrous ammonia is used for pH control and as a nitrogen source for product fermentation.  Through fermentation processes, this facility produces products such"

Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:  For substances that are normally gases at ambient temperatures but are liquefied by pressure, the worst-case scenario assumes that the single largest ammonia tank fails and the entire contents are released as a gas over a ten-minute period.  Safe handling procedures and work practices, safety devices, and personnel training make this scenario unrealistic.\n\nAlternative Scenario:  A more realistic release scenario involving anhydrous ammonia would be a leak on a liquid line of a storage tank.  Excess flow control valves on the liquid lines were considered in this analysis as they function to close when maximum allowable flow conditions exist.  \n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention\n\nThe key concepts in this facility's prevention programs are the elements of the Process Safety Management Program:  employee participation, process safety information, analysis of hazards, operating procedures and safe work practices, personnel training, contractor programs, pre-startup reviews, maintenance and mechanical integrity programs, hot work permit procedures, management of change procedures, incident investigations, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had any accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that require reporting.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nADM's East Complex has an Emergency Response Program and Emergency Response Plan for responding to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  As part of this program, ADM has personnel trained as Hazardous Materials Technicians who can take measures to mitigate accidental releases.  The Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with facility personnel, the Decatur Fire Department and the Decatur Police Department such that in the event of an acc"

ADM is working cooperatively with the surrounding community and the Decatur Fire Department to improve response capabilities.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of a safety review of this facility's anhydrous ammonia system, it has been determined that no changes need to be made to the system at this time.  However, ADM will continue evaluating options for improving processes and efficiencies in order to reduce the quantities of hazardous materials used and stored at its facilities.  In addition, ADM will continue evaluating options at its facilities for replacing hazardous materials with less hazardous or non-hazardous substitutes."
