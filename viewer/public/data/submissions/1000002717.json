The Facility was purchased from BP Amoco Chemical Company by FHR on May 28, 2004.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nFHR is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  The Facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  FHRs practice is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances to the environment.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\n\nDescription and Regulated Substances    \n\n\n\nVarious chemicals are processed at the Facility to produce materials for polyester fibers, fiberglass gasoline tanks, paints, wire coatings, plastics, insecticides, and food additives.  The only RMP-regulated substance at the Facility in excess of the threshold quantity is butane, which is the primary material used in the Maleic Anhydride (MAN) production process.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  If an incident were to occur, it would be investigated very carefully to determine ways to prevent a recurrence or a similar incident from occurring.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention efforts in place at the Facility.  Because the MAN production process that is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administr"

Examples of employee participation range from compiling and updating technical information to participating as a member of a team that systematically analyzes new and modified processes for hazards.  Teams that represent a good cross-section of levels and areas of the Facility are formed to revise and update safety standards and to investigate accidents and issue reports to appropriate personnel.  Safety focus teams in each area promote individual responsibility for safe work behaviors.  Some individual employees responsibilities include writing operating procedures and Job Safety Analysis (JSA) plans, serving as compliance auditors for the Facility, and serving as members of the Facility's Fire and Emergency Response Team.   Refer to PSM Job Aid PSM-110 Employee Participation Plan for additional details.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains documents describing process safety information for the MAN process.  These documents describe chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and treatments, and emergency response considerations are provided in material safety data sheets.  The process operators use modern instrumentation to assist them in controlling the process within the design ranges. \n\n\n\nThe Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, pipi"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place.\n\n\n\nThe Facility uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized by OSHA as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  A HAZOP study of the entire process unit is completed every five years.\n\n\n\nThe HAZOP team's recommendations for improvement are forwarded to management for resolution.  Recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nRefer to PSM Job Aid PSM-205 Process Hazard Analysis Program for additional details.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFHR maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including such activities as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced process operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new process operators.  Each process unit reviews all operating procedures annually.  The procedures are located in the unit control room for ready-reference by process operators and are av"

Basic operator training is available at local institutions (e.g. Joliet Junior College) and consists of the essentials that process operators need to know about process equipment and controls, regardless of their work location.  Basic operating training either through local institutions and/or through online CBT training is completed before an operator starts the training specific to the process unit.    Unit-specific training is self-paced and is conducted in the unit under the oversight of experienced process operators over a period of several months.  An operator must become qualified on each section of the unit by demonstrating a hands-on mastery of every section task before operating that section independently.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nContractors are utilized at the Facility for construction and maintenance activities.  \n\n\n\nBecause some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  \n\n\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to initiating work.  \n\n\n\nAll contractors must complete the Three Rivers Manufacturing Council Safety Course for contractors before they are allowed to work at the Facility.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are properly prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that construction is completed in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention measures are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nPractices and procedures are under continuous development and improvement in order to effectively maintain pressure vessels piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Procedures at the Facility are controlled, reviewed, and approved in a process separate from the MOC process. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are all updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all personnel involved in the process are provided any necessary training on the change.  This system ensures that all documentation is updated and training is completed prior to the commissioning of the change.  Refer to Facility PSM MOC policies for additional details. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Facility promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental damage, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.

      "SummaryText": "he Facility periodically conducts targeted compliance audits.  A complete audit of the entire PSM program is conducted every three years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Facility include hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The PSM Program summarized previously is applied to the MAN production process (the only EPA RMP-regulated process at the Facility).  Collectively, these program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nIn addition to PSM, the Facility has instrumentation and equipment to detect, contain, and reduce the consequences of a release at and around the MAN production unit and associated butane sphere, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n-    Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n-    Monitoring equipment to detect density, temperature, level, and pressure changes\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n-    Atmospheric relief devices\n\n-    Valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n-    Automated shutdown systems\n\n-    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e., uninterruptible power supply for the process control system)\n\n-    Inert gas purge system\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n-    Containment to contain liquid releases\n\n-    Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n\n-    Deluge system and snuffing steam\n\n-    Trained emergency response personnel\n\n-    Emergency response equipment located onsite\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect workers and the public as well as the environment.

      "SummaryText": " program consists of procedures for responding to a release of an RMP-regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is released.  The procedures address aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and personnel accountability after an evacuation; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs; and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Facility has procedures in place that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes or emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Facility is coordinated with the Will County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which involves local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Facility has the capability of communicating with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments, industrial neighbors, and mutual aid with industry) around-the-clock.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and local emergency response organizations.  Additionally, the Facility provides occasional refresher training to local emergency responders.

      "SummaryText": "afety\n\n\n\nThe Facility resolves all findings from HAZOP studies, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The resolutions and resulting changes are tracked internally to ensure completion.  Findings from the most recent PHA have not yet been formally approved for implementation.  Other changes that have been completed or are being considered for implementation within the MAN unit include:\n\n-    Drainage trenching within the process unit to remove hazardous chemicals spills from the immediate process area;\n\n-    Construction of security fencing around the butane sphere;\n\n-    Updates to MOC program to facilitate transition to an electronic system.\n\nFinally, within the coming months, FHR will be revising the Facility (including the MAN unit) MOC process so that MOC reviews are managed and tracked through an electronic system.  The MOC procedures will be updated to incorporate the revised MOC methodologies.\n\n\n\n"
