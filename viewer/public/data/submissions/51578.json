The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility management has developed an Emergency Action Plan along with training to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\n\nIn order to prevent a potential accidental ammonia release at the Gartner Refrigeration facility, Gartner Refrigeration has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures.  This assists in ensuring the refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and all other local, state and federal regulatory agency safety standards, as well as its own internal standards.\n\nThe management believes that cooperative emergency response with company employees, local emergency responders and regulatory agency people in will provide a safe workplace and a safe environment.  In an emergency, all personnel are instructed to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel as directed by the Emergency Response Incident Commander. \n\nThe Blake Road facility is a refrigerated warehousing facility. The large majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the commonly used refrigerant in industrial grade refrigeration systems that maintain low storage temperatures and can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility operations.  The refrigeration system in this facility contains approximately 20,300  pounds of ammonia inventory for this process.\n\n\nGartner Refr"

      "SummaryText": "igeration is committed to safe management and operation of the closed Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Maintenance employees are trained to observe operational procedures designed to be as fail-safe as possible to prevent accidental release of ammonia at any time.  Should any accidental release occur, all maintenance employees are required to observe safe emergency response procedures.  They are trained to work in conjunction with the local Emergency Planning Commission to minimize the impact of any accidental releases.\n\nAs part of the safety programs in place at the facility, the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan as an integral part of the base safety manual.  The OSHA PSM Program has been implemented and covers the entire scope of safe operation procedures of the ammonia refrigeration system from start-up and normal operations to potential emergency response operations and subsequent clean-up and restoration of systems.  Normal operations rely on the following:\n\n? The Maintenance Management Procedures are used to perform preventative\n maintenance and to maintain records of all maintenance work performed.  This\n helps to ensure that the closed ammonia system continues to work safely,\n reliably and efficiently in the originally intended manner.\n \n? Any set specifications of systems temperature, pressure, level or power \n interruption, that are exceeded or violated will normally trigger an alarm and\n safety shutdown.  Maintenance technicians are notified of a deviation from\n normal operational specifications through indicator or alarm systems.\n \n? In the event of deviations, technicians are trained to analyze the situation,\n follow personal safety procedures at all times, determine that everything\n is under control and correct problems and/or deviations.\n \n? If a problem cannot be corrected immediately, the equipment needing\n repair service will be safely locked out of service until such time as\n repairs have been completed.\n \n? If a problem cannot be safely handled "

Written procedures for emergency operations include emergency evacuation\n procedures, emergency shutdown instructions, emergency response unit coordination \nplans, regulatory agency notification and other pertinent information.\n \n\n\nIt is the intent of Gartner Refrigeration to not only meet any regulatory requirement, but also take a pro-active approach into implementing these requirements as part of a working safety plan.  Gartner Refrigeration is in a constant review process of its operations and industry standards to provide a safe working environment for our employees, customers and neighbors."
