The corporate director of environmental health & safety has been \n\nassigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and \n\nfor ammonia refrigeration safety in particular. \n\n\n\nThe Marshall, MN (Ice Cream Plant) facility manufactures ice \n\ncream.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at \n\nthis facility. Ammonia is the most efficient and environmentally \n\ncompatible refrigerant available. Although it is toxic at high \n\nconcentration and is an irritating gas, it is not a cumulative \n\nmetabolic poison, does not cause cancer or other dread diseases \n\nand does not cause lasting environmental damage. The refrigeration \n\nsystem at this facility contains approximately70,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nSchwan's calculates ammonia worst case release scenarios using the \n\nModel RMP COMP for Ammonia Refrigeration.  All Schwan's \n\nmanufacturing facilities are located in areas that meet the \n\ndefinition of \"urban\".  Schwan's has chosen to calculate worst case \n\nrelease poundage for the largest high-pressure receiver in the \n\nsystem, filled to full calculated hydraulic capacity. Reduced \n\nvolume for administrative controls was not used, since the \n\ndescribed scenario would probably occur only as a result of a \n\ncatastrophic vessel rupture caused by a total filling of the \n\nvessel, closure of all vessel block valves, failure of all \n\npressure relief valves, with a simultaneous increase in liquid \n\ntemperature sufficient to overpressure the vessel to the point of \n\nfailure.\n\n\n\nBased on the above, the worst-case ammonia release scenario for \n\nthe Marshall, MN (Ice Cream Plant) facility will be 27500 pounds \n\nreleased over a 10-minute period. The alternate case will be a \n\nrelease rate of 109 pounds per minute. Both scenarios have off-\n\nsite impacts.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is covered by the OSHA Process \n\nSafety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe Marshall, MN (Ice Cream Plant) facility "
