THE MAXUMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 140,000 POUNDS IN OUR BIG TANK.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A SIMI TRUCK HOLDING 38,000 POUNDS.  3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.  A.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 7,500 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE STANDARD.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .31 MILES.   B.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (OR THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT) IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERION TO 200 PPM) IS .41 MILES.   4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.
