Anhydrous ammonia and liquefied propane gas are two (2) products regulated by Part 68 of the CAA and are in use at this facility above regulated quantities.  Anhydrous ammonia, for retail sales, is stored site in three (3) above ground storage tanks (AST) on concrete cradles.  Two (2) ASTs are 11,000 gallons in capacity (total H20) and one (1) has 12,000 gallons capacity.  Incoming product arrives by semi-bulk truck and rail tank car.  The facility also has two (2) rail cars of 80 ton capacity each and twenty-two (22) nurse trailers {2-1,450 gallons and 20-1000 gallons} The maximum inventory, based on 85% of total H20 capacity, is 620,000 pounds.

      "SummaryText": "gas is stored on site for retail sales and consumed on-site as a fuel for a grain dryer.  Storage is in three (3) ASTs on concrete cradles with 30,000, 18,000 and 12,000-gallons (total H20) capacities.  Propane arrives and leaves by semi-bulk truck.  The 18,000-gallons AST is piped underground directly to the grain dryer.  The total maximum inventory is 220,000 pounds.\n\n(c) The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia: Worst case scenario:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia worst case scenario is the failure of the largest vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (160,000 pounds), resulting in a toxic gas release.  According to Environmental Protection Agency Offsite Consequence Analysis documentation, the distance to the endpoint is 7.30 miles.  The estimated residential population within this distance is 2,000 and public receptors include schools, residences, major commercial, office, or industrial, recreation and agricultural production areas.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia: Alternative case scenario:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia alternative case scenario which reached an endpoint off site is the failure of a vessel {nurse tank} when filled to the greatest amount allowed (6,400 pounds), resulting in a toxic gas release.   EXAMPLE: Tornado or collision shears valve(s) from nurse tank and mitigation devices fail resulting in loss of total vessel capacity.  According to Environmental Protection Agency Offsite Consequence Analysis documentation, the distance to the endpoint is 0.50 miles.  The estimated residential population within this distance is 260 and public receptors include schools, residences, major commercial, office, or industrial, and agricultural production areas.\n\nLiquefied Propane Gas: Worst case scenario:\n\nThe liquefied propane gas worst case scenario is the failure of the largest vessel when filled to the greatest a"
