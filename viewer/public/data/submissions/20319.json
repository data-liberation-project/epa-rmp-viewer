This commitment demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Our emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of trained personnel to respond, control and contain the release. Opal Plant is in  compliance of Process Safety Management and of the elements of PSM are in place at the Opal Plant.\nOpal Plant has an Emergency Policy/Procedure manual. This manual and its procedures are updated as needed and annually. The local Emergency Management is located in Kemmerer Wyoming. The plant works closely with this agency and keeps them up to date on our Emergency Plan. \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Opal Plant operates a cryogenic gas liquid extraction process This process consists of 3 cryogenic gas plants. Commercial grade Methane is produced by extracting Propane, Butane, and flammable mixture of natural gas liquids from the inlet gas stream of unprocessed natural gas. The Opal plant also is equipped with a load out facility.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe first worst case scenario with a release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion involving a rail car full of propane at our load out facility. \nThe amount released would be 36,000 gallon of liquid propane or 152,000 pounds. The distance to a 1psi over pressure (ENDPOINT) would be .4312 miles. The second WCS is the inlet liquid slug catcher had a release. This product would be Pentane. The amount released would be 304,000 gallons or 1,584,000 pounds. The (ENDPOINT) is .9417 mile. There are procedures,"

The facility also is equipped with a deluge fire water system.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substance at Opal plant is a vapor cloud explosion resulting in the release of propane from a ruptured loading hose at the load out facility. The release would be 1939 gallons or 8195 pounds. The (ENDPOINT) for this release is .1654 miles. There are procedures, employee training, gas detection alarms and shutdowns to help prevent this from occuring. \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program: \n\n\nOpal Plant encourages employee participation in all aspects of Process Safety Management and Accident Prevention.  Employee's participation ranges from updating and compiling technical data for Operating Procedures and Process Safety information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis team.  In addition, Opal plant has a number of initiatives that address Process Safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety, the teams typically have members from various area of the plant, including operations, maintenance, technicians, and plant management. Opal plant has a written safety program.\nOpal has an Emergency Policy/ Procedure manual. The plant works closely with the Lincoln county Emergency Management and the local LEPC of Kemmerer Wyoming.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOpal Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis information.  This information, in conjunction with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process"

Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nOpal Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up,  (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, (7) start-up after turnaround. (8) Upper & lower alarm set points and deviation. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are reviewed and verified as current and accurate annually.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nOpal Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment we have procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing them with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements and safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  Opal Plant personnel periodically conduct safety audits on contractor performance to ensure that they are working in a safe manner.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews:\n\nOpal Plant conducts a PSSR on any Plant modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The Opal plant attaches a PSSR anytime an MOCR is origi"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR uses a checklist to verify the modification readiness; it involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verifications that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nOpal Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include employee training, developing written procedures, performs inspection, and testing, correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures.  Collectively, these activities form a system that maintains the Mechanical Integrity of the process.\n\nSafe Work Practices:\n\nOpal has established safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety, examples of these include, control of the entry, presence and exit of support personnel, Lockout/ tagout to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance.

      "SummaryText": "ey are not already familiar with such operations, after successfully completing this training a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner they can work independently, this is measured with test questions and skill demonstration.  In addition, all operators receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level, this refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, all training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nOpal plant has a comprehensive system to manage change to all covered processes, this system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Process operating limits equipment information as well as procedures we update to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nOpal plant employees along with management promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in a fire / explosion, gas release, property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
