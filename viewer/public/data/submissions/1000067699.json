Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs.  Enable Midstream Partners mitigates risks of accidents and accidental releases by paying particular attention to: personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes, just to name a few.  Enable Midstream Partners' policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, in the rare instance that a release were to occur, gas plant operating personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream Partners' emergency response procedures in an effort to safely avert further product gas release. \n\n    \n\n    DESCRIPTION OF THE WHEELER GAS PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    \n\nThe Wheeler Natural Gas Processing Plant, located approximately 6.5 miles north and 0.7 miles East of Wheeler, Texas in Wheeler County, Texas, operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration compression to assist in extracting liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  Plant products include pipeline quality natural gas-primarily methane-and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The process to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Wheeler Gas Plant which contain above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\n    \n\n?    Product Surge Tank V-405 comprised, primarily, of C2+ (NGL) mixture\n\n    \n\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, there are no regulated toxic substances ab"

It is noteworthy that the Wheeler Plant follows applicable laws as set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n    \n\n    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n    \n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance in this Program Level 3 Gas Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing the C2+.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory of this tank to 80% of the maximum tank capacity.  Additionally, the tank level is limited by an electronic level device which is intended to shut down the processing plant when the tank level reaches above 80%. However, for the Worst Case Scenario calculation, the full inventory capacity (86,000 gallons) of the tank is assumed to release and ignite, as in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.56 miles or ~2,957 feet.  Additionally, although we have other controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in calculating the WCS for the Wheeler Gas Plant.  One resident, northwest of the Wheeler plant, has been identified to be within the WCS radius for this scenario.     \n\n    \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Wheeler Gas Plant is a VCE resulting from a 15,000 lbs. 60-minute release of C2+ mixture, resulting from a seal failure at the V-405 Product Surge Tank Product Pumps.  The release is expected to be isolated by an Operator or emergency responders within sixty minutes.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this event is 0.20 miles or 1,056 feet.  No public receptors are identified within the .20 mile 1-psi endpoint for this alternative case scenario.

Because the processes at the gas plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\n    \n\n    Employee Participation\n\n    \n\nWheeler Gas Plant management encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n    \n\n    Process Safety Information\n\n    \n\nThe Wheeler Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n    \n\nThe Wheeler gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\n    \n\nIn addition, the Wheeler Gas Plant maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n    \n\n    Management of Change (MOC)\n\n    \n\nThe Wheeler Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n    \n\n    Incident Investigation\n\n    \n\nThe Wheeler Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions"

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Compliance Audits\n\n    \n\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Wheeler Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are required at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\n    \n\n    CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n    \n\nThe processes at the Wheeler Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n    \n\n    Universal Prevention Activities\n\n    \n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all processes at the Wheeler Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures"

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n    \n\n    Release Detection\n\n?    Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms and shutdowns.\n\n?    High/Low alarms and shutdowns.\n\n    \n\n    Release Containment/Control\n\n?    Process relief valves that discharge to a flare header to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n?    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n?    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature, high level).\n\n?    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptable power supply for process control system).\n\n?    Atmospheric relief devices.\n\n    \n\n    Release Mitigation\n\n?    Fire extinguishers.\n\n?    Personnel trained in company emergency action procedures.\n\n?    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\n\n    \n\n    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n    \n\nThe Wheeler Gas Plant has an excellent record of accidental release prevention.  There have been no accidental releases that have occurred that have resulted in offsite effects over the past 5 years.  We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  \n\n\n\n    Number of RMP Events with Onsite Effects in the last 5 years = 0\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n    \n\nThe Wheeler Gas Plant maintains a written emergency action program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for safely responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency action response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation p"

Company personnel are also available to assess post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency action response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency action response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency action program is updated when necessary and is based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Enable Midstream Partners gas plant facilities.\n\n    \n\nThe overall emergency action program for the Wheeler Gas Plant is coordinated with the Wheeler County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, the public and industry representatives.  The Wheeler Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\n    \n\n     PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n    \n\nThe Wheeler Gas Plant resolves high priority findings from PHAs, some of which may result in modifications to the process.
