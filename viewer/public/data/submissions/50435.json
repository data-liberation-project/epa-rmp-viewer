This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority (PRASA) wich is a Government Agency.PRASA  has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for management and prevention of risks associated with the storage and use of chlorine, a regulated toxic substance, at the Los Filtros Water Filtration Plant.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112\u00ae(1).  The Prevention Program elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and State requirements.  The desinfection process at  Los Filtros Water Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Los Filtros Water Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine.  The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Los Filtros Water Filtration Plant and the immediately surrounding areas.  Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency response program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Los Filtros Water Filtration Plant supplies  water to the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water, destroying microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\nChlorine is delivered  from the Puerto Nuevo Distribution Center to the palnt in 1 ton containers by truck.  The storage building has space for 60,000 pounds of chlorine distributed in 30 containers.  Chlorine containers are connected to valves an"

From the chlorinators the dosified chlorine flows to the ejectors then the chlorine solution is applied through to different injection points (5) in the process of the plant.\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined following EPA's Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F, Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants. This guidance considers the release of the cholrine gas of an  entire container (2000 Pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the  weather conditions and a radius of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene association exposure limit wich is determine human health will be affected. Using Landwview #6 simulator and US Census 2000, it was identified that 42,400 residents are inside the 1.3 miles radius. It was used ALOHA to simulate gas dispersion.\n                                                                                                                                                                          \nAlternative case Scenario. The more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant parameters, as a release of the total content of a container, but throughtout a pipe leak. In the case the end point distance is calculated at 0.1 miles and some public receptors are identified over the most recent maps. .                                                                                       \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program                                                                                                                     \nPRASA is actually in a very agrgressive operation to implement a Prvention Plan to ensure the maintenace and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of current prevention plans.

      "SummaryText": "rent Standard Operational Procedures (SOP) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine. List of all  SOP are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPRASA has various SOPs to manage emergency associated to a chlorine release and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events. Emergency Response Program is coordinated with the State Emergency Management Agency for the public notification in case of evacuations.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nIt was certified that one accident related to a mayor release of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds has been reported during the last five years. Accident date was  03/10/2005. No death was caused but 3 operators/employee were injuried and two pesons affected in a nearby condominium.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPRASA has already implemented in the Los Filtros Filtration Plant, an alarm system and automatic valve mechanism to improve the control of the process and the safety of the chlorine handling and storage. It is recommended to replace the chlorine feeder device from a high preassure system to a low preassure system (vacuum).  Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent training in operating and maintenance procedures, and an improve preventive maintenance program.  An audit of the RMP and PSM programs will be conducted within three years to verify the effectiveness of the program."
