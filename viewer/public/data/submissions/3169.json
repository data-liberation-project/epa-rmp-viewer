Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n     The management and employees of Corn Belt FS, Inc. - Macon Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility if prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can bve stored would be 250,000 pounds, this would include the nurse tanks that would normally be there.\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n     The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n     The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.1 miles.\n     The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n      The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n4.  The accidental relrease prevention program.\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Hand"

Five year accident history\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n          - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n          - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evaccuations, shelter in place, prrperty\n            damage, or environmental damage.\n6.  The emergency response program.\n     The facility has:\n     -  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n     -  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information\n        as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n     -  a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120,\n        including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
