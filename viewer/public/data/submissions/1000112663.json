      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is intended to present a basic description of the Williamsport Municipal Water Authority (WMWA) Risk Management Program (RMP).  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (FR 61 [120], p31668) issued on June 20, 1996 and last amended in December 2021, require facilities that have a regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to develop and implement a formal Risk Management Program.\n\nThe management of the WMWA is committed to the safe handling and use of regulated hazardous substances through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance, and the training of all personnel who work with regulated hazardous substances.  Benefits of the RMP include an understanding of the hazards of regulated substances by the employees, improved process control, maintenance and equipment availability, emergency preparedness, and reduced costs related to accidents, injuries, and insurance.  The RMP provides for procedures necessary for safe plant operations.  \n\nThe WMWA Filtration Plant filters and treats the water supplies of the Greater Williamsport Area with the primary objective to provide safe drinking water to its customers.  The Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a regulated substance at the quantity kept on site, to disinfect the public water supply.  Built in response to Federal and Pennsylvania Safe Drinking Water Act regulations, the Filtration Plant addresses current and future water quality issues, including pathogen removal, taste and odor control, corrosion control, and reduction of disinfection by-products.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require each site to conduct an offsite consequence analysis which provides information about the potential consequences of an accidental chlorine release at the facility.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  The worst-case scenario is defined as the release of the largest quant"

      "SummaryText": "ity of a regulated substance in 10 minutes from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  For offsite consequence analysis, the WMWA used the American Water Works Association Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants.    \n\nWMWA employees are trained in the proper delivery, inspection, and handling of chlorine containers and also in the repair of minor incidental leaks.  The WMWA Filtration Plant is equipped with active mitigation equipment, including a scrubber that is capable of neutralizing the entire contents of a one  ton chlorine container.  In addition, the WMWA Filtration Plant is equipped with monitoring equipment which would immediately notify employees of an incident so they can take action.    \n\nEach WMWA employee receives classroom and hands-on training in safe chemical handling, preventative maintenance, and repair of minor incidental leaks.  Each employee is also trained in the procedures to be taken in the event of an accidental release.  The WMWA response program is coordinated with the Lycoming County Emergency Planning Committee.  Training drills have been coordinated with the Lycoming County Emergency Planning Committee, local fire departments, and the county's hazmat response team.  Public notification of an accidental release would be through the civil defense siren, emergency broadcasting system, WMWA website, and telephone notification of immediate neighbors by the WMWA.  The WMWA will use a contracted emergency response team to handle the repair and cleanup of any accident.  There have been no accidental releases at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe WMWA management is committed to continued review and implementation of the RMP.  The RMP regulation has helped to enhance our existing safety programs.  It also ensures that in the unlikely event of an accidental chlorine release, employees and local area emergency responders are fully trained and"
