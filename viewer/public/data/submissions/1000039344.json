      "SummaryText": "The Worthington Cylinders Kansas, LLC (Worthington) facility is located at 5605 North 119th Street; Maize, Kansas. There are three propane tanks, each with a maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons, located on site. Propane is listed as a flammable substances under the Risk Management Plan regulations found at 40 CFR 68, and is subject to those regulations. The storage quantities of propan is in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of Worthington employees as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is Worthington's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Worthington handles propane in a safe manner utilizing:\n\n  - Facility design\n\n  - Safety equipment and devices\n\n  - Safe handling procedures, and\n\n  - Personnel training\n\n\n\nIn the previous five years, there have been no propane releases that have resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  On January 19, 2009, the facility experienced an accidental release of 2 pounds of propylene.  The release resulted in one on-site injury requiring medical treatment, but did not result in on-site deaths or significant property damage.  In addition, the propylene release did not result in offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  It should be noted that the facility ceased storage of propylene.\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response and Contingency Plan has been developed for this facility.  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and evacuation of facility employees.\n\n\n\nThe facility practices a program of continued improvement for safety and environmental compliance.
