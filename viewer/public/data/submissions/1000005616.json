The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0    Description of the San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 and Regulated Substances\n\nThe San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  These substances are:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the wastewater prior to release into the receiving stream.\n* Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used to remove the chlorine from the treated wastewater before release into the receiving stream\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n \nThe RMP Rule requires The San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n* One worst-case and one alternative release s"

The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\n\n\n4.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for the San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 chlorination and sulfonation processes.  The following details the prevention program elements at the San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\nThe San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1, including the chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the covered processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\nThe San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\nThe San Jacinto River Authority Wastewater Plant 1 develops and maintai"
