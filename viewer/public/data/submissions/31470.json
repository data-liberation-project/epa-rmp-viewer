For all personnel assigned responsibility for individual requirements, this plan identifies the persons responsible and is made up of four major areas identified as the Management System, Hazard Assessment, Prevention Program, and Emergency Response Program.  Aqua Ohio is committed to safety and the implementation of all the standard safety procedures.\n\nThe Hazard Assessment is made up of the worst case analysis, alternate release analysis and a five year accident history.  This facility had no accidents in the last five (5) years.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the entire contents of a one (1) ton cylinder being released, although this would be an improbable scenario.  This scenario would have an off-site impact of 1.5 miles from the treatment plant.  One alternate release scenario, which would be a more likely scenario, would consist of a pin-hole leak in a line. This scenario would have a .10 mile release radius.  Another likely scenario would consist of   a vacuum regulator leak which would have a release radius of .20 miles.  The modeling of these scenarios was performed utilizing a Degadis System which is approved by the USEPA for RMP modeling.  There are presently containment mitigation devices in place to help reduce the effects of any releases.\n\nThe Prevention Program is the most comprehensive section of the RMP and includes Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operation Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Employee Participation Plan, Hot Work Permits and Contractor Safety.\n\nThe last section is entitled The Emergency Response Program; the purpose of the Emergency Respon"
