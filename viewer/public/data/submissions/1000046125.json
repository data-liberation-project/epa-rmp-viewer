This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Buena Park Cold Storage's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2.\t\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe facility utilizes ammonia for their refrigeration system. The system is defined as a closed loop system.  Approximately 15,094 of ammonia are contained in the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  During the down season, major maintenance issues are handled to ensure the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.3.\t\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined for each ammonia refrigeration process.

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located in the CalARP Compliance Workbook.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Buena Park Cold Storage has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results"
