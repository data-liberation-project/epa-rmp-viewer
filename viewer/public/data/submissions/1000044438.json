BARTOW FACILITY\n\n\n\nWe at Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC. are committed to operating our processes in a manner that is safe for our workers, the community, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, we have established a process safety management system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at our facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with having hazardous substances at our facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Mosaic.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.\n\n\n\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n1.A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n2.A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n3.An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule. Information further describing our risk management program is provided in this executive summary.\n\n\n\nAlthough our risk management program helps ensure that our facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program. In fact, we have a comprehensive safety program that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental"

Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs\n\nWe work daily to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to, mitigate and stop the release. We work closely with the Bartow and Polk County Fire Departments and the Polk Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.  Our safety program consists of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWe are committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  We take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These steps include (1) training programs for personnel, (2) programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes, and (3) programs to evaluate the haz"

We provide emergency response training to our personnel so that they are well prepared to handle emergency situations and execute emergency response actions.\n\n\n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCE ABOVE TQ ON SITE\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (ammonia) which is a regulated hazardous substance is handled at the Bartow fertilizer manufacturing facility.   The hazardous properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to facility personnel health as well as contractors, and to reduce the threat to the community.  At the Bartow facility, ammonia is stored in greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Ammonia is used as a raw material at the Mosaic Bartow facility.  The ammonia is stored in tanks as a liquefied gas.  The ammonia is then piped to the monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP) plants.  Liquefied or gaseous ammonia may pose a health risk if the compressors, containers, or lines transferring the ammonia develop leaks or rupture.  Ammonia is brought into the facility  via the Tampa Bay Pipeline into four storage vessels (bullets). The capacity of each bullet is 200 tons.  Administrative controls at the facility limit the quantity of ammonia stored in each bullet to 175 tons.\n\n\n\n3. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe have always believed that safety is the highest priority.  Beginning in 1992, we incorporated this belief into a prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) regulation.  For Mosaic, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are nearly identical to the PS"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements. \n\n\n\n3.1  Prevention Program\n\nOur accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\n1.Process safety information.  \n\nWe maintain a variety of technical documents, including an emergency preparedness plan, to help ensure that our employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our facility.  These documents address (a) physical properties of the hazardous substances we handle, (b) operating parameters for our equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for our equipment.  We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\n\n\n\n2.Process hazard analysis.  \n\nWe perform and periodically update process hazard analyses of our processes to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of our processes.  This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to area personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.  Each analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n\n\n3. Operating procedures.  \n\nOur operators and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and p"

Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the process, (b) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (c) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Written, oral and skill demonstration reviews are used to verify that an employee understands the training material.\n\n\n\n5.Mechanical integrity. \n\nWe maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our processes.\n\n\n\n6.Management of change. \n\nWe evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n\n\n7.

Therefore, we perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation.  This review confirms that:\n\n-Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\n-Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n\n-Employee training has been completed\n\n-For a covered process, a process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new, or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\n\n\n8.Compliance audit.  \n\nOne of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment.  We audit our process every 3 years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations.  We assemble an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\n\n9.Incident investigation. \n\nWe investigate all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n\n\n10.Employee participation.

We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our facility.  We reviewed OSHAA?s fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form and work area before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices orientation and annual refresher training.\n\n\n\n12.Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures.  The contractor is required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who will work at the facility before that worker begins work at our facility. This training is updated annually for each employee.\n\n\n\n3.2 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, special measures and safety features specific to ammonia have been implemented at Mosaic to prevent accidents or releases. The ammonia bullets on site are visually inspected monthly and tested for thickness at appropriate intervals. The valves on the ammonia bullets piping are designed and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices established by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and American Society"

All ammonia pressure relief valves are also maintained per API and ASME good engineering practices. Preventive maintenance is performed on all process equipment to ensure continuous operation without incident. Mosaic maintains an ammonia relief vent flare system that contains a self igniter and is able to be run on an alternative fuel should a natural gas failure occur. These are just some of the measures which help Mosaic safeguard the employees, public, and the environment.\n\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOur accident history demonstrates the continuous safe operation of our chemical processes over the last 5 years.  There have been two releases in the % year history, information on which can be located in section 6 of the RMP. Both events result in an employee injury. Neither of these events resulted in impacts to the public or environment.\n\n\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\n\nWe have established a written emergency response program to help ensure the safety of personnel who respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n-Informing the Bartow Fire Department, the Florida EPA/FDEP, the Polk County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the National Spill Response Center about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n\n-Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous substances\n\n-Obtaining outside assistance to control and contain accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\n\n-Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\n\n\n\nWe have trained our employees to recognize and report emergency situations.
