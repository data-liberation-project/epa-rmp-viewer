      "SummaryText": "Wayne Farms LLC - Dutch Quality House IV (DQH IV) Business Unit is a poultry processing facility that stores and uses a chemical that is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  This chemical is Anhydrous Ammonia which is used in the refrigeration system.  We currently have maximum storage capacity of 18,665 pounds of Ammonia at the Wayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Business Unit facility.\nWayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Business Unit believes the RMP chemical  that we store and handle on site has very real and potential danger.   However, it is important to keep the risks in perspective.  Wayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Busines Unit's ammonia storage and handling facilities:\n1.  are properly designed\n2.  have effective operation and maintenance procedures\n3.  employ trained operators and tecchnicians\n4.  periodically conduct safety audits, and\n5.  are constantly upgrading its processes to meet or exceed industry standards\n\nWayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Business Unit  also has taken a proactive approach towards coordinating emergency efforts with the Decatur Fire Department.  The Fire Department has a copy of our emergency response program and is well trained and prepared to respond to the potential spills and leaks that may occur at the Wayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Business Unit facility.   \n\nA facility which maintains high standards, such as Wayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Business Unit , provides less public risk than a facility that does not provide safe operations.   Wayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Business Unit complies with Federal OSHA rules and guidelines for safe handling, storage and operation of ammonia systems.  We also utilize outside ammonia system experts to periodically inspect our systems integrity,  train system operators and upgrade systems to improve safety.

      "SummaryText": "ge quantities of ammonia Wayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Business Unit maintains on site, there is a very small probability that there could be off-site consequences if a major leak occurred.  Dutch Quality House IV uses EPA's OCA Guidance for off-site consequence analysis of ammonia.\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (18,665 pounds in 10 minutes), a .8 mile radius around the Wayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Business Unit facility may have to be notified and possibly evacuated.  According to 1990 Census Data,149 people who reside in the surrounding community may have to be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.\n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nProcess piping leaks could result in 500 pounds of ammonia at 50 pounds a minute over a 10 minute period.  According to EPA's OCA guidance model, this 500 pound release of ammonia should travel less than .1 miles and may effect 3 members of the general public.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Business Unit believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform the public of the potential dangers and the actions that Wayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Busines Unit has taken to minimize these dangers.  Wayne Farms LLC - DQH IV Business unit has had a great relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Morgan County."
