Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at DanChem Technologies, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass custom chemical manufacturing.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility: Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride], Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], and Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-].  \n\n\n\nHydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] is used primarily for adjusting the pH of a portion of our wastewater effluent, and in small quantities for pH adjustment of some products.  Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is used in the production of vinyl acetate polymers and copolymers.  Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-] is used in the production of vinyl methyl ether copolymers.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] at our facility is 146,634 pounds.  Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], and Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-] are present at our facility in quantities of 85,521 pounds, and 42,000 pounds, respectively.  \n\n\n\nIn previous RMP submittals, it was reported that our facility stored two additional chemicals, methyl chloride and isobutylene [2-methylpropene], in quantities greater than the listed threshold quantities.  Changes in our production processes have resulted in the discontinued use of these chemicals and we no longer store them in quantities above their respective thr"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a release of a storage tank.  In this scenario 3,447 pounds of Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is released.  The Vinyl acetate monomer is released as a vapor cloud over a period of 10 minutes.   At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.85 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L.\n\n\n\nOne alternate release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances involves a release of Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester].  In this scenario, 3,447 pounds of Vinyl acetate is released through a rupture disk as the result of over pressurization of a reactor. The vinyl acetate is released as a vapor cloud over a period of 10 minutes.   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L of Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is 0.34 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario for Hydrochloric acid (37% solution) involves a release of potentially 4010 pounds of Hydrochloric acid from a vessel rupture.  The Hydrochloric acid is assumed to be released to form a pool and evaporated.  A release rate was calculated to be 401 lb/minute, for 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L of Hydrochloric Acid is less than 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a release of a tank truck.

In this scenario, 22,505 pounds of Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-] is released through a rupture disc as the result of over pressurization of a reactor.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability limit is less than 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDanChem Technologies, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include HAZOPs, What Ifs, and Checklists.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 12/5/2012.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpos"
