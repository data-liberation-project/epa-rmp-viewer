      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nChlorine is the major hazard and regulated substance at the Evanston Water Utility. An inadvertent release of chlorine to the atmosphere may reach public receptors surrounding the facility. Chlorine is heavier than air and seeks low areas. It appears as a greenish-yellow gas and impacts public health when inhaled above the toxic end point as defined within 40 CFR 68.22.\n\nEvanston Water Utility uses chlorine to treat raw water for public consumption. The chlorine feed system is redundant and feeds chlorine from alternate cylinders through alternate piping in the event of a leak.\n\nThe stationary source is the treatment process. Liquid chlorine naturally vaporizes into the piping system. Chlorine flows at vacuum pressure from the regulator into the chlorinator that meters and controls the flow and then flows into the ejectors. The ejectors provide motive vacuum power for the chlorinating system and mix the chlorine gas with water to form a solution.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\n\n\nFailing to control the hazard and exceeding the toxic end point, EPA requires that the facility provide an offsite hazard assessment by evaluating two release scenarios (worse case and alternate case) to determine the toxic end point.Toxic end point is based on ERPG-2 concentrations developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). The ERPG-2 is a maximum air borne concentration in which is believed that almost all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious irreversible health effects or other symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action. The AIHA has identified chlorine's toxic end point as three parts per million (3PPM) or 0.0087 mg/l.\n\n\n\nAn alternative and worst-case release scenario has been completed for the facility, and Hazard Assessment documentation can be located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the EPA RMP Binder.\n\n\n\nPrevention of Chlorine Rele"

      "SummaryText": "ase\n\n\n\nThe process is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices of the Chlorine Institute and other applicable codes and standards of water treatment facilities. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, safe handling and operating procedures that we use, and training of our personnel. Program 2 Prevention Program as described in 40 CFR part 68 is followed to accomplish these goals and will minimize the potential for an unplanned release of chlorine to the environment. In the event that a chlorine release should occur, a dry absorbent chlorine scrubber has been installed on the storage room exhaust system. This scrubber is activated by the chlorine leak alarm and designed to remove chlorine from the exhausted air to less than the toxic end point.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of chlorine at the facility within the last 5 years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nDespite the Prevention Program, incidents may still occur. An Emergency Response Program is required to minimize the duration and effects of an accidental release, thereby protecting the public health and the environment. The facility relies on community emergency responders (Evanston Fire Department) and works closely with them to ensure that they are suitably trained and drilled in emergency response for chlorine releases. Notification and evacuation procedures meet EPA's requirements (OSHA Standards) and Illinois Chemical Safety Act Requirements. "
