Los Angeles Refinery (LAR) is fully committed to a program of responsible management in all areas, including health, environment and worker and public safety. In fulfilling this commitment, management systems are in place to provide the resources and training to maintain compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, ensuring that safety is incorporated into the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Accident prevention is emphasized through strict operating procedures, safe work practices, ongoing training and administrative and operational controls. While continually striving to prevent accidental releases, should one occur, the refinery maintains a well-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team for fast response and incident mitigation and control.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe ConocoPhillips Los Angeles Refinery Wilmington Plant, located in Wilmington, California, operates a variety of processes designed to take intermediate oil products from ConocoPhillips? Carson Plant and upgrade/modify them to produce a variety of refinery products including gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel.  The refinery produces and/or uses regulated flammables including, propane, butane, hydrogen and mixtures of regulated flammable substances. In addition, the refinery uses both aqueous and anhydrous ammonia, both of which are regulated toxic substances, for pollution control. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances at the Wilmington Plant is a catastrophic failure in either of two anhydrous ammonia storage vessels located in different units, resulting in releases of ammonia gas over a 10-minute period. While the refine"

The maximum distances to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 milligrams per liter) for these WCSs would include offsite impact. Both scenarios are discussed, since the disparate relative source locations within the plant could potentially impact different offsite receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for anhydrous ammonia is a leaking relief valve, resulting in offsite impact in the immediate vicinity of the refinery.\n\nThe WCS associated with flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), resulting from the release of the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing butane. Controls to prevent and/or mitigate such a release were not considered during this evaluation, therefore; the butane is assumed to release, completely vaporize and ignite into a vapor cloud explosion. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS would include offsite impact.\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances is a VCE resulting from a release of butane from a transfer line. The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this ARS includes offsite impact in the immediate vicinity of the refinery. \n  \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe ConocoPhillips Los Angeles Refinery has a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that follows the elements found in the OSHA PSM standard to prevent incidents from occurring. The following is a summary of these elements and a description of the management system that is in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation is regarded as essential to the continuous improvement of the LAR PSM program, and hence in the prevention of accidents.

The HAZOP analysis is recognized by experts as a very comprehensive hazard evaluation technique. The typical HAZOP team includes a knowledgeable operator and engineer who systematically analyze detailed process drawings to identify potential hazards. These potential hazards are assigned a risk rank according to specified criteria. The team evaluates accident prevention and mitigation measures already in place and makes recommendations if they believe additional measures are necessary.\n\nFindings of the team are documented and reviewed by management for resolution. Hazards assigned the highest risk rank are given priority, thereby ensuring that each hazard receives the appropriate attention. All approved mitigation measures are tracked to completion. Documentation is retained as to the resolution of all PHA findings.\n\nRevalidation of PHAs are conducted at least every 5 years, or when a major process change is to be implemented, to ensure that process controls do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features. Again, documented findings are forwarded to management to ensure that critical mitigation recommendations are implemented.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nLAR has set forth detailed written procedures with step by step instructions for the various modes of process operations, including startup, normal and temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdown and normal shutdown.

Over the past 5 years, only one RMP incident has occurred. This incident was an ammonia release that occurred in February 1999. While an immediately adjacent business decided on its own to evacuate as a precaution, there were no known health impacts from this release which was a fraction of the amount modeled for release in the ammonia ARS. All incidents of any kind, including near misses, that have occurred have been carefully investigated and critiqued to prevent recurrence.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery maintains a written emergency response program which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the process and the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, the public, and post incident cleanup and decontam"
