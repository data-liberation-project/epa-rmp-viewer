If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Cass County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary covered activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizes product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This facility follows the provisions of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and our State regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.\n\nDuring periods of non operation the local law enforcement and our personnel conduct inspections at various times during the day and night.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to the emergency contact numbers posted by the storage tanks and appropriate action is taken.\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the past five-years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage..\n\n5.  Energency Response Program.  The facility has an Emergency Action  Plan.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the relesse and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n6.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety.  Safet"
