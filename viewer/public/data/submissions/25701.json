Facility Information:  The owners, management and employees of Berne Co-op Association, Ute, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of various fertilizers and agri-chemicals for sale to local farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for application as a crop production nutrient. It is stored in two (2) steel tanks of 30,000 and 18,000 gallons capacity and in 54 - 1,000 gallon steel nurse tanks. The maximum amount stored is estimated to be about 446,500 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios:  A) The Worst Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank (30,000 gallons) over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum amount released is estimated to be about 131,300 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 % capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end-point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is estimated to be about 2.6 miles. B) The Alternate Case Release Scenario, based on the five year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a 3 transfer hose. The maximum amount released is estimated to be about 26,640 pounds. the distance to the end-point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is estimated to be about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  the facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1,"

      "SummaryText": "published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and the standards of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:  The facility has:  A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenanceof safe conditions. there are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
