Ammonia which is likely to be contaminated by the non-condensable gases is introduced to the Auto-Purger. The Auto-Purger refrigerates this vapor and condenses the ammonia. The remaining vapor is bubbled through water and released to the atmosphere.\n\tAmmonia Diffusion Tank: The system is designed to contain the ammonia in the event of a massive release such as would be caused by a fire. The tank contains one (1) gallon of water for every pound of ammonia in the system. The tank also has sufficient head space for the ammonia to mix with the water and form a solution of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). The solution can be safely disposed of, pending instructions from appropriate Authority Having Jurisdiction. Pre-treatment to neutralize the solution may be required before discharge to the sewer system of the City of Modesto.\tEmergency Control Panel: the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is pre-programmed to respond to signals from the Ammonia Detection System and is capable of shutting down the system by cutting off power to the compressors, closing the King Valves (to restrict the flow of ammonia)  and operating the ventilation fans. \n\tAlarm and Detection System: In the event of a fire or an ammonia leak above the set levels, the Alarm System will notify the employees with an alarm and a voice evacuation message. The Alarm System components are on an electrically supervised circuit to maintain electrical integrity of the system.\n\nA. Infrared Ammonia Detector: Air is sampled through a chamber and the infrared light is at the correct wavelength (bandwidth) to absorb ammonia and a correlation can be made to the concentration. It triggers an alarm to alert there is ammonia in the air.\n\nEQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION (continued):\n\nB.

Operators are required to participate in Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training and become certified as a condition of employment\n\tOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility. This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel. This Plan is being updated in 2010, due to a  CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP, as required by law. Any future changes to the system necessitating update will be addressed at that time.\n\tOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled release of ammonia. The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders. This EAP also includes specifi"

This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan as per 29 CFR \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00a7 1910.38(a).\n\tThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the system and with the general safety and accidental release program at our plant.\n\tIt is the policy of this facility to devote the time, energy and capital toward maintaining prevention and response programs appropriate to the inherent dangers with the use of hazardous chemicals. \t\n\n\n\n\n3.2\tTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Stationary Source:\n\n\tThe OLAM facility is located in the agriculturally productive Central Valley in Modesto, California. The plant is situated at about 90 feet above sea level at the southern border of the city limits of Modesto along Whitmore Avenue. The historically agricultural land south of Whitmore Avenue has been developed for residential use in the City of Ceres, California. The Union Pacific Railroad tracks separate the facility on the west from light agricultural businesses and a commercial strip mall. The Post Foods facility borders the northern property line and shares the same gated entrance on Whitmore Avenue. Approximately 40 acres of agricultural land lie to the east, which is subsequently bordered by Morgan Road on the eastern border. There is a commercial development consisting of a convenience / gasoline store and small food service stores.\n\tThe OLAM facility, operated since 1958, processes vegetables into a variety of bulk dehydrated and / or frozen products. The facility operates three shifts throughout the year with some variance depending on crop variability.  Raw vegetables are trucked to the site and unloaded prior to the washing in the wet processing building. Once the vegetables have been wash"

The frozen vegetables may be re-blended for specific customers, and this involves refrigeration capability.\n\tPlant Security is provided by a guard located at the main gate entrance to the facility. The security guard provides emergency response support under the direction of the Emergency Coordinator. The entire plant is enclosed by a chain-link fence, except at the main gate, where trucks and personnel enter and exit as directed by the security guard. Electronic identification pass cards are required for vehicle entrance through the main gate to enter the plant area. Fingerprint recognition is used within the plant as a clock-in device.Process and office buildings are fire-sprinklered and connected to a centralized automated alarm system. The alarm has Voice Evacuation capability and can offer instructions pertinent to an event.\nRegulated Substance Handled:\n\n\tThe OLAM facility uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3) as a heat transfer fluid in the plant refrigeration system. The system is a hybrid one stage / two stage mechanical refrigeration system that utilizes a re-circulated liquid evaporator feed for product freezing. The closed loop system uses both liquid pumped overfeed and flooded systems. The system operates and is attended 24 hours day each day of the year by a qualified system operator.\n\tThe current capacity of the system is 658 TR, operating at a low-stage saturated suction temperature of - 40\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b0 F (8.8 psig). High stage saturated suction temperature is + 25\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b0 F (38.9 psig) with a saturated discharge temperature of + 115 \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b0F (250 psig).\n\t  \n\nThe Primary System Components include:\no\tFive (5) High Stage Compressors (HSC 1-5)\no\tOne (1) Single Stage Swing Compressor (SWC-1)\no\tThree (3) Low Stage Screw Compressors (LSC 1-3)\no\tThree (3) Evaporative Condensers (EC 1-3)\no\tTwo (2) High Stage Pressure Receivers (HPR 1-2)\no\tOne (1) Intercooler (IC 1)\no\tNine (9) Oil Separators (OS-XXX-Y)\no\tTwo (2) Suction"

      "SummaryText": "vapor mix.\n\tEvaporative Condensers: receive high pressure vapor from the main discharge header common to the high side discharge of compressors (except for low-stage compressors). The evaporative condenser rejects all the heat of the system to the atmosphere or evaporating water. The pumped liquid from the re-circulator packages enters the evaporators and part (up to 25%) of the liquid flashes to vapor. The resulting mixture of liquid / vapor will gravity flow back to the re-circulator package. \n\tSuction Accumulators: designed to reduce liquid carryover back to the compressors which can be damaging to the compressors. The vapor from the Liquid Recirculating Package enters its dedicated suction accumulator. The sizing allows for the separation of liquid and vapor. The vapor is sent to the booster (low-side) compressors which pressurize it and begin the cycle again. The gas / liquid / vapor mix flows into the high side compressors for increased pressurization and then on to the evaporators for the flash to vapor.\n\nEQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION (continued):\n\n\tEvaporators: remove heat from water or air. The heat in the water or air transfers to the liquid ammonia and causes the liquid to flash and become a low-pressure vapor.  \n\tIntercooler: receives intermediate pressure vapor from the discharge header of the compressors. As the vapor bubbles through 10 \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b0 F liquid in the Intercooler it is cooled and desuperheated. The second function of the Intercooler is to sub-cool high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers before the liquid goes to the Liquid Recirculator Packages.\n\tHigh Pressure Receivers: Receive the High Pressure Liquid from the evaporative condensers by gravity flow and store the liquid until it is needed by the Liquid Recirculator Package (via the Intercooler).\tLiquid Recirculator Packages: Utilize the ammonia pumps to pump low pressure liquid to the freezer coils.\n\tAuto-Purger: removes the non-condensable substances from the system.
