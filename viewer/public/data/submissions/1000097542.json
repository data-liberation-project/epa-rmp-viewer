It is also the policy of the Collier County Water Department to work with surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the event that a process incident occurs at the North County Regional Water Treatment Plant (NCRWTP).    The first responder to any incident at the NCRWTP is the Greater Naples Fire & Rescue (GNFR).  The GNFR works in close relation with the operations team at the NCRWTP, including training on site annually and sitting in on the annual review of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe primary activity at the NCRWTP is a municipal water treatment plant.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at plant.  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site at this facility is 23 tons.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nCollier County is in compliance with 40 CFR 68. The County has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system, as well as, administrative, technical, operating, and maintenance procedures.  In addition, all program elements have been reviewed by the County's internal safety auditors (Risk Management Department) and found to be in compliance.\n\n\n\nThe County has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release.  The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the li"

The ERP for the NCRWTP specifically is attached to the RMP document as Attachment A to Chapter 9.  The ERP is reviewed annually by the Water Department management team.  Collier County conducts regular exercises on various components of the ERP, which the Water Department actively participates in. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nAs part of the Process Hazard Review, no changes were recommended for the current review period.\n\n\n\nNCRWTP will continue the following:\n\n\n\nProvide local emergency responders with the revised RMP.\n\nOutcome:  As noted above, the Water Department has developed a close working relationship with the various Fire Department's within the Collier County Water District.  The first responder to the NCRWTP is the Greater Naples Fire & Rescue and the primary haz-mat responder is the Greater Naples Fire & Rescue.  GNFR has been provided copies of the Department's Risk Management Plans.\n\n\n\nWrite chlorine vendor to request all documentation of safety training that relates to off load and loading cylinders.\n\nOutcome:  The Plant Manager annually updates the information maintained on file at the NCRWTP to document that all drivers sent to the Plant have been appropriately trained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
