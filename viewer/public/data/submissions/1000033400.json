EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nAir Products Performance Manufacturing, Inc. (Herein called APPMC) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the APPMC Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the APPMC Plant has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the  APPMC Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the APPMC Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the APPMC Plant.\r\n\r\n1.2\t Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nAir Products Performance Manufacturing, Inc. is committed to the safety of  the  APPMC Plant workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The APPMC Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to minimize such releases. The  APPMC Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and coordinates with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), which have established a program to warn the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\r\n\r\n1.2\t The APPMC Plant and Regulated Substances\r\nThe   APPMC Plant handles  two (2) substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covere"

This process is used to feed the alkoxylation reactors at the plant to produce specialty products for targeted markets, such as household specialty products and industrial and institutional products.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the use of regulated substances at the  APPMC Plant, the following process is covered by the RMP rule:\r\n\r\nProcess\tOxide storage/Reactor area process\r\nProgram Level\t3\r\n\r\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nThe APPMC Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating both worst case scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs). The  APPMC Plant does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the APPMC Plant.  ARSs help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility developed prevention program elements basded on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.  \r\n\r\n1.5  Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo releases of oxides have occurred from the APPMC Plant in the last 5 years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage off site.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.6  Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe APPMC Plant has established a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the APPMC Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. \r\n\r\n1.7  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe APPMC Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of  the APPMC Plant processes through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  The APPMC Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which may result in modifications to the process and operating procedures."
