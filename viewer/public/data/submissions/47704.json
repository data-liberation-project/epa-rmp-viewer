(CEFS) has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The CEFS policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent forseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCEFS operates the Coalgate Refrigeration Plant in Coal County, Oklahoma.  This facility is a natural gas processing plant which uses mechanical refrigeration to remove liquids from the gas stream.  Glycol dehydration is used to remove water from the stream.  LPG is stored in a 30,000-gallon pressurized bullet tank prior to being shipped off-site in tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, Coalgate Refrigeration Plant is a Program 1 process.\n\nCoalgate Refrigeration Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nThis plant does store a regulated flammable substance in a vessel that exceeds threshold quantity; therefore, the Coalgate Refrigeration Plant is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Coalgate Refrigeration"

Emergency response activities are coordinated with local fire department as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)."
