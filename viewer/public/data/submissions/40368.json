      "SummaryText": "Dolco Packaging\nFullerton, CA\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Dolco are addressed in the Plant Emergency Response and Contingency Plan and Risk Management Plan. In brief, the policies include periodic inspection and documentation of the integrity of the difluoroethane storage and delivery system. The facility maintains a listing of emergency response numbers. This list includes the local as well as state response activities. The primary objective of the plan is to protect the health and well being of facility employees and the environment. Thus, any detected release would first result in evacuation and modification to potentially affected personnel and public receptors.\n\nThe facility is a producer of Polystyrene foamed products. In the process of extruding polystyrene foam sheet Formacel, Z2 (CAS #75-37-6) a flammable material is used as an expanding agent. In the Foam plastics extrusion process, purchased polystyrene pellets are melted in the extruder and Z2 is injected into the polystyrene. The Z2 is mixed with the styrene in the extruder and cooled. When extrudate exits the extruder die, the Z2 expands plastic into a foamed sheet. A Z2 storage tank is located at the outside northwest corner of the building. The tank contains Z2 as a liquefied gas. Tank is filled to 85% capacity. The tank is situated inside of bermed, fenced area. Valves and piping used to transfer Z2 from a tanker truck to the tank are located next to and at the tank. Difluoroethane sensors have been installed in the area of the storage tank and within the facility to warn of any releases. Any indications of a release would result in a controlled system shutdown, evacuation of the facility and notification to the local response authorities. \n\nThe distance to the flammability endpoint for a worst case and alternate case release scenario was calculated using RMP*COMP. This assessment has determined that the distance to a public receptor is within the range of t"

      "SummaryText": "he impact area. \n\nThere have been no significant accidental releases involving difluoroethane within the last five years that resulted in on or off site fatalities, major property damage or significant environmental damage.\n\nThe plan is reviewed through the use of Compliance audits (every three years), Process Hazard Analsysi (every five years)  and Maintenance Inspection forms through an outside agent familiar with Steel Tank Storage Requirements (every three years). Any suggestions or recommendations resulting from those inspections will result in a review of the various response plans. In addition, there is a facility management system that requires the facility manager to review and amend the response plans as necessary.\n\nThe major hazard associated with difluoroethane is flammability. Therefore, the storage and dispensing systems were designed to prevent leakage. All piping, regulators and other apparatus are kept tight and confirmed through the use of a compatible leak solution or leak detection instruments.\n\nSpecific employee response actions, to be taken in the event of a spill or release, require immediate notification to the facility manager. The facility manager, or his designee, will notify the regulatory and response authorities immediately. If a minor leak, spill or release, or fire occurs, the individual discovering the incident should attempt to locate and eliminate the source. This is only to be attempted when there is no risk to the individual or fellow employees, the proper safeguards are used and the person is properly trained and knowledgeable of the system. If the source is not obvious, and the situation presents an imminent danger, then that individual must initiate the emergency response notification procedures."
