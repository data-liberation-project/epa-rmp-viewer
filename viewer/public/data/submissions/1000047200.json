This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at out facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.0    Cherokee Nitrogen, LLC and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes.  Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins.  Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world, and is commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods.\n\n\n\nThe company is a supplier to the fertilizer, explosives, and commercial industries by manufacturing ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other products.   Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers.\n\n\n\nWe have four regulated substances present at our facility at or above threshold quantities.  These substances include ammonia (anhydrous), ammonia (conc. 20% or greater), chlorine, and sulfur dioxide.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent).  Aqueous ammonia is contained within the letdown, urea, and ammonium nitrate solutions processes.  Chlorine is used to treat the incoming process water prior to use by the facility.  Sulfur dioxide is used to treat the outgoing process water prior to discharge from the facility.\n\n\n\nTypically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions:  industrial grade (83 weight perce"

The industrial grade ammonium nitrate is used as a primary building block for commercial explosives and blasting agents.  Without this product, the mining of precious metals and gems, coal for power, and concrete for construction would be much less safe and much more expensive. \n\n\n\nAs this RMP will illustrate, our accidental release prevention programs and our emergency response planning efforts help us effectively manage any potential hazards posed by these regulated substances.\n\n\n\n3.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME codes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\n3.1    Process Safety Information\n\nCherokee Nitrogen maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\n3.2    Process Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analysis is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on April 9, 2014.\n\n    \n\n3.3    Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cherokee Nitrogen maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of op"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\n3.4    Training\n\nCherokee Nitrogen has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\n3.5    Mechanical Integrity\n\nCherokee Nitrogen carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\n    \n\nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\n3.6    Management of Change \n\nWritten procedures are in place at Cherokee Nitrogen to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of Management of Change procedures was performed on June 18, 2014.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\n3.7    Pre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Cherokee Nitrogen.
