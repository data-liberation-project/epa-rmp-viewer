THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n                  \n\nThe owners, management, and the employees of the Danville Cooperative Association are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.  Our employees are trained on  a three year, rotating basis.  These meetings are put on annually by the Kansas Department of Ag and KARA (Kansas Agribusiness and Retailers Assoc.).  Employees are trained on chemical properties, safe handling, and safe maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\n 2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storing of fertilizer for sale to the\n\nfarmer.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct    \n\napplication for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 135,439 pounds in our tanks (2) with the capacity one of 13,000 gallons and one of 18,000 gallons. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi trailer holding 43,000 pounds.  We also have 14 nurse tanks on site with a total capacity of 61,166 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe Worst case and Alternative release scenarios have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is a security issue and is dictated by the homeland security act.\n\n\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM \n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,K-61.1\", published by the American Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n\n\nNote:  The Kansas Department of Agriculture has not yet adopted the most re"

THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past\n\nfive years that:\n\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or other significant property damage at the facility;                    \n\n nor\n\n -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in \n\nplace property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has: \n\n-a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to \n\nknow information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\n-a written emergency action program in accordance with the\n\nOSHA standard, 29 CFR1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee\n\ntraining.\n\n\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of the safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementations at this time."
