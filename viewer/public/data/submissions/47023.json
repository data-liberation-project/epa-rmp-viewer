Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\n\n The management and the employees of the Norfolk plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Ammonia from Anhydrous Ammonia and 44.8% Nitrogen Solution at the Norfolk facility. If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel are prepared to work with the Chesapeake City LEPC and the Chesapeake Fire Department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulatory substance handled;\n\nThe primary activity at the Norfolk facility  is the manufacture of fertilizer for sale to the agriculture user (farmer).\nAnhydrous Ammonia and 44.8% Nitrogen Solution (containing 25.2% ammonia) are received, generally by Railroad Tank Cars or occasionally by tanker trucks, stored, and used from the storage tank in the manufacture of mixed-grade fertilizers for plant nutrients.\n\n3. The General Accidental release Prevention Program;\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling\nof  Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standard Institute, Inc.; The standard of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard, and recommendations of Storage and Handling of Nitrogen Solutions as supplied by vendors.  \n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History;\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases of  ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or property damage on site, or has resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response program;\n\nThis facility has:\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authori"

Planned changes to improve safety;\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the effectiveness of safety practices and the proper maintenance of the facility. There are no additional specific Anhydrous Ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
