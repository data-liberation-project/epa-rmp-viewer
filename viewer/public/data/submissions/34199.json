Cascades will work with OSHA, U.S. EPA, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) contacts, including both fire department HAZMAT and the Eau Claire Emergency Government office, to minimize the potential for any accidental release and to help assure that the mill is prepared to respond in the event of an accidental release.  The emphasis of this Risk Management Plan is on the regulated substances identified within the federal regulations.  However, Cascades Tissue has procedures in place to help minimize the chance of accidents related to other potentially hazardous substances stored or handled on site.\r\n\r\nIf an accidental release were to occur, it is the policy of Cascades Tissue to notify the appropriate emergency contacts.  The City of Eau Claire has a private company that has a HAZMAT response unit that acts as a primary responder in the event of a release of ammonia. Cascades Tissue would use their emergency response plan as a guide to direct the company?s response. The facility maintains a response plan to cover potential releases of ammonia as required by the RMP rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substance(s)\r\n\r\nCascades Tissue operates a pulp and paper mill on-site producing paper from recycled paper of various types.  Aqueous ammonia is stored on-site in excess of the threshold value of 10,000 lbs., originally included under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) listing rule.  Ammonia is used as a nitrogen source for the wastewater treatment plant.  \r\n\r\nBased on a screening review of potentially affected chemical and flammable substances within the offsite consequence Analysis (OCA) only the ammonia storage needed to be included in the RMP.  The Cascades tissues mill stores a maximum of 18,500 pounds of a"

The related modeled distance to the listed 0.14 ?g/l endpoint of concern for ammonia now extends to the near proximity of the mill.\r\n\r\nSeveral other substances were reviewed within the Offsite Consequence Analysis report as being exempt from listing within the RMP, either because stored quantities are too small to be included or because the substance stored is not a highly toxic or flammable substance listed in the RMP rules.  The mill maintains appropriate records of these other chemicals to demonstrate the exempt status and to assure that general response actions can be implemented for all chemicals of concern in the event of an accidental release.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Description\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario modeling included the following:\r\n\r\n      Substance\tScenario\t\t\tTreatment\r\n\tAmmonia\tRelease to concrete berm\tWinds at 1.5 m/s, nighttime F stability class\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenarios modeled meet the specifications described in the updated April 2004 Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance and revised 40 CFR Part 68 (the RMP rules).  Worst-case scenario modeling uses highest air temperatures and associated stored ammonia temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Description\r\n\r\nThe Alternative release scenario was selected by evaluating several more typical events and considering the resulting impact with more typical release rates and atmospheric conditions.  The Alternative release scenario was identified using the more conservative of the evaluated scenarios.  The Alternative scenarios included the following:\r\n\r\n      Substance\tScenario\t\t\t Treatment\r\n      Ammonia\tRelease to concrete berm\t Winds at 4.56 m/s, daytime D stability class\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe alternative case uses typical circumstances using 30-year average conditions for July (the warmest month) from the Eau Claire National Weather Service reporting s"

Updated population data from the 2000 census data were incorporated into the 2004 RMP renewal, to meet U.S. EPA guidance.  \r\n\r\n\r\nResults of Off-site Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis resulted in the following predicted distances to the endpoints and population potentially affected:\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDistance to Endpoint (mi.)\tResidential Population\r\n\tWorst-case Scenario\r\n\t\tAmmonia\t\t\t0.10\t\t\t\t    94\r\n\r\n\tAlternative Scenario\r\n\t\tAmmonia\t\t\t0.03\t\t\t\t      8\r\n\r\nThe estimated residential population potentially affected is derived using procedures described in EPA?s Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  These procedures conservatively include the entire area inside of a circle described using the storage vessel at the center and the distance to the endpoint as the radius.  Since typical events affect only a relatively narrow sector of this circle, and only a portion of the population would be present at the time, this estimate clearly represents an upper bound for the potentially impacted residential population.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Program and Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nCascades Tissue complies with EPA?s Accident Prevention Provisions set forth in 40 CFR Part 68 and applicable state and local codes and regulations. Related discussion on the prevention initiatives is provided with the data elements in Section 8 of this plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo reportable incidents related to ammonia storage have occurred in the past five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving regulated ammonia storage Cascades Tissue will notify the Eau Claire Fire Department HAZMAT team or the Eau Claire LEPC as appropriate.

Several changes to the ammonia storage practices were completed shortly before the 1999 RMP submittal, which were included in the June 1999 plan.
