Ammonia is used in a closed loop process to freeze finished frozen and breaded fish portions and other frozen portioned products.\n\nCommitment to Safety\n\nTrident's Anacortes facility has been accepted to participate in OSHAs' VPP program.  The program is \"designed to develop and implement a system to identify, evaluate, prevent, and control occupational hazards to prevent employee injury.\"  Acceptance in the program is granted after an extensive evaluation of the facility and its' safety programs.  OSHA has awarded our facility VPP Star ranking, the highest ranking in their program.  Improvement to facility safety is fundamental to continuing participation in the program.  Anacortes is the second facility in our company to achieve this honor.  Our company goal is for all facilities to gain acceptance into the VPP program.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed to follow established Codes and Standards when it was built.  This insures safe design of the ammonia refrigeration system and its installation.  Following existing Building, Mechanical, Fire and Electrical Codes and Standards, the refrigeration systems' engineering design, materials of construction, procedures for proper installation of equipment by trained installation contractors, and testing piping and equipment safeties was performed on the system at installation.  Automatic devices protect against critical system upsets such as high levels, high pressures, and high temperatures.  There is a maintenance program at the facility used to document the testing, inspection, and maintenance of the refrigeration system and its components.  Training is provide"
