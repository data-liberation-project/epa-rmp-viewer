This places the Steamboat Gas Plant under the RMP Level 1 requirements.\n\nSummary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented a Program 1 level Prevention Program, as required by the RMP rules.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of accidental NGL releases from the facility and include such measures as safety information, a system hazard review, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, management system, and updates.  The facility prevention program is an ongoing program based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents/releases of NGL since the plant start up on March 5, 2020.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Steamboat Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employee and public safety as well as the environment.\n\nSafety Management and Changes\n\nThe facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements. Facility management and technical personnel are responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  A company-wide Management of Change Program is in place to ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain and improve safety. Ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance, and investigations will be conducted as required by the RMP.  Updates to the RMP will be completed as necessary in response to these activities."

There are no public receptors within this distance.\n\nRMP Program Level Determination\n\nDefinitions of RMP Program Level\n\nThe RMP rule defines three different program levels based on the potential for public impacts and the efforts needed to prevent accidents [2].\nRMP Program Level 1 (Level 1): Processes which would not affect the public in the case of a worst-case release; in the language of Part 68, processes with no public receptors within the distance to an endpoint from a worst-case release. Additionally, these processes must have had no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the past five years to be eligible for Level 1, which imposes limited hazard assessment requirements and minimal prevention and emergency response requirements.\nRMP Program Level 2 (Level 2): Processes not eligible for Level 1 or subject to Level 3 are placed in Level 2, which imposes streamlined prevention program requirements, as well as additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements. \nRMP Program Level 3 (Level 3): Processes not eligible for Level 1 and either subject to Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 1910.119 under federal or state OSHA programs or classified in one of ten specified North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes are placed in Level 3, which imposes OSHA's PSM standard as the prevention program as well as additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements.\n\nSteamboat Gas Plant RMP Program Level\nThe Steamboat Gas Plant is regulated by the federal Accidental Release Prevention Program (Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations [CFR]) and falls under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule 29 CFR 1910.119.\nThe facility is not eligible for Level"

When a facility is built, and the chemicals handled are above the listed threshold quantity, the company needs to implement a risk management program, develop the RMP, and submit it to the EPA.

Based on information provided by MARPLOT, the estimated population within the worst-case' scenario is forty-two (42) people.  However, the latest satellite imagery from Google Earth, the MARPLOT Map, and onsite verification have confirmed that there are zero (0) public receptors within any worst-case scenario at the Steamboat Gas Plant.\n\nAlternate Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario for the Steamboat Gas Plant is a 10 min release of propane (1,710 lb/min) due to a loss of containment caused by a 1 hole"

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of Western Midstream that its employees, environment, property, and the public be protected from any harm that may occur as a result of its operations.  To achieve this, Western Midstream strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \nWestern Midstream implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policies of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\nFacility Description\n\nWestern Midstream owns and operates the Steamboat Gas Plant in Converse County, Wyoming. The facility is in an open area as shown in Appendix B; the business address is 68 Cherokee Trail Road Douglas, WY 82633, with coordinates 42\u00b047'36.86N, 105\u00b029'27.23W. The area is surrounded by agricultural land. The nearest major streets are Apache Trail and US Highway 26 to the south, WY-93 to the east, and Cherokee Trail to the west. \n\nCovered Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published regulations and guidance for chemical accident prevention at facilities that handle hazardous chemicals, which can be found in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule. These facilities, which handle certain hazardous chemicals, must develop a Risk Management Plan, which [1]: \n1. Identifies the potential effects of a chemical accident;\n2. Identifies steps the facility is taking to prevent an accident; and\n3. Spells out emergency response procedures should an accident occur.\n\nThe list of regulated substances under the RMP program can be found at the following link: https://www.epa.gov/rmp/list-regulated-substances-under-risk-manageme"
