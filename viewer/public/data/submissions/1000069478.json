The facility has one (1) process that is subject to 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The regulated process consists of the receipt, storage and distribution of 50% formaldehyde.  Formaldehyde is an ingredient in the phenolic resin manufacturing process.  After reaction, only trace amounts of formaldehyde remain.\n\n\n\nFormaldehyde is delivered to the facility in tank trucks and is unloaded at a tank unloading station to one of two storage tanks.  Depending on production needs, two to three trucks are delivered daily.  The unloading station is within a contained area and the storage tanks are within a common containment dike.  From the storage tanks, formaldehyde is pumped through a continuous delivery loop to the manufacturing buildings, where it is metered into reaction vessels as needed to manufacture the product.  \n\n\n\nAccidental releases are prevented through a variety of means, including review and maintenance of process safety information and employee training on standard operating procedures.  Tank levels are continuously monitored through a distributed control system (DCS), and tanks are equipped with overfill protection operated through the DCS.  The facility has a preventive maintenance program and a mechanical integrity program.  Periodic vessel and line integrity inspections are included in these programs.  Process hazard analyses are conducted in accordance with industry standard practices, on a regular schedule.  There have been no releases from the covered process during the last five years that resulted in fatalities, significant injuries, sheltering in place, environmental damage or significant property damage.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program and an emergency response team consisting of trained employees.  These employees participate in both onsite training and drills and off"
