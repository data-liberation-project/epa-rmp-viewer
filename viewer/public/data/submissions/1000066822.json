Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nChlorine Process              Chlorine                         17,500\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Chlorine is utilized to disinfect water that is served to land and residences within the District. One-ton cylinders are installed on a scale and the chlorine is injected through three Wallace and Tiernan V-notch chlorinators to a sump located beneath the chlorine room. \n\n\n\nThe Trauger Pumping Plant is remotely located and is situated behind a high-banked canal with the prevailing wind away from any populated areas. Only a few residences are located within the Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint. Although the Trauger Pumping Plant is remotely located and poses only a minimal risk to the surrounding population, administrative and engineering controls are in place to respond to a chlorine leak. These administrative and engineering controls include: \n\n- All employees involved in the chlorination process will be properly trained. Training will include leak control procedures as well as emergency measures in the event of a leak. \n\n- All employees who perform work operations around the chlorine storage areas, including but not limited to changing chlorine containers, will be equipped with and trained to use the proper protective gear including air packs. \n\n- All employees who change chlorine containers will be trained in the use of A and B patch kits for leak repair. \n\n- Employees will be instructed that if a chlorine leak is uncontrollable, then the District Emergency Response Plan is to take effect. \n\n- All chlorinating rooms, whe"

The maintenance and inspection program is carried out daily.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of chlorine in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the chlorine process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Chlorine\n\n\n\nThe chlorination process at the Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates for only a few months out of the year. The chlorination process utilizes eight (8) 1-ton containers (16,000 lbs) and ten (10) 150 lb cylinders (1,500 lbs). As with the ammonia process management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of a chlorine leak. \n\n\n\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District personnel monitor the chlorination process. In addition, the process is checked frequently during the operational season by our outside water treatment contractor. This contractor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our chlorine equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nLindsay-Strathmore"

Nevertheless, Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.
