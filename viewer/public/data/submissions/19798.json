It is the policy of Parmalat to assure, so far as possible, that every employee has a safe and healthful place in which to work.  Parmalat is dedicated to providing the resources necessary to fulfill these commitments.  It is also the policy of the company to expect each employee and contract employee to live up to the responsibility of following all safety rules and committing to safety.  Violations of safety rules are not tolerated.\n\nIt is Parmalat New Atlanta Dairies' policy to ensure adequate emergency response capabilities exist to handle an on-site emergency regarding RMP-covered chemicals.  Parmalat executes this policy through employee training, equipment purchases, and coordination with local emergency response agencies.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Parmalat New Atlanta Dairies facility is located at 777 Memorial Drive, in eastern Atlanta, Georgia.  The facility is situated just of Interstate Highway 20, in Fulton County.  Parmalat produces various dairy products at this facility.  Raw milk is delivered via tanker trucks, and is processed to make milk, chocolate milk, buttermilk, and egg nog.  Additionally, various fruit juices are manufactured at this facility.  The finished products are packaged for retail distribution.\n\nParmalat's products require constant refrigeration.  The refrigeration system uti"

      "SummaryText": "lizes anhydrous ammonia in a single-stage closed-loop system.  In general, ammonia gas is compressed by one of four compressors.  The high-pressure ammonia gas then moves on to condensers located on the roof of the production facility.  The ammonia is condensed to a liquid and is routed to the high-pressure receiver.  The receiver is located outside the compressor room.  From the receiver, the ammonia travels to the various coolers and process tanks where it is passed through an expansion valve.  The rapid expansion of the liquefied ammonia returns it to a gaseous state as it removes heat from the product/room.  The low-pressure ammonia gas then passes through an accumulator where any remaining liquid is separated out, and then back to the compressors. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is purchased for use the facility's refrigeration system.  A private company delivers ammonia to the site, as necessary, via tanker truck.  The largest quantity of ammonia is typically stored in the high-pressure receiver, located outside the facility's compressor room.  The high-pressure receiver has a maximum capacity of 13,200 pounds.  However, normal operating conditions are for the receiver to maintain a volume of 12,000 gallons.  The entire ammonia refrigeration system typically contains approximately 14,600 pounds of ammonia.  \n  \nParmalat is also covered under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Therefore, the facility is subject to Program 3 requirements as identified in the RMP.\n\nSummary of Hazards\n\nAmmonia (NH3) at normal temperatures and pressures, is a colorless gas made up of one part nitrogen and three parts hydrogen.  It is lighter than air and has a sharp, pungent odor that serves as a warning of its presence.  While ammonia is a relatively toxic substance, it is not a cumulative poison.  It is highly soluble in water and forms a solution known as ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or aqua"

      "SummaryText": " ammonia (commonly used as a household cleaner).\n\nCommercially, ammonia is made by combining free nitrogen and hydrogen gases under high pressure and temperature in the presence of a catalyst.  The process most commonly used is the Harber-Bosch method.  Industrial Grade Anhydrous Ammonia serves as the most economically abundant and efficient heat transfer medium for industrial refrigeration processes.  Its pungent odor serves as a self-alarming characteristic.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the liquid form of pure ammonia gas, technically water-free, and the substance used universally as an industrial refrigerant.  Anhydrous means without water.  Ammonia has a higher refrigerating effect, per unit of liquid volume, than any other type of commonly used refrigerant; other advantages are low initial cost and low pipe friction losses.  \n\nFor transport purposes, anhydrous ammonia is classified as a non-flammable gas by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).  The nitrogen component of the substance is inert in the combustion reaction and accounts for the limited flammability of anhydrous ammonia.  The flammable limits at atmospheric pressure are 16% to 25% (by volume) of ammonia in air.  Ammonia's high lower limit of flammability and low heat of combustion substantially reduce its combustion-explosion and fire hazards. \n\nExposure to ammonia causes intense irritation to the surface tissues of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.  Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia may blind, burn, strangle or kill.  The effect of ammonia on the skin is that of a caustic burn, varying in severity with the concentration of ammonia and the length of time exposed.  Changes in respiratory and heart action are produced as reflex actions resulting from the irritation of the respiratory tract.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the Parmalat facility is a release of 12,000 pounds of ammonia from the system's largest vessel, the high-pressure receiver, in a ten-minute peri"

With a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, and a Stability Class of F in an urban area, the endpoint was calculated to be 1.2 miles from the receiver, using the RMP*Comp(tm) modeling software.  The public receptors within a one-mile radius of the facility are schools, public parks, residential areas, and commercial buildings.  The total population of this area was estimated to be 20,367, based on U.S. Census data obtained from Landview III.  \n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternate Case release scenario for the Parmalat facility was chosen to be a rupture in a liquid line.  The specific line chosen was a one-inch diameter liquid feed line which runs from the high pressure receiver to one of the glycol chillers located on the roof of the production building.  The release duration was selected to be five (5) minutes.  The line has a normal operating pressure of approximately 150 pisg.  The piping run is approximately 150 feet in length and experiences an approximate 10-foot change in elevation from the receiver to the chiller.

A PHA on the ammonia refrigeration process was conducted on October 6 and 7, 1999.  PHAs have been and will be conducted by a team of knowledgeable individuals representing, at a minimum: operations, maintenance, engineering, and safety.

The draft operating procedures include provisions for initial startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup following a shutdown.  The draft operating procedures also address the operating limits of the covered systems, and the consequences of deviation from those operating limits.
