If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.                                                               2. Facility Information. Trotter Fertilizer is a small independant retail facility for plant food and crop protection chemicals. Crop nutrients in a clean, easily absorable form are mixed, sold and delivered. Crop protection products in sealed containers are sold and distributed to the farm.                                                                  3. The worst -case  release and alternative release scenarios.                                                                       a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a 10 minute period. The distance to the endpoint would be 4.4 miles.                                                                b.  The alternative release scenario would be the break of a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint would be .3 miles.                                                                                                                                         \n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program. This facility has implemented the provisions of OSHA  Standard  29 CFR 1910.1200 , Hazard Communication. \n5. Five-year Accident History. There have been no reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n6. Emergency Response Program.
