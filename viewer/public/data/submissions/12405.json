      "SummaryText": "The Maumee River Wastewater Treatment Plant was built in the early 1970's to serve the cities of Maumee,\nSylvania, the Village of Waterville and other portions of western Lucas County in Ohio.  It eliminated\nthousands of septic systems and numerous small treatment plants that were polluting the area rivers and\nstreams.\nThe population served by the Maumee River WWTP has grown so the plant has been improved through\nexpansion twice since it was originally built.  The last improvement was completed in 1996, it included\nadditional tankage, computerized instrumentation, and a total replacement of it's disinfection facilities.\nThe disinfection equipment consists of chlorine feeders, chlorine gas detector, and a chlorine gas\nscrubber capable of neutralizing 3000 pounds of chlorine.\nThe Maumee River WWTP formed an emergency response team three years ago, the team is trained\nand equipped to respond to a chlorine emergency at the plant.  This team meets once a month to train\nand to exchange ideas on all safety matters.\nIt is important to note that although this plan asks for a five year accident history, the Maumee River WWTP\nhas not had a chlorine emergency since it was built.  Design and construction standards plus safety\ntraining have made the use of chlorine safe in the water and wastewater industry."
