      "SummaryText": "The City of Erie Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their chlorination processes. Therefore, the facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.150. The chlorination system at the WWTP is subject to RMP Program Level 2 requirements. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP Rule requires that covered facilities prepare an Executive Summary. The following pages represent the Executive Summary, summarizing the items required as described in 40 CFR Part 68.155 (a) through (f). \n\n \n\n?68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies \n\n \n\nThe City of Erie Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has documented emergency response procedures in place, as documented in the facility's Emergency Action Plan.  This plan has been endorsed by the WWTP staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Erie WWTP. The City of Erie WWTP has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, which must be followed in the event of a chlorine leak. All personnel involved in handling chlorine are trained with regard to chlorine safety and accident prevention. \n\n \n\n?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\n \n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the City of Erie WWTP. The regulated substance handled is chlorine. \n\n \n\n?68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n \n\nThe Erie WWTP has a documented Prevention Program for the chlorination process that documents release prevention measures. These prevention measures include elements such as Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits and Incident Investigation. \n\n \n\nThe Erie WWTP is equipped with chlorine leak detection monitoring to decrease response time in the event of a chlorine leak. Also, Erie WWTP employees who are i"

Therefore, the Erie WWTP has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee safety instead of an Emergency Response Program, as allowed by 40 CFR Part 68.90(b). The Erie WWTP Emergency Action Plan outlines actions required to respond to a chlorine emergency and has coordinated this plan with the Erie Fire Department. Fire Department personnel are the designated first responders in the event of a chlorine emergency at the Erie WWTP.  Erie WWTP employees are not designated responders to a chlorine release. Coordination with the Erie Fire Department will take place according to 40 CFR Part 68.93 and Part 68.96.  \n\n \n\nAs specified in 40 CFR Part 68.90, Erie WWTP's Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR Part 68.90(b) and therefore, the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR Part 68.95. \n\n \n\n?68.155(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\n \n\nThe Hazard Review resulted in multiple proposed changes and improvements to improve the safety of the Erie Chlorine System. These changes are currently being implemented, and include improved signage and labeling of the chlorine system, PPE organization, backup power for emergency lighting, and additional emergency response drills.  \n\n \n\nIn addition to these improvements, a capital improvements project is planned for 2020 to replace some chlorination equipment near the end of its service life. The monorail used to move the chlorine cylinders into service is also planned to be replaced. This"
