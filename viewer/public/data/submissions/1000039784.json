This change in ownership requires an update to the parent companies listed in the current RMP that was submitted in March 2014.\n\n\n\nThe Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina Facility has a long standing commitment to our workers, community and the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by our establishment of management systems and resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in St. James Parish emergency drills, meetings with other companies and the St. James Parish emergency operations center, and meetings with the Ascension Parish emergency response organizations. This commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy which provides that:\n\n1) All facilities will be designed, safely operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of our employees, the community and the environment;\n\n2) All employees are educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards, and procedures to manage the hazards associated with the regulated substance; and\n\n3) Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with management systems as described in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, corporate policies include compliance with OSHA's regulation 29 CFR 119.1910 Process Safety Management standard to ensure that multiple levels of safeguards are established against the catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals from potential f"

Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies \n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC implements reasonable controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated and hazardous substances by considering less hazardous alternatives.  When using a regulated substance, equipment is designed, built, maintained and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release consistent with industry and government standards. If an accidental release does occur, Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC's emergency response policy includes trained personnel to recognize an accidental release, quickly assess the severity of the release and involve personnel who are trained to control and contain the release in a safe manner.  As mentioned above, Mosaic also participates with organizations within St. James Parish and Ascension Parish to ensure plans are in place to minimize the impact to the community and environment.  \n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source(s) and Regulated Substance(s) Handled\n\nThe Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina Facility produces granular monoammonium phosphate (GMAP), and diammonium phosphate (DAP) products. The raw materials used in this process include molten sulfur, phosphate rock, anhydrous ammonia, air and steam.  Natural gas mixtures are used as a fuel source for some equipment within the granulation facilities.  Additionally, the Faustina Facility manufactures anhydrous ammonia in the ammonia plant through a catalytic reaction involving natural gas, steam and air; the ammonia is used within the granulation facilities, stored and shipped off site.  The manufacturing process for anhydrous ammonia also includes carbon dioxide as a byproduct.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substances involved in these processes at the Faustina Facility that exceed the threshold quantities as described by the RMP rule include anhydrous ammonia and flammable gas mixture generated in the ammonia plant. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a large refrigerated stora"

Natural gas is received at the facility by an underground commercial pipeline that is connected by piping to the ammonia plant.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and flammable mixtures are regulated as highly hazardous chemicals under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Based on the quantities of these substances present at the Faustina Facility, it is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements, and therefore, the Faustina Facility satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP. The Faustina Facility has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program. A brief summary of the facility's PSM program is as follows:\n\n\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina Facility encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention and has an employee participation plan that documents the many ways employees are involved in these processes.\n\n\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina Facility has technical documents which describe the process safety information associated with the regulated substance.  These documents, which are available to all of our employees, describe (1) physical properties of the hazardous substances, (2) operating parameters for our equipment and (3) design basis and configuration of our equipment.  These documents are for reference and updated if there are changes within the facility through our management of change process. \n\n\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina Facility also has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with various processes are identified "

These revalidations occur every five years and the findings along with their resolutions are kept for the life of the process.\n\n\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina Facility has established practices and procedures to operate equipment safely through defined operating procedures which include steps for safely conducting activities, appropriate inclusion of applicable process safety information and safety and health considerations such as personnel protective equipment and actions to be taken if exposed to a hazardous substance.  Additionally, we train our workers to safely perform assigned tasks through both initial and refresher training programs.\n\n \n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina Facility has well-established mechanical integrity practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) Conducting training; (2) Developing written procedures; (3) Performing inspections and tests in accordance with recognized standards; and (4) Correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures. For example, the facility performs nondestructive testing on a scheduled basis on the anhydrous ammonia storage vessel to verify mechanical soundness from potential cracks and other sources of corrosion.\n\n\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina Facility also has procedures in place to ensure continuation of the entire PSM program, including:"

The storage vessel is monitored by operators for ammonia leaks and has continuous monitoring electronic leak detection equipment with control room alarm monitoring the annular space between the double wall for ammonia leaks. Typically, the vessel operates significantly below maximum capacity. In the event of a long-term compressor outage, the anhydrous ammonia could be flared; sent to another ammonia producer in nearby Ascension Parish; or consumed in the granulation plants. In the event of a vessel rupture, there is a dike completely surrounding the vessel sufficiently high to contain its entire contents with a margin of safety. There is also an internal dike within the main dike that would keep smaller spills from spreading out to the maximum area of the dike thus reducing spill evaporation. A series of relief valves connected to a flare also protect the tank from overpressure.\n\n\n\nOther smaller pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage vessels in the ammonia plant have relief valves that are piped directly to a flare system or vented to atmosphere. Other ammonia relief valves are placed such that a discharge is elevated and would be significantly diluted before reaching areas affecting people.
