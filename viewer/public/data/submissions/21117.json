      "SummaryText": "The Leiner Davis Gelatin facility located in Davenport, Iowa is a manufacturer of gelatin and specialized protein.  A single raw material, pig skin, is used in the process.  This facility handles ammonia which is considered toxic by the US environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain a safe storage and processing of food products, and for humidity control.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the raw materials and products being handled.  The main supply of ammonia is stored in steel tanks located at various areas within the facility.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility.\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place for many years.  The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with state codes, as available during the time of construction.  Equipment up grades have been scheduled as warranted to maintain the equipment.   This processing facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained, including using a contractor to train in basic refrigeration syst"

      "SummaryText": "em operation.  The facility program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  The facility does replace  Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.  \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Davenport Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response.  Representatives of the Davenport Fire Department visited this plant on an annual basis.  \n\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to minimize any ammonia release.  These trained staff are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past 5 years related to the ammonia system.  Furthermore, there have been no reportable releases at this facility in the past 5 years.  \n\nIn regards to the worst case release scenario for the chemicals as defined by EPA, the worst case release for ammonia from the high pressure receiver could travel off site. An alternative, more likely, release scenario could just extend beyond the property but not in all directions.\n\nIn all cases of a potential release, the extent of downwind areas affected is dependent on the amount of chemical released, weather conditions, wind speed and direction, etc.."
