The Facility treats Claremore's residential and\nindustrial waste waters before discharge to Dog Creek. The Facility uses one (1) regulated\nsubstance (chlorine) above the threshold quantity of  the Risk Management Program rule (40\nCFR 68).  Facilities that use or store any toxic or flammable substances listed in 40 CFR 68.130\nabove the specified threshold quantities in a process, are required to develop and implement a\nRisk Management Program enforced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\nThe goal of this Risk Management Program is to prevent an accidental release of chlorine that\ncould potentially cause harm to the public and/or the environment, and to mitigate the severity of\nany release that does occur. The Risk Management Program includes an analysis of the potential\noffsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention\nprogram and an emergency response program. \n\nThe Facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or\nenvironmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the chlorine system, the Facility's emergency action plan\nrequires an immediate evacuation of the Facility and immediate notification of the Claremore\nFire Department.  The Claremore Fire Department will be responsible for responding to the\nemergency and directing any required public evacuation or sheltering in place.  The Facility has\ndiscussed this Emergency Response Plan with the Claremore Fire Department and members of\nthe Claremore Fire Department have inspected the Facility.  The Claremore Fire Department has\nthe necessary equipment required to seal a leak in a chlorine ton-container.

Under this program the Facility has compiled process safety information and\nperformed a process hazard analysis, developed and implemented written operating procedures\nand trained the employees that operate or maintain the chlorine system.  The Facility has also\nimplemented maintenance and inspection procedures to ensure the mechanical integrity of the\nchlorine system's equipment.  Prior to implementing any change to the chlorine system, a\nmanagement of change procedure will be adhered to including a pre-startup review of the\nchlorine system.  The Facility will perform a compliance audit every three (3) years and will\ninvestigate all actual releases and any incident that could have resulted in a release.  The Facility\nhas involved its employees in the development of the Facility's Risk Management Program.  The\nFacility requires the use of hot work permits involving any welding or other heat  generating\nwork either on or near to the chlorine system, and has implemented procedures for training of\ncontractors and verifying contractors' qualifications.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at the Facility is approximately 10,000 pounds\ncontained in the five (5) chlorine ton-containers and associated piping, valves and other\nmiscellaneous equipment.  The chlorine equipment is housed in a building.  However, the\nton-containers are delivered by truck and are offloaded outside of the Chlorine Room.  The\nworst-case release scenario for chlorine would be an accident during offloading resulting in the\nrupture of one (1) chlorine ton-container and the release of its entire contents over a ten (10)\nminute period.

This distance is known\nas the end-point distance.  The area of potential impact is defined as a circle with its center point\nat the Facility and extending outward to the end-point distance, in this case 3.0 miles.  1990\ncensus data as calculated by the LandView  III program indicate that approximately 6,000\npeople live within this area of potential impact.  The Claremore Quadrangle U.S.Geological\nSurvey 7.5 Minute Series Topographic map (Claremore Quadrangle map), a DeLorme Street\nAtlas USA  street map (DeLorme map), and the MARPLOT  map indicate the area of potential\nimpact contains at least one school, residence, hospital, park, jail, and commercial, office, or\nindustrial area.  A review of the Claremore Quadrangle, the DeLorme map, and the MARPLOT \nmap failed to identify any sensitive environmental receptors with the area of potential impact.\n\nA more realistic release scenario known as the alternative-case release scenario was identified in\na process hazard analysis (PHA) of the Facility's chlorine system.  This release would be much\nsmaller than the worst-case release, and it was estimated that it could be contained within one (1)\nhour or less by the Claremore Fire Department.  This release could occur if an operator failed to\nproperly attach the regulator to the chlorine ton-container's valve, and  then opened  the valve. \nThis would cause a release of chlorine through the open valve at an estimated rate of 15 lb/min. \nThis would immediately cause a very high concentration of chlorine in the Chlorine Room\nrequiring the operator to immediately evacuate the Chlorine Room and implement the Facility's\nemergency action plan.
