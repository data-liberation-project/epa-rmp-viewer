The Eunice Loading Facility loads/unloads pressurized trucks and rail cars of raw feed (NGL). The Facility is capable of storing natural gasoline and raw feed in four pressurized tanks located on-site. The Facility does not store any toxic substances above threshold quantities. This Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nThe Eunice Loading Facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor for the period of five (5) years prior to September 2024. In addition, the estimated flammable endpoint for a worst-case release is less than the distance to any public or environmental receptor. Furthermore, emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the Facility and local emergency planning and response organizations. Therefore, the Eunice Loading Facility is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10.\nPer 2010 census data obtained from MARPLOT indicates that public receptor(s) are located within the worst-case release scenario from the facility. Per \u0093google earth\u0094 image as of September 2024 and EnLink operations there are no public receptors located within the worst-case release scenario from the Facility. For the purpose of this report, \u0093google earth\u0094 data is utilized.\nThe Eunice Lo"
