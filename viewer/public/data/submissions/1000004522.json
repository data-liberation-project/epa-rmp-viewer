Employees \nare also members of teams formed for compliance audits,  \nincident investigations, and pre-startup safety reviews. The \nplant emergency  response team is comprised of qualified employees\nwho receive specialized training and participate in\nemergency drills. Employees are expected to report incidents\nthat may occur, as well as any safety concerns they may\nhave.  Employee assistance is enlisted to develop training\nprograms and operating procedures and compile other critical\nprocess information. Additionally, LAR has various safety\nprograms designed to increase plant safety by encouraging\nemployee involvement.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLAR maintains key technical documents that contain information\nessential to safe operation of the various processes.

Refresher training is provided at least every\n3 years to maintain a clear understanding of current operations and any \nprocess modifications that may have occurred. Employee comprehension of \ntraining is verified, and documentation is maintained. Additionally, operating\nemployees receive required safety training annually.\n\nContractors\n\nContractors are utilized at LAR to supplement employees when increased or \nspecialized activities are conducted. Prior to final contractor selection, \nthe contract employer's safety performance and program are evaluated. LAR \nprovides contractors with a process overview, safety/hazard and safe\nwork practice information, and emergency response requirements to ensure \nappropriate knowledge to safely work at a process unit.

These PSSRs ensure that important aspects of a project, such \nas safety, procedures, personnel, and equipment, are prepared and reviewed \nbefore equipment is placed in service.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nProcedures are maintained at LAR to ensure the integrity of\nprocess equipment including pressure vessels, storage tanks,\npiping systems, relief and vent systems/devices, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Inspection and testing  \nare key components of the mechanical integrity program, with  \nelements and frequency following accepted industry good,engineering\npractices and manufacturers' recommendations, augmented by operating \nexperience. All work is documented. Deficiencies that are identified \nare corrected prior to further use of the equipment or reviewed by a \nqualified team to determine actions to be taken to ensure safe operations. \nQuality assurance measures are in place to ensure that new equipment is\nsuitable to the service for which it is intended and is properly installed.\nMaintenance materials and spare parts are also checked for compatibility \nwith the process and equipment. Employees involved in maintaining process \nequipment integrity are trained on the process, its hazards, and safe work \npractices and procedures.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nAdherence to safe work practices is deemed imperative at LAR to help ensure \nthat operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. These safe \nwork practices include: 1) a permitting system to authorize and control any\nhot  work (spark-producing) activities, 2) a confined space entry permitting \nsystem, 3) procedures to safely remove hazardous materials from equipment \nand piping"
