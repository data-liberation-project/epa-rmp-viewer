The facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facility's staff is trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using, storing, and dispensing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \n\nColusa County Farm Supply, Inc. has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the aqueous and anhydrous ammonia system.  Colusa County Farm Supply, Inc.'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\n1.2     Stationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nColusa County Farm Supply, Inc. is located at 5873 Freshwater Road, Williams, CA 95987.  The regulated substances managed at the facility are anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.  The maximum intended inventories of aqueous and anhydrous ammonia are about 536,617 gallons and 32,300 gallons, respectively. Administrative controls limit the maximum intended inventories to 85% of the maximum vessel capacity.\n\n\n\n1.3     Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: CalARP Regulations, two worst-case analyses has been modeled: One for the Anhydrous Ammonia System and one for the Aqueous Ammonia System.

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the CalARP Submittal.\n\n \n\n1.4     Risk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of aqueous and anhydrous ammonia have inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Colusa County Farm Supply, Inc. has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nThe history of the Colusa County Farm Supply, Inc. (i.e., no RMP applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Colusa County Farm Supply, Inc. Systems.\n\n\n\n1.5     Prevention Program \n\nAs part of the implementation of this Prevention Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Colusa County Farm Supply, Inc. to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe maximum intended inventories of aqueous and anhydrous ammonia are listed above.  Therefore, the anhydrous ammonia is over the 10,000 lbs threshold for EPA RMP and the OSHA PSM thre"
