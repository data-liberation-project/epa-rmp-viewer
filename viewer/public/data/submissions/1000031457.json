Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAt the Solvay Solexis Thorofare Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.\nWe are a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care Program. The ACC Responsible Care Program goes beyond the boundaries of regulatory compliance and strives for continuous improvement in industry operations and processes by incorporating health, safety, and environmental protection into all stages of a products life - design, manufacture, marketing, distribution, use, recycling, and disposal.\nThe Thorofare plant participates in the Mantua Grove Community Advisory Panel of local citizens who meet regularly with plant management to discuss various issues, especially those related to environmental, safety, and health. This mechanism was established to better understand and address the needs and concerns of the local community.\nSolvay Solexis has been proactive in communicating our risk management program with the community. A RMP Community Awareness event was held on May 1, 1999 and included participation by local industry and the local emergency response community. Everyone was invited to tour our plant and employees and management were available to answer questions. Information was distributed that explains our plant's safety programs, release scenarios, and emergency response program. This information was also put on file in the local library for reference by the community.\nThe following is taken from Solvay Solexis' Corporate Safety Policy:\nSolvay Solexis, Inc. is committed to provide a safe and healthy working environment for its employees and the employees of contra"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nSolvay Solexis has developed and currently markets a family of fluorine based products that are noted for their exceptional resistance to chemical agents and environments which attack and degrade other materials. Produced at the Thorofare, NJ facility are various grades of HYLAR? PVDF, which are used in the formulation of corrosion resistant coatings for aluminum and steel as well as long-life decorative finishes on building panels. The Thorofare plant, which became fully operational in 1985, was the world's first PVDF manufacturing facility to gain ISO 9002 certification.\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that are covered by the NJ TCPA regulations:\nToxics\n \nHydrogen Fluoride is used at Solvay Solexis as a raw material in the manufacture of Vinylidene Fluoride (VF2), which is used to produce Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF). Hydrogen fluoride is offloaded from railcars into storage tanks located in the process area.\nFlammables\nVinylidene Fluoride (VF2) is produced at our facility and is either used to produce     Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) or sold.\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility is regulated under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) which regulate the management of process safety. TCPA predates the OSHA standard and exceeds federal requirements, including annual self-auditing, submission of an Annual Report to the State, and annual inspection by the NJ Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP).\nOur management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention progra"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.\nProcess Hazard Analysis: A comprehensive program ensures that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process or process change is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. This is performed by a team which identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when deemed necessary.\nStandard Operating Procedures: Operating procedures for each area provide clear daily instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process, consistent with the process safety information. The written procedures address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, emergency shutdown procedures, and safety and health considerations.\n \nTraining:   We have established a comprehensive training program to certify operators in both unit operations and emergency response procedures. This requires operators to demonstrate (through written testing and hands-on examinations) that they have adequate knowledge before they can work independently. This training includes emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks. There is annual refresher training for all operators on the operating procedures and chemical hazards of the process.\nMechanical Integrity:   An established preventive main"

This includes testing and inspection of equipment and quality assurance checks of equipment, spare parts and maintenance materials. Any deficiencies which are found are required to be corrected before the equipment is returned to service.\nManagement of Change: A compliance program ensures that changes to equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), and operating procedures are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage the change and that existing controls have not been compromised by the modification. All changes are verified with a pre-startup safety review, all relevant process safety information is updated, and all affected employees are notified of the change.\nPre-startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is performed for all modifications which resulted in a change in the process safety information. This review ensures that all construction and equipment is in accordance with the design specifications; the safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are current and adequate; a process hazard analysis has been performed if required and that all recommendations have been addressed; and that employees have been trained on the change.\nCompliance Safety Audits: An annual audit is performed to verify that all procedures and practices developed under the process safety standard are adequate and are being followed. This is performed by an audit team of both hourly and management personnel.
