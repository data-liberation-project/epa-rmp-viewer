Beenken, General Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe management and employees of the Farmers Cooperative Society of Wesley are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Wesley Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application toward crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 289,000 pounds in four storage tanks.  1-26,000 gallon tank, 1-18,000 gallon tank, and 2-11,000 gallon tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi trailer holding 42,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 289,000 pounds, which represents the volume of storage tanks at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 7 miles. \n  \nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The quantity released would during a 2 minute duration would be 2900 pounds.   The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM)  is .3 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published "

The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\na.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n \nb.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n \nc.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n"
