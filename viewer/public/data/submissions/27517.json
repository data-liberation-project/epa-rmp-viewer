      "SummaryText": "Accident Release Prevention an Emergency Response\n\nOn January 31, 2003, Cybertech GSP purchased a closed manufacturing facility as a specialty chemical manufacturing plant.  Cybertech GSP's Taylors, South Carolina facility has implemented the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) herein described in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective of this program is to minimize the potential of a release involving a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the impact to Cybertech GSP employees, the community, and the environment.  Cybertech GSP achieves this objective through the use of good engineering practices, established operating procedures, providing appropriate training to employees, and coordinating response activities with local emergency response providers.  Cybertech GSP?s management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this program and achieve the objectives established within 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nCybertech GSP is located at 1116 Tanner Road in Taylors,  Greenville County, South Carolina.  The facility operates as a specialty chemical manufacturer under the NAICS code of 32521.  Vinyl Acetate is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantity to be subject to the RMP requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility utilizes best management practices for vinyl acetate and additional chemicals that are not subject to the RMP provisions.\n\n\nConsequence Analysis\n\nAn Offsite Consequences Analysis (OCA) investigates the potential offsite impacts of hazardous material release scenarios.  As required by 40 CFR ?68, an OCA shall include the worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario for each regulated chemical and process. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public as a result of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The endpoint distance is applied to an ar"

EPA defines public receptors as ?offsite residences, institutional, commercial, office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time??  A road does not classify as a public receptor.\n\nEPA defines the toxic endpoint for vinyl acetate as the ERPG-2 value.  The ERPG-2 value, approved by the American Industrial Hygiene Association, represents the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious effets or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.  The toxic endpoint for vinyl acetate is 75 ppm (0.26 mg/L).\n\nThe ?worst-case release scenario? for vinyl acetate is assumed to be the release of the entire contents of Tank #65 due to tank rupture (155,800 pounds) within the diked area (passive mitigation system). The evaporation rate equation for releases within a diked area, presented in Sections 3.2.3 of the OCA guidance, established the ?worst-case? emission rate for vinyl acetate as 171.9 pounds per minute, and the release duration is 906 minutes.  Since this is a steady state release, the SLAB Model was executed using a 60-minute averaging period.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for vinyl acetate was determined to be 0.80 miles using the SLAB program.  This scenario is based on an assumed wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, Class F stability, a 60 minute release, and an ambient air temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit at 70% relative humidity.  The estimated population within this 0.8-mile radius is 2,869 persons based upon 2000 Census data obtained from the Landview?5 program. Several public receptors are located within this distance, including residences in the Brookwood Forest and Fairway View communities, as well as residences located off of Tanner Road to the north of the facility.

Cybertech GSP has defined the ?alternate case? release scenario as the overfilling of Tank #65 causing 200 gallons of vinyl acetate to accumulate within the containment area.  The evaporation rate equation presented in Section 7.2.3 of the OCA guidance, established  the ?alternate-case? emission rate for vinyl acetate is 51.53 pounds per minute, and the release duration is 30 minutes.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for vinyl acetate was determined to be 0.10 miles using the SLAB program.  This scenario is based on the average wind speed of 3.1 meters/second, Class F stability, and an ambient air temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit at 70% relative humidity. \nThe estimated population within this 0.10-mile radius is 0 persons based upon 2000 Census data obtained from the Landview?5 program. No environmental receptors are located within the radius.  \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRohm and Haas Company, the former owner of the facility, reported no records of releases of vinyl acetate within the last five years from the Taylors facility that met the reportable release definition contained in the U.S. EP RMP rule.  Furthermore, no vinyl acetate releases have occurred under Cybertech GSP ownership facility that meets the reportable release definition.  \n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nCybertech GSP has developed and maintains a PSM program for the use of vinyl acetate in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.  As such, Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Taylors, South Carolina facility.\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nCybertech GSP has established emergency response and notification procedures for accidental releases of hazardous substances.
