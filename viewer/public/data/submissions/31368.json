      "SummaryText": "1.  Corporate Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe Jack M. Berry, Inc. facility is located at 3655 State Road 80 West, Alva, Florida.  Jack Berry maintains and operates an ammonia refrigeration warehouse facility and is responsible for compliance with RMP and OSHA PSM regulations.  Management has assigned responsible change to plant personnel to maintain accident prevention programs and emergency response plans appropriate to the level of quantity and use of regulated materials at the site.  Berry's use of contract expertise and qualified consultants augments onsite expertise to assure the required technical and regulatory coverage.\n\n2.  Facility Description\n\nThe Berry Labelle facility is located in the city of Alva, Florida.  The facility consists of cooler storage and frozen storage of oranges and orange products.\n\nThe Berry Labelle facility has two ammonia refrigeration systems which exceed the 10,000 lb RMP threshold quantity, Ammonia Refrigeration System 1 and Ammonia Refrigeration System 3.  System 1 contains a total ammonia quantity of approximately 23,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and System 3 contains approximately 15,720 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  No other facility system is subject to the RMP regulations.\n\n3.  Facility Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention\n\nThe facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity in ammonia refrigeration Systems 1 and 3 for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places Systems 1 and 3 in the Program 3 level.  The Berry facility uses its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Berry facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was established in 1995 for System 1 and in 1996 for System 3 by the then facility lessor, Cargill Citro-America, Inc. (Cargill Citr"

      "SummaryText": "o).  The lease has since expired and operation and management of the facility reverted back to Jack M. Berry, Inc., the owner and now operator of the facility.  The refrigeration facility is operated by the same individuals that were present during the Cargill Citro operation.  The PSM program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This preventive maintenance program ensures that the equipment remains in good operating condition and minimizes the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  As part of the PSM program, operating procedures for the refrigeration system were developed which address all phases of operation including information on maintenance and use of safety devices.  These procedures are used to train operators and mechanics who operate and work on the systems to ensure proper operation, diagnosis, and repair.  Safe work practices such as requiring Hot Work permits and Lockout/Tagout are also integral to the maintenance of the refrigeration systems.  Another essential component of the prevention program includes the collection, review, and update of equipment and system component information; the maintenance of current (up-to-date) Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs); and the systematic correction of design deficiencies once detected.  The sum of those activities ensure that the physical plant meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate up-to-date information is available when needed.  Berry staff also updated the process hazard analysis in April, 2004 on refrigeration Systems 1 and 3.  PSM procedures also include management of change, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, and incident investigation as the PSM program receives full support of Jack Berry Management.\n\n4.  Accident History\n\nThe Jack M. Berry, Inc. refrigeration systems have had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5.  Emergency Res"

      "SummaryText": "ponse Program\n\nThe Jack Berry Labelle facility has an emergency response plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The facility has internal emergency response capabilities that comply with program (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Labelle Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team and the District #9 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made by dialing 911 and by notifying the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (850) 413-9911.\n\n6.  Planned Changes\n\nSince the Jack Berry facility has experienced no accidental releases within the last 5 years, no future changes in the system safety programs are planned at this time."
