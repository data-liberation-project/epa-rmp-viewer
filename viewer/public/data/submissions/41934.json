      "SummaryText": "NVOC Wastewater Treatment Plant, located at 507 Highway 85 North, Niceville, Florida, has two independent chlorine injection systems. The chlorine storage and feed tanks are outdoors. The chlorination process is located in inside a building near the storage area.The facility has two containers on line. There is maximum storage for four more ton cylinders. The system operates under vacuum with gaseous chlorine. Ther are two vacuum regulator check units( hydro 300's). The facility continues to unload and move cylinders by a crane system. The system has two chlorine leak detectors they are Hydro GA 170's. the sensors  are  located about 12 inches from the floor. They are program to the alarm system of the facility. They alarm and have light sensor to flash. In case of an alarm the Operator on duty will notify the manager immediately. He and standby personnel will don the self contained breathing apparatus and investigate the cause. If need be they will call for outsideassistance. All operators are trained in safety dealing this area. They will shut off the Chlorine cylinders and isolate the leak if possible. If leak continues the fire Department will be called to continue extensive isolation and leak stopping methods.  The facility will continue and dual training safety dialogue with all ER entities."
