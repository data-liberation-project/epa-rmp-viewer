However, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at CWA and we often exceed standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction.\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at CWA.  Senior managementA?s commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment.\n\nFacility Description and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Red Bluff plant site covers approximately 4 acres within the Pasadena City limits. It is located at 120 North Red Bluff, Pasadena, Texas in Harris County. Our facility treats\napproximately 6 to 7 million gallons of water per day for industrial processes uses such as cooling towers and boilers.\n\nThere is a maximum of six (6) full-time employees at the plant site at any one time.\n\nWe presently handle only one chemical which is considered hazardous by the EPA. This\nsubstance is present in quantities greater than the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore is included in our risk management program.\nChlorine is used to as a water treatment chemical at the plant. It is received into the plant in one ton containers. These containers are standard DOT and Chlorine Institute specified containers. Deliveries of chlorine are received at the plant every 4 to 6 weeks.  The plant has a maximum inventory of 8,000 pounds of chlorine onsite however only"

      "SummaryText": " one container (2,000 pounds) is being used at any one time.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (worst-case & alternate-cases)\n\nThe RMP rule requirements for identification and selection of a worst-case hazard scenario are prescriptive. These requirements negate most safety systems designed to mitigate an incidental release that would typically be used in the event that an incident occurred. Based on EPA defined Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance, CWA has one worst-case hazard scenario for the toxic material handled onsite. This scenario is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an EPA defined concentration (endpoint) resulting from an accidental release.\n\nOur worst-case toxic scenario involves chlorine. Chlorine is used as a water treatment chemical at the plant. It is stored under its own vapor pressure in standard one ton containers located under a protective open-sided shed. The scenario uses the EPAA?s theoretical assumption that a container may catastrophically fail and release chlorine to the atmosphere. It completely negates any mitigation attempts and assumes that all 2,000 pounds of chlorine can be dispersed within 10 minutes to form a toxic vapor cloud that drifts offsite into the surrounding community.\n\nUsing the EPAA?s computer model RMP*Comp Version 1.07 to determine the greatest downwind\ndistance, it was determined that a chlorine vapor cloud may extend 1.30 miles from the plant.\n\nThe EPA rule also requires that alternate or more likely accident scenarios involving regulated chemicals be identified. Other more likely chlorine incidents were assessed at CWA, using parameters prescribed in the RMP regulation. The analysis of the alternate scenarios could include mitigation affects from both passive and active safety systems.\nCWA conducted an iterative assessment of several alternate or more likely scenarios. From the various scenarios assessed, CWA selected the following as a representative example of an alternative scenario:\n"

This failure assumes that 158 pounds per minute of chlorine is released. Dispersion of the chlorine gas could result in the formation of a vapor cloud extending 0.2 miles (1,056 feet) from the plant.\n\nAccidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nCoastal Water Authority originally contracted with an outside engineering firm to assist in the development of a prevention program tailored exclusively to water treatment operations, and we have collaborated with our engineer throughout every update. This prevention program has been designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects. The primary objective is to ensure complete containment of chlorine through safe operation and maintenance of the chlorination system.\n\nThe prevention program has been designed with the following objectives:\nEnhancement of the mechanical integrity of all chlorine equipment and piping,\nCompilation of safety information to improve hazard awareness, and\nTraining to increase hazard recognition\n\nFive year accident history\n\nCWA has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process. This\nprocess is defined and explained by CWA-008. Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance is experienced.\n\nFormal investigations are required to be conducted by appointed teams knowledgeable in\noperations or equipment being investigated. Root cause and corrective actions are also\nrequired in order to determine incident prevention steps. Progress regarding corrective action on all investigated incidents is required to be tracked through to completion.\n\nCoastal Water AuthorityA?s Red Bluff plant has not had an accidental release of EPA regulated chemicals within the past five years that resulted in an onsite injury or affected the community adversely.\n\nEmer"
