Processing Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Poultry processing.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Ammonia (anhydrous) and Chlorine.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for refrigeration, and chlorine is used for water treatment for wash down procedures.\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 12500.00 lbs and chlorine is 2000 lbs.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo perform the required off site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)].  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Poultry Processing.  In this scenario 12500 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 50 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 99% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the max"

      "SummaryText": "imum distance of 753 yards is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 300 ppm.\n\nThe second worst-case release scenario submitted is the release of a full cylinder of chlorine being 2000 lbs.  The liquid/gas mixture would immediately evaporate at atmospheric pressure and would evaporate over a period of 6 minutes.  At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 1.2 miles is obtained corresponding to the toxic endpoint of 10 ppm.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Processing.  The scenario involves the release of 100 lb. of Toxic liquid, and is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minute.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the amount of ammonia lost.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 300 ppm of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 458 yards.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine does not involve a significant amount of the chemical.  There is only storage in the pipe used.  The pipe is approximately 25 feet in length with a diameter of 0.375 inches giving a volume of 33.1 cu-in and would not be a significant amount to create any type of disaster according to ALOHA.  The amount released would be 0.004 lbs at a rate of 374 lbs/min and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s.  RMP Submit 2004 will not allow the actual amount of Chlorine released or duration of the event.  Therefore, the lowest amount allowed in the alternate release data included with the RMP Submit software is entered.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nGeorge's, Inc. Processing Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses are \"what if\" scenarios and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of once per year.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/30/2010.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, George's, Inc. Processing Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nGeorge's, Inc. Processing Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nGeorge's, Inc.
