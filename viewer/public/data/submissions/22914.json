      "SummaryText": "Farmers Cooperative Grain Co. is an agricultural related business which sells anhydrous ammonia to area crop producers.  The anhydrous ammonia plant consists of four tanks: 1-30,000 gal., 1-18,000 gal., and 2-11,000 gal. tanks with a toal holding capacity of 306,000 lbs. when filled to 85% capacity.\n\nThe facility is designed and maintained in accordance with all local, state, and federal rules and regulations.  Each year the employees who work with NH3 are trained at state schools in safety information, hazards, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures.  \n\nEmployees are trained on a rotational basis whereby each receives specific training once every three years.  In the last five years there has not been a release, accident, or injury of any type pertaining to the use of NH3.  \n\nThe worst case scenario would include the largest tank to  rupture and release 132,000 lbs. of NH3 with a distance to endpoint of 1.10 miles affecting approximately 1200 people.  Public receptors would include a school, many residences, hospital, public park, and the downtown business area.  Our alternate scenario would be a limited release of 11,908 pounds caused by a transfere hose failure.  The distance to endpoint would be reduced to .41 miles.  Public receptors would include schools, many residences, the public park, and the downtown buisness area.  \n\nOur emergency response plan has been discussed with the Caldwell Fire Dept. and they have agreed to be our first responder in the event of an emergency.  Many of our employees serve on the local fire department.  We believe this crosover training as both supplier and responder makes our employees exceptionally well prepared to mitigate any release scenario and minimize its impact on the community and environment.  \n\nOur facility undergoes annual inspections from the Kansas Department of Agriculture.  Our plant will  not operate without a current passing inspection.\n\n In addition, we have secured the services of a safety consultant"

We have a number of administrative controls present to prevent accidents and releases.  These include the formentioned training, requiring proper PPE (golves, goggles), having respirators available for use, making safety and bleed off water available at all times when loading, and disconnecting the power source from the tank when loading.  \n\nOur Emergency Action Plan allows only minor leaks, releases, or accidents to be handled in-house.  Any major release, accident, or scenerio requiring an SCBA will require immediate evacuation and notification of applicable local authorities.  The meeting place, administrative assignments, and emergency numbers are included in our Emergency Action Plan."
