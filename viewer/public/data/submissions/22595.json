      "SummaryText": "     10.1 Prevention and Emergency Response\n      Wm. T. Burnett & Co. is committed to the goal of preventing the occurrence of chemical spills of either hazardous or non-hazardous materials. To this end  Wm. T. Burnett & Co. has developed procedures and will take measures intended to prevent spills and also to provide an adequate emergency response in the unlikely event of a spill. To date, no accidental releases have occurred at this facility.\n     Engineered systems are installed on all bulk chemical-handling equipment. This is supplemented with job safety procedures and employee training in spill prevention and cleanup.\n     A Facility Emergency Plan is in place and specifies a Facility Emergency Coordinator assigned to interface with all Outside Emergency Responders. The Risk Management Plan, safety procedures, and the Facility Emergency Plan will be updated periodically.\n     The Emergency Response Plan for this Facility is coordinated with the (Anne Arundel County) Local Emergency Response Committee.\n\n     10.2 Description of Stationary source\n     This facility manufactures both polyether and polyester urethane foams.This is done by the reaction of a polyether or a polyester polyol with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and water. This process may occur on either of two production machines or on a laboratory scale pilot machine. All foaming machines are vented through air scrubbers.\n     This facility receives, stores and processes mixed isomers of TDI in the quantities refered to in 40 CFR 68.115. The greatest amount of TDI held in a single vessel involves receiving and  unloading railcars on a private siding. A railcar containment dike at the siding is in place to capture the contents of a single vessel spill.  After unloading, TDI is stored in several tanks located inside the facility that also have dike containment and  redundant overflow protection. The storage tanks in the facility are also exhausted through air scrubbers.\n     \n\n10.3 Worst- case Scenario\n   "

      "SummaryText": "  The worst case release analyzed for this facililty was the loss of the entire contents of a railcar fully loaded  with TDI on a siding next to the facility in a diked area constructed to receive the full contents of a railcar. TDI storage tanks inside the facility are all of a lesser storage volume than the railcar, and have containment dikes to limit the size of the potential puddle to well less then the size of a puddle from a railcar.              .\n      Based on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint  for the worst-case accidental scenario (ALOHA Modeling program) for the process discribed  in Section  10.2  is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor as defined in 40 CFR 68.30.\n     The facility is entirely fenced with a single point of entry on the southwest corner.\n\n10.4 General Prevention Plan\n     Beyond the procedures outlined herein, 40 CFR-68 requires no additional General Prevention Plan for this Program 1 Facility. \n    \n   \n\n 10.5  Five Year Accident History\n\n     There have been no accidents in the past five years that have had offsite or onsite consequences.\n\n10.6  Emergency Response\n\n     The Facility maintains a Facility Emergency Plan, that is a guideline for emergencies involving, fire, medical emergiencies, and chemical spills (hazardous and non-hazardous). This plan designates a Facility Emergency Coordinator and his responsibilities as well as that of the Emergency Responders. It contains facility evacuation procedures, spill notification policy, and specific spill containment instructions.\n     This plan as well as this facility's complete set of Material Safety Data Sheets are kept in a Knox Box, (keyed only  for the local Fire Department) that is located at the entrance gate. Members of the Fire Department (Hazmat team) conduct semi annual  inspections of the facility."
