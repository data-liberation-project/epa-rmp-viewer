Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe regulated RMP substances handled at this facilities are butane and propane.  The maximum amount of butane that can be stored at this site is 1,749,600 lb.  The maximum amount of butane that can be stored at this site is 37,980 lb. North Albany Terminal operates as a bulk liquid storage and transfer facility/terminal for hire (SIC Code #4226) to handle various liquids (RMP and non-RMP) owned by its customers.  It receives butane and propane by tank truck into bullet tanks located on site.  \n\n\n\nAfter receipt, the butane is injected as needed into gasoline tanks also located on the site of North Albany Terminal to enhance the octane (RVP) of the gasoline on behalf of the gasoline liquid owning customers that have hired North Albany Terminal to store and transfer gasoline at the site for a fee.\n\n\n\nPropone is stored at this facility to supply the energy needed for the facility air pollution control devices at the truck and marine dock loading racks.  The facility has a truck loading rack for gasoline and similar liquids.  When trucks and/or vessels are loading, vapors are released to the facility's vapor combustion unit (VCU) or marine vapor combustion unit (MVCU) so that they are burned and not released.  To ensure that it is always a flame to burn off vapors from loading, the combustor has a continuous pilot light that is supplied by propane gas from onsite propane tanks.\n\n\n\nGiven the flammable nature of butane, propane, and other liquids on site, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane and propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure at the site, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  In this regard, safety at the company's facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as ensuring safety device integri"

Furthermore, comprehensive training received by site employees upon hiring adds to the inherent safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nNorth Albany Terminal's emergency response program was developed in 1994 by an outside consulting firm and is updated every 5 years.  In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release were to occur, the company operates in compliance with NFPA Code 30 (Fire Code for tank farms) and NFPA-58 (LPG gas code) in liaison with the local Fire Department which helps to provide ensure trained emergency response personnel are knowledgeable on how to control and mitigate a release.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAs stated above, the site receives, stores, and transfers butane for blending with gasoline for RVP and octane enhancement.  Butane arrives at the site via tank truck and is stored in twelve (12) 30,0000 gallon storage tanks.  The site receives and stores propane for the loading rack VCU and dock loading rack MVCU with gasoline for RVP and octane enhancement.  Propane arrives at the site via tank truck and is stored in one (1) 1,000 gallon storage tank at the VCU and nine (9) 1,000 gallon storage tanks at the MVCU.\n\n\n\nThis site has unloading ports including hose and pipe connection points.  The transport modes being off-loaded with the assistance of a terminal operator employee as needed. Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees, carriers, and contractors and to DHS TWIC Card holders at each company facility that receives liquids by water. \n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case release and alternate release scenarios were developed using RMPComp software.

The scenario involves the release of 145,800 lb. of butane.   It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor that finds an ignition source. Assuming a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an air temperature of 77 F, the maximum distance of 0.40 miles was obtained corresponding to a flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\n\n\nAn alternative butane release scenario resulting in a Vapor Cloud Fire that involves a release six inch hole in the liquid space of a tank. In this scenario, 10,300 lb. of butane is released in 10 minutes.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include positive shutoff valves, excess flow valves, back flow check valves, and an emergency shutoff valve with mechanical, thermal, and remote capability.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of lower flammability limit is less than 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nPropane\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for propane involves a catastrophic release from propane storage resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.
