      "SummaryText": "KIK Houston, Inc. is a producer of private label liquid bleach and a major manufacturer of a wide range of consumer household cleaning products for retail outlets.  There are several chemicals stored at the facility in bulk, such as: Methanol, 29% Aqua Ammonia, Caustic, Chlorine, Detergent Slurry, and High Density Polyethylene. The finished products are typically stored in polyethylene plastic bottles and packaged in cardboard boxes for shipment to retail outlets.  These cases are palletized for ease of handling and shipment.\n\nKIK Houston, Inc. manufactures varying grades of bleach consisting of a solution of water, caustic and chlorine, following the procedures and recommendations of the widely acknowledge international bearer of chlorine safety - The Chlorine Institute.  The liquid detergents, fabric softeners, and hard surface cleaners are also manufactured under widely accepted procedures. \n\nThe only chemical meeting the threshold quantity as determined under 68.115 is chlorine.  Chlorine is received in 90-ton rail cars.  KIK Houston, Inc. has a chlorine monitoring system and an automatic shut-off system.  These systems consist of five (5) chlorine monitoring devices, four (4) automatic shut-off valves (avs), five (5) chlorine expansion chambers, and associated relays and signal lines.  The automatic valves are air activated and automaticlly close in the event of a power failure. \n\nThe monitors are made of an electrolytic cell design. Spare cells are mantained at the facility.  The monitors are located at each bleach unit, on the two rail car unloading stations, and on the chlorine line near the middle of the length from the rail cars to the bleach unit.  The chlorine monitor is co-located with one (1) of the automatic shut-off valves.  The other automatic shutoff valves are located at the bleach unit and at the rail car stations.  The five (5) chlorine expansion chambers are located on the chlorine line on either side of the automatic shut-off valves.\n\nThe moni"

      "SummaryText": "tors are set to activate the automatic shut-off valves at 0.5 parts per million (ppm) and an alarm at or above a concentration of one (1) ppm of chlorine.  Each monitor at the rail cars and at the chlorine line are designed to shut down the system.  Scenario#1: If one (1) monitor at a rail car senses chlorine at or above a concentration of 0.5 ppm, the automatic shut-off valves activate at both rail car locations and at the chlorine line.  Scenario #2: the monitor at the bleach unit activates only the automatic shut-off valve at the bleach unit.  The purpose of this arrangement is to take advantage of the expansion capacity of the rail car and the bleach unit.\n\nThe chlorine expansion chambers built into the chlorine line are also provided to allow for gas expansion in the event of an automatic shutdown.  Each chamber is seized to manage the chlorine gas contained within 125 feet of line. The devices have internal rupture discs to allow the gas into the chamber.  Spare rupture discs are mantained on site.\n\nThe chlorine line system is constructed of one (1) inch schedule 80 pipes.  Three-hundred (300) pound fittings are used at all pipe junctures.  The system operates at 110 to 120 pounds per square inch (psi).  The piping is over the designed specifications to prevent any pipe failure. The entire system is inspected weekly and quarterly preventive maintenance is performed by qualified maintenance personnel.\n\nThe chlorine delivery line is completely indoors except for a short section between the building and the unloading connection.  KIK Houston, Inc. utilizes 5 heat exchangers to mantain over the design specifications of cooling capacity on the system, exceeding Tier Two control requirements.  Automatic high temperature shut-offs are in place, in addition to reduntant sensors and alarms.  As an added safeguard,  KIK employs local pressure indicators on the chlorine tank and feed line.\n\nThe facility has written procedures for the unloading of chlorine tank cars.  The"

      "SummaryText": "employees managing the chlorine unit are specifically trained in the proper connection and disconnection protocols for rail cars.  A C-kit is on site in the event of a leaking valve, line, or leaking shipping container.  The operators are trained annually by KIK's vendor Occidental in the proper usage of the kit. \n\nThe most catastrophic event that could occur at the at the site is the rupture of a fully loaded 90-ton rail car. The most likely cause of a ruptured car would be the impact of a locomotive or another rail car.  In order to prevent this, KIK has a derailer in use at all times, except when spotting cars for delivery.  During the delivery event, an operator is present to supervise the proper exchange of rail cars.  \n\nThe most likely release event would involve the failure of an unloading line.  If this were to occur and all active and passive systems failed, KIK personnel are trained to don proper PPE and mannually shut down the system down.  The site has an audible alarm and a protocol to alert and protect the surrounding neighborhood, if such an incident was to occur."
