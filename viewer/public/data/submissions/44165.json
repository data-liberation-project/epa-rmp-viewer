The diked area also contains 6 inches of water to serve as a water blanket should a release occur. Cs2 weighs approximately 10.5 lbs per gallon and is only slightly water soluable. This water blanket will contol vapors reducing the chances of fire or explosion. There is a 15 lb nitrogen blanket on the Cs2 storage tank 24/7. The nitrogen system is equipped with a low pressure alarm. If nitrogen pressure drops below 5 PSI an audible alarm will sound alerting everyone of the potential problem. There are inventory controls in place to ensure that there are no more than 63, 000 lbs ( 6,000 Gallons ) in the tank at any time. The storage tank is also situated on load cells to assist with the inventory control. The tank truck unloading area is a concrete pad with secondary containment to contain any release. The tanker unloading area is equipped with bonding and grounding straps to eliminate static electricty. The pumping system is equipped with a remote Emergency Stop button. \n\n                                                                 TRAINING AND WRITTEN PROCEDURES\n\nThere are written p"

Then written procedures for moving Cs2 from the day tank to the reactor for processing. Employees involve with the unloading, transfering or processing of the Cs2 recieves extensive class room training on the health and physical hazards associated with Cs2. The employee also recieves training on the written procedures and emergency response before working with the Cs2. The operator then receives on the job training with a senior operator for as long as it takes to prove he/she is competent to be a reactor operator.
