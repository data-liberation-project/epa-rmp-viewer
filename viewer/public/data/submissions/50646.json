Vintage adheres to written operating procedures to protect its employees, environment, property, and the general public from any off-site impacts that could occur as a result of operations at the plant.  Vintage operates its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations, which serves to reinforce its long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at their facilities.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as personnel training, building safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  The Vintage philosophy is to implement engineering and administrative controls to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances, as well as non-regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Vintage RSF Emergency Response Plan incorporates coordination with local emergency response agencies as well as the use of employees trained to recognize and respond to the hazards of a chemical release and the use of response procedures to mitigate the release of such chemicals to the environment.  The highest priority in an emergency response is for the safety of responding emergency personnel as well as affected and non-affected company and contract personnel.  Response procedures are implemented according to what is appropriate based on a hazard assessment performed at the scene of the incident.  Vintage will always attempt to have a Joint Incident Command structure in place to assist emergency response personnel in the immediate control of any release.  Priorities for response are based on life, environment and property, in that order.\r\n\r\nManagement supports the safety of the plant by having at least a Lead Operator on site at the plant with as many as four oper"

The Plant is PSM NURF exempt, however, the use of a Management of Change procedure is in place and a Mechanical Integrity program is being developed.  \r\n\r\n1.2 Facility Description\r\nThe Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant is located at 26835 W. Pico Canyon Road, Newhall, California  91354 in Los Angeles County, approximately 45 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 5 miles west of Newhall, California.  The facility is bounded by mountainous foothills and rugged terrain.  The nearest public receptacle is residential housing approximately 5 miles to the east in the city of Newhall, Ca.  There is a dry creek bed that is approximately a mile away.  A map of the area is shown in Figure 1.  A facility site map is shown in Figure 2.\r\n\r\n1.3 Regulated Substances\r\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, and isobutane are present at the facility.  No regulated toxic substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities establish by this regulation.  The elements of the company\u00bfs accidental release prevention program are summarized below:\r\n1.4 Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant is subject to RMP requirements for a Level 1 program.  The Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant by complying with RMP standards has implemented all of the requirements of the RMP Program 1 prevention program.\r\n\r\nCompliance with RMP\u00bfs Level 1 program ensures the operating integrity of the plant processes that handle flammable materials.

To control these types of hazards, Vintage has proactively identified, evaluated and developed operating and maintenance procedures to prevent, or at least mitigate, the release of chemicals due to failures in the process or equipment.  Vintage relies on its workforce expertise, experience, judgment and training to properly implement and maintain the RMP program.  An effective RMP program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire chemical process.  The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and tested to assure their effectiveness at each level.  \r\n1.5 Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nVintage has implemented specific safety features for the prevention, detection and control of releases or regulated (and other) substances at the Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant.  The following is some of the control and detection equipment located in and around the facility to minimize the risk of an accident involving hazardous materials at Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant:\r\n* Relief and/or safety valves on vessels (One safety valve with high flow valve)\r\n* Static Grounding\r\n* Shutdown devices for equipment exceeding operating parameters\r\n* Field compressor call out alarm for pressure increase\r\n* Fire Water Tank, pump and hydrant\r\n* Fail Safe operation design \r\n1.6 Five-Year Accident History\r\nThe Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant has had no incidents with off-site impacts involving a regulated substance as defined in the regulation in the past five years.\r\n\r\n1.7 Emergency Response Program Summary\r\nVintage has written emergency response procedures to address hazards that may be encountered during response or follow-up of an emergency at the Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant.

In addition, the Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant follows procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment and alarms on a routine basis.\r\n\r\nWritten emergency response procedures are in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plans.  Training on the emergency response plan enhances the preparedness of employees to recognize and respond to any release of hazardous chemicals.  The emergency response procedures provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies including prevention, preparedness, hazard assessment, response, rescue, decontamination and follow-up procedures.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, Vintage also complies with 29 CFR 1910.39, Fire Prevention Plan. The purpose of the fire prevention plan is to inform employees of the:  1.) major fire hazards in the process area; 2.) proper handling and storage procedures for hazardous materials; 3.) potential ignition sources and their control; and 4.) type of fire protection equipment necessary to control each major hazard within the process area and surrounding areas of the plant.  The fire prevention plan includes procedures to control accumulations of flammable materials and also procedures for regular maintenance of safeguards installed on heat-producing equipment to prevent the accidental ignition of flammable materials in the process.  \r\n1.8 Planned Changes to Improve Safety \r\nCurrently, there are no changes or additions planned for improved safety."
