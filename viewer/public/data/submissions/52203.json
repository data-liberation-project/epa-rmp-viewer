      "SummaryText": "Thrifty Ice Cream, a Division of Rite Aid Corporation, is located at 34.068333 and -118.068056.  Thrifty Ice Cream has developed a risk management program to address the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785). Thrifty Ice Cream is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  Thrifty Ice Cream staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\nThrifty Ice Cream has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration Process. Thrifty Ice Cream policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  Thrifty Ice Cream is also coordinated with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Health Hazardous Materials Division serving the City of El Monte area, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThrifty Ice Cream?s primary activities encompass production of ice cream and frozen desert products.  Ammonia (anhydrous), used as a refrigerant, is the only regulated substance present at Thrifty Ice Cream.  The maximum inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) is 24,000 pounds and is contained within a single, 2 stage, refrigeration system serving the various production and process areas within the Thrifty Ice Cream, El Monte ice cream plant.\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst case analysis (OCA1) has been defined"

      "SummaryText": " for the covered process.  The release was modeled to occur from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR), which can hold the entire ammonia inventory of 24,000lbs.  A passive mitigation factor was included due to the location of the HRP, which is in a enclosed room inside of the process building.  A release rate of 58.56lbs/min was determined, over a 10 minute period.  A 0.9 mile circle of concern was determined. \nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\nScenario Description: Two alternative case release scenarios (OCA2 and OCA3) were modeled.  For OCA2: A relief valve discharge from a freezer with a capacity of 36.4lbs/min discharging over a 60 minute period was considered.  For OCA3: A valve packing leak was considered in the high pressure side of the ammonia refrigeration process, and a release rate of 33.5lbs/min was calculated and considered for a period of 60 minutes.  Both scenarios produced a circle of concern of less than 0.1 mile, reported as 0.1 mile.\nAlthough the use of anhydrous ammonia for the refrigeration process has inherent potential risks, and worst case release scenarios can potentially reach the community, Thrifty Ice Cream has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make the worst case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a release of a regulated substance:\n?    The system has alarms and interlocks\n?    The system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n?    Gas det"

The equipment modeled for the release is located in a room within the building; an appropriate, yet conservative mitigation factor was accounted for in the analysis.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Thrifty Ice Cream to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed; this includes common practices outlined by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).

This plan includes:\n?    Emergency Alarm Procedures\n?    Evacuation Procedures\n?    Safety and Health Considerations\n?    Notification Procedures\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the reports.
