      "SummaryText": "A.  Accidental Release Prevetion and Emergency Response:  Custom Apple Packers, Inc. (hereafter referred to as CAP) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of CAP to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.  CAP refrigeration personnel respond to ammonia releases at a very limited level but have none the less received the training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training applicable to ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  At CAP, anhydrous ammonia is used on site.  It is considered hazardous by the EPA and is listed on the EHS list.  The chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to our personnel and reduce the threat to the community.                                                                                                                                       B.  Facility and Regulated Substance Handled:  CAP owns and operates a combination fruit packing cold storage facility located in Wenatchee, in the county of Chelan, the state of Washington. The regulated substance used is anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7) as a refrigerant.  There are approximately 18,000 lbs in the system.  One interconnected system containes all the product.  CAP uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet the minimum threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, CAP believes in the concept set forth in the \"General Duty Clause\" of Clean Air Act.  Therefore CAP has established policies, procedures, and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for all materials for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program:  CAP's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements; 1) Initial and continued training of personnel, 2) Preventative maintenance programs as described in the PSM, 3) Use of safety equipment and procedures, 4) Use of accurate & effective written operating procedures.  The ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Piping and equipment are secured and protected; compressor (engine) room exterior doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems CAP utilizes include; 1) Suction trap hi-level float, 2) High discharge pressure shut down, 3) Low suction pressure shut down, 4) High discharge temperature shut down, 5) Oil pressure failure shut down, 6) High amperes shut down, 7) Oil filters plugged shut down, 8) 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations, 8) 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations.  Operating procedures and checklists have been prepared by CAP to be used by employees performing operational functions.  Procedures are kept in the main office.  These procedures include; 1)Pre-start up procedures, 2) Routine operations, 3) Maintenance, 4) Response to major & minor releases, 5) Emergency action plan.                                                 D.  Five-Year Accident History:  CAP has had 0 accident involving ammonia in the last five years.                                    E.  Emergency Response Program:  In addition to the operating procedures, CAP has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of our ongoing training.  CAP has had numerous meetings, A fully functional drill with the Chelan County Department of Emergency Management, the Wenatchee Fire Department, Chelan Fire District # 1, Lifeline Ambulance, Wenatch"
