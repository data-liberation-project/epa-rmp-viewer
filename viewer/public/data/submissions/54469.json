The SIC code for the operation is 2013; the NAICS code is 311612.  The facility has approximately 259 full time employees.  The facility typically operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68 as their accidental release prevention program.  The system is continuously monitored by computer based controls that alert technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility?s PSM program.  The system is visually inspected periodically for proper operation daily.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.  Safe operation of the system will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures and providing appropriate training to employees.\n\nThis facility has developed and implemented a written Emergency Action Plan as defined in \n29 CFR 1910.38 as their emergency response program.  Emergency evacuation drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel quickly and safely evacuate the plant. This facility will utilize outside agencies and/or organizations to perform emergency response measures in the event of a fire, explosion or hazardous material release.\n\nII.

The major components of the ammonia system are located in the mechanical room.  The system is a two stage refrigeration cycle.  In addition, anhydrous ammonia converted to ammonium hydroxide, is used as a processing aid in the production of beef products at the facility and is an approved antimicrobial treatment by the USDA food safety inspection service. Support operations include a maintenance shop, weld shop, parts warehouse area, and administrative offices.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is listed as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The operating capacity of each system exceeds this threshold.\n\nIII. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical ? Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility complies with the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68.  The facility?s PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/RMP management of change provisions stated in the facility?s plan.\n\nThe ammonia system is controlled and monitored 24/7 by an Operations Center from a remote location.  The system is equipped with a series of redundant fail safe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can?t "

The system is equipped with ammonia detectors that alarm and start local exhaust ventilation system when the presence of ammonia is sensed above set point levels in the engine room.  The system can be manually shutdown using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\n\nIV. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no reportable accident history in the last five years.\n\nV. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving anhydrous ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic drills.\n\nBeef Products, Inc. has notified the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility's emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  \n\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility will upgrade and update safety programs as warranted or needed"
