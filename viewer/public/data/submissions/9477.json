To ensure efficient and effective management of our operations, we have developed a risk management program.  Our risk management program manual, in its entirety, describes the specific responsibilities and activities for implementing the risk management program.\n\nThe NEWWTP stores and uses chlorine to disinfect the wastewater.  The NEWWTP maintains approximately 4,000 pounds (two 1-ton containers) of chlorine on-site for use in its chlorination process.\n\nThe NEWWTP has not had any accidental releases of chlorine since it began operation in 1986.  The NEWWTP regularly conducts safety meetings to review and reinforce the proper management of our chlorine and chlorination system.\n\nWorst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenarios were evaluated and distances to endpoints were determined, public and environmental receptors were identified, and potentially affect populations were estimated.  The NEWWTP used the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance to determine the distances to endpoints. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the catastrophic release of the entire contents of the two 1-ton containers on-site.  For this to occur, the 1-ton containers would literally have to burst and instantaneously vaporize all of the liquid chlorine.  This worst-case release scenario is extremely unlikely.  Catastrophic vessel failure is a rare event.  In the event a worst-case release occurred, the release would potentially affect residences, businesses, schools, hospitals and parks in the surrounding community.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario was selected based on past history, probability of occurrence, and the ability to impact public and environmental receptors off-site.  While the NEWWTP does not have any history of accidents, the most likely cause of chlorine l"

      "SummaryText": "eaks is container valve leaks and piping leak.  The most likely alternate release scenario for the NEWWTP involves a chlorine container valve leak.  While this is not as unlikely of a release scenario as the worst-case release scenario, the NEWWTP takes precautions to minimize the occurrence of chlorine leaks.  Container valve leaks occur as a result of faulty container valves or poorly mated connections.  The NEWWTP examines all chlorine containers upon arrival for leaking valves and has procedures in-place for repairing the valve packing, which is typically the cause of leaking vales.  Poor connections are typically a result of deteriorated gaskets, which cause the connection to improperly seat.  To minimize poor connections, every time a container connection is made, the NEWWTP uses new lead gaskets.  In the event that a container valve leaks occurs, the release would potentially affect residences and the surrounding community within 0.2 miles of the NEWWTP.  \n\nThe City of Alice believes that a comprehensive prevention program is essential to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The NEWWTP includes seven basic elements in its prevention program: a safety program, a hazard review program, written operating and maintenance procedures, a training program, incident investigation procedures, and a compliance audit program to ensure effectiveness of the risk management program.\n\nThe NEWWTP maintains complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment, which is essential to an effective RMP.  The safety program consists of written information complied for the chlorination process and up-to-date safety information, enabling the NEWWTP operators to identify and understand the potential hazards involved in the covered process. \n\nThe City of Alice believes that a thorough hazard review is key to understanding how to operate safely on a continual basis.

The chlorination process is carefully managed and consistently conducted in a safe manner.\n\nWritten operating procedures developed for the NEWWTP provide the safest and most appropriate step-by-step method for conducting safe operations.  The written operating procedures give operator clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving the chlorination process.  These operating procedures include guidance from manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors of the chlorination process equipment. \n\nIn addition, the NEWWTP has implemented a maintenance procedures program that includes written procedures and schedules for maintenance and equipment inspections and tests to ensure that maintenance operations are conducted in a safe manner and implemented to maintain the mechanical integrity of the chlorination equipment.  Preventative maintenance and inspection of equipment is critical to safe operations. \n\nThe NEWWTP's training program is in-place to ensure that its operators understand how to safely operate the chlorination equipment and to understand why safe operations are necessary.  The objective of this training is to train operators so that fewer accidents occur, equipment damage is minimized, and operational efficiency is improved.  The City of Alice believes that its training program is the key to ensuring that the rest of the Prevention Program is effective.\n\nEvery employee working with the chlorine will be adequately trained to ensure safe handling, storage, and use of the chlorine.  All personnel working at the NEWWTP receive training on the operation and maintenance procedures of the chlorination process.  Training consists of one-on-one training, on-the-job training, and classroom training.  Competency tests are used to ensure that each operator trained has understood the training and is competent to operate the process safely."

Incident investigation procedures are used to assist in understanding the obvious incident causes, as well as the underlying causes, which provides valuable information identifying and solving the problem and preventing similar incidents from occurring.\n\nThe NEWWTP has implemented a compliance audit program to periodically assess compliance with its risk management program, monitor the risk management program and respond promptly to any deviations.  The NEWWTP uses the compliance audit program to verify that the practices and procedures developed are adequate and are being followed.\n\nThe City of Alice's NEWWTP has an Emergency Action Plan to ensure that system for notifying employees, the surrounding community, and the proper response authorities of in the event of an accidental releases of hazardous chemicals in effective and in-place.  The NEWWTP operators are not trained nor equipped to respond, other than minor response, to a hazardous chemical release.  However, in the event that a release occurs that requires any response other than a minor response, which can be safely performed by the City of Alice operators, the proper emergency response crews will be contacted. \n\nThe NEWWTP has implemented a management program, which describes the management responsibilities for implementing the risk management program.  The management program was developed to ensures that the elements of the risk management plan are integrated, implemented, continuously improved, and that the responsibility for the overall program and for each RMP requirement is clearly defined.\n\nThe City of Alice's NEWWTP takes a very responsible attitude towards safety.
