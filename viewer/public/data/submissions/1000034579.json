      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe Hunterstown Power Plant Complex includes a 810 MW nominal rated combined-cycle power plant (HCCPP, 3 x 1 combined cycle unit), and a 60 MW simple cycle site, comprised of 3 CT's rated at 20 MW per CT.  The CT Site first went into operation in 1971 and includes three dual fuel (oil/natural gas) fired General Electric PG5331 combustion turbine generator units.   The combined cycle power plant  began commercial operation in 2003 and has three General Electric 7FB.04 combustion-turbine generators; three Alstom triple-pressure heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) each equipped for supplemental firing capability; and one General Electric reheat condensing steam turbine generator (350-MW nominal rating). The combined cycle gas turbines were upgraded in 2014 to the 7FB.04 model, generator output is rated at 165 MW each. \n\n \n\nThe facility is located on 89 acres of a 307-acre Brownfield Industrial site in Straban Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania, one mile southwest of Hunterstown.  The CT's and HCCPP provide electricity to the PJM network. The site and equipment are owned by NRG Wholesale Generation LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\n\n\nHunterstown's policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\na. PRIMARY ACTIVITIES: This facility is a natural gas- and oil-fired electric-power generating station.\n\n\n\nb. USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia injection system at HCCPP is designed to remove NOx from combustion gas by selective catalytic reduction (SCR).  This is accomplished by injecting an approximately 30-percent ammonia solution into the combustion gas before it is passed over a catalyst. \n\n\n\nNo other toxic or flammable materials are currently stored at the facility in qua"

      "SummaryText": "ntities above the regulatory threshold.\n\n\n\nc. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED \n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia system at HCCPP is comprised of one 30,000-gallon storage pressure vessel, pumps, and piping, instrumentation and controls.  The storage pressure vessel is in a concrete diked area for secondary containment.  \n\n\n\n\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\na. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario (WCS) assumes the entire contents of the 30,000-gallon pressure vessel are released instantaneously into the secondary containment, and the aqueous ammonia evaporates over time.  The WCS can include the effects of passive mitigation systems, and for HCCPP this is the use of secondary containment to minimize aqueous ammonia liquid spills.  The quantity released is calculated as:\n\n\n\n     30,000 gallons * 7.506 lb/gal = 225,180 lb\n\n\n\nPer EPA guidance, because the horizontal surface area of the secondary containment system (1,958 ft2) is less than that of the worst-case liquid pool (no secondary containment, one-centimeter deep pool) the rate at which the material is released is calculated as:\n\n\n\n     QR  = 1.4 ? LFA ? A\n\n\n\nwhere: QR = Release rate (pounds per minute)\n\n            1.4 = Wind speed factor\n\n            LFA = Liquid Factor Ambient\n\n            A = Diked area (square feet)\n\n\n\n     1.4 x 0.026 x 1,958 ft2  = 71.3 lb/minute\n\n\n\nTherefore the unmitigated WCS release to air duration is calculated by:\n\n\n\n     225,180 lb / 71.3 lb/minute = 3,158.2 minutes or 52.6 hours\n\n\n\nb. ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \n\n\n\nThis scenario assumes that some of the contents (1,000 gallon) of an aqueous ammonia tanker truck are spilled due to hose rupture (no secondary containment).  The quantity released in the event is calculated as:\n\n\n\n     Amount released = transfer rate x release duration\n\nWhere:\n\n     Transfer rate = 200 gpm (maximum observed transfer rate = 6000 gal/30 minutes)\n\n     Release Duration = 5 minutes (estimated maximum "

      "SummaryText": "response time for transfer pump shut-off)\n\n     Amount Released = 200 gpm x 5 minutes = 1000 gallons\n\n\n\nAnd:\n\n     1,000 gallons / 7.48 gal/ft3 = 134 ft3\n\n\n\n     1,000 gallons x 7.506 lb/gal = 7,506 lbs\n\n\n\nPer EPA guidance, the horizontal surface area of the spill is that of the worst-case liquid pool (no secondary containment, one-centimeter deep pool).  The pool area is calculated as:\n\n\n\n     134 ft3 / 0.033 = 4,061 ft2 (1-cm deep pool)\n\n\n\nThe quantity released is thus calculated as:\n\n\n\n     QR  = QS ? 1.4 ? LFA ? DF\n\n\n\nwhere: QR = Release rate (pounds per minute)\n\n       QS = Quantity released (pounds)\n\n       1.4 = Wind speed factor\n\n       LFA = Liquid Factor Ambient\n\n       DF = Density Factor\n\n\n\n     QR = 7,506 lbs. x 1.4 x 0.026 x 0.55 = 150 lb/minute\n\n\n\nTherefore the ARS release duration is:\n\n\n\n     7,506 lb / 150 lb/minute = 50.0 minutes\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the above conditions are a conservative estimate and not normal operating conditions.  The aqueous ammonia unloading transfer rate ranges from 67 gpm to 200 gpm, depending on weather conditions and operator preferences.  Additionally, standard operating procedures require the delivery operator to be present throughout the delivery.  Therefore the actual response time to transfer pump shut off should be nearly instantaneous (30 seconds to 1 minute).  In addition, the aqueous ammonia tank truck has excess flow valves which would close upon the increase in flow from a hose rupture.\n\n\n\nC. DISTANCES TO ENDPOINT \n\n\n\nThe offsite consequences of this accidental release scenario were evaluated with a screening computer dispersion model (RMP*Comp, online version).  Offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case scenario must include the following improbable weather conditions: a wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mph), \"F\" atmospheric stability class, a temperature of 77?F, and relative humidity of 50%.  The maximum calculated distance to the worst case scenario endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is 0.5 miles for t"

The endpoint represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst-case or alternative weather conditions) could pose a hazard to the public.  There are public receptors (residences) within the radius of impact for the worst-case scenario, and thus this facility is subject to RMP Program 2.\n\n\n\nMore typical meteorological parameters were used in analyzing the alternative release scenario, including a mean wind speed of 3 m/s (6.7 mph) and \"D\" atmospheric stability. The maximum calculated distances to the alternative release scenario endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is 0.3 miles. There are public receptors (residences) in the impact areas for the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia pressure vessel and handling system prevention program includes the following:\n\n - the aqueous ammonia storage pressure vessel is built to exacting standard\n\n - aqueous ammonia tank trucks will only be unloaded during daylight hours on weekdays\n\n - a comprehensive plan covering all componenets of the aqueous ammonia system with respect to operation, meaintenance, inspection, and training is in place at the facility.\n\n - internal compliance audits are conducted regularly\n\n - all incidents related to the aqueous ammonia system are investigated promptly.\n\n\n\n5.

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that an accidental release of aqueous ammonia would occur, the station has prepared a detailed written emergency response plan.
