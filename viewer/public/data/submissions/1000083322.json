As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action.\n\n\n\nThe pumped overfeed system (Room 9, Precool 5, 6, and 7) operates as follows:  high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator. From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.
