Prevention process improvements are implemented based on the HAZOP's.\r\n\r\nThe Swanson River Field is covered by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  An Oil Discharge and Contingency Plan outlines the prevention and response strategies in place at the field. The Swanson River Field is also in compliance with a federal Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan. Operators take and record visual tank levels every twelve hours to prevent the overfilling of the vessel. The propane production process is shutdown if the tank is filled to 80% of capacity.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving the propane storage system during the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nAn Emergency Action Plan is on file at Swanson River Field. Emergency response at the Swanson River Field is coordinated with the Kenai Peninsula Borough Central Emergency Services.  \r\n\r\nPublic notification of emergencies is carried out through the Kenai Peninsula Borough 911 system which includes an automatic notification telephone ring down system to alert Borough residents to emergencies which affect them.  There are no residences or public buildings that would be affected by the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety at Swanson River include considering PHA recommendations to improve the integrity of the process as well as improvements to our management of change system."
