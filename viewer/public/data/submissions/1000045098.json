In fulfilling this commitment we will provide the resources and training to maintain a safe and healthy work area as indicated by company standards, accepted business practices and compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements. We will operate our facilities and handle our products in a safe manner to prevent personal injuries, illnesses and damage to the environment and the communities in which we operate. \n\n\n\nThe accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSwanson River Field complies with NFPA 58 requirements for propane storage, and it is Hilcorp Energy policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is Hilcorp Energy policy to notify the Kenai Peninsula Borough Central Emergency Services - Sterling Station.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nSwanson River Field has a small distillation tower that separates liquid propane gas from natural gas liquids.  The liquid propane gas is pumped to a propane storage tank.  The tank is connected through a valve that remains closed unless manually opened by an operator.  Operationally, the tank is only filled to a maximum of 80% of its capacity.\n\n \n\nPropane\n\nPropane is a flammable material that is used both commercially and by individuals for a variety of uses including home heating, cooking, barbecuing, air conditioning, and to power various devices and recreational vehicles.  The propane from the Swanson River Field Plant propane storage tank is sold to propane distributors who use trucks to distribute the propane locally in Alaska.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPrevention Programs: The propane storage at Swanson River Field is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Managem"

      "SummaryText": "ent (PSM) prevention requirements.  Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) of each system are conducted using HAZOP techniques.  Prevention process improvements are implemented based on the HAZOP's.\n\n\n\nThe Swanson River Field is covered by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  An Oil Discharge and Contingency Plan outlines the prevention and response strategies in place at the field. The Swanson River Field is also in compliance with a federal Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan. Operators take and record visual tank levels every twelve hours to prevent the overfilling of the vessel. The propane production process is shutdown if the tank is filled to 80% of capacity.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving the propane storage system during the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan is on file at Swanson River Field. Emergency response at the Swanson River Field is coordinated with the Kenai Peninsula Borough Central Emergency Services.  \n\n\n\nPublic notification of emergencies is carried out through the Kenai Peninsula Borough 911 system which includes an automatic notification telephone ring down system to alert Borough residents to emergencies which affect them.  There are no residences or public buildings that would be affected by the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at Swanson River include considering PHA recommendations to improve the integrity of the process as well as improvements to our management of change system.\n\n"
