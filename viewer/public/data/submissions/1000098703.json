      "SummaryText": "Vanchlor is a manufacturer of anhydrous aluminum chloride. Prevention of accidental releases and response to any releases are essential elements of the Vanchlor safety program. These programs are implemented and supported by all employees of the organization. This site handles only one chemical covered under the RMP rule, chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5). Many engineering and administrative controls are in place to minimize the potential for an accidental release of chlorine and reduce the impact of those releases. Specifics of those programs are available upon request but are not listed here for security reasons. The accidental release prevention program and chlorine specific program are in place at the facility. These programs include security, preventative maintenance, following industry standards for design of piping systems and equipment. The 5 year accident history includes no RMP reportable releases in the last 5 years. The emergency response program is in place at the facility and includes integration of the plan with the local emergency planning committee and the local fire department. To improve the safety of the facility  secondary containment including enclosure of the tanks within a building was previously constructed for the chlorine storage tanks."
