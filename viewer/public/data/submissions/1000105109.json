Hazards identified through the PHA are mitigated through improvements to process safety information, contractor management practices, employee participation, management of change procedures, and operations training. Should an accidental release of isobutane occur, actions are taken to mitigate the release through the site\u0092s emergency response plan (ERP). Incident investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the accidental release as well as any corrective actions that would prevent the release from reoccurring. Lessons learned from incident investigations are incorporated into PHA to ensure prevention steps are evaluated, and additional safeguards are put in place to prevent recurrence as necessary. The prevention program is internally audited to confirm implementation of RMP and PSM, as well as to identify areas for improvement.  \n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\nPregis Innovative Packaging, Inc. maintains a written emergency response plan for the safety of our employees during accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation process, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Pregis Innovative Packaging, Inc. employees do not respond to emergencies. Emergency notification equipment is regularly inspected and serviced to ensure proper functioning. Upon modification of the covered process, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes within the covered process that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nPregis Innovative Packaging, Inc. has exemplary occupational safety and health programs which encompass employee involvement, recognition for safe work and continuous hazard identification activities.

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Pregis Innovative Packaging, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The facility is a non-responding source, meaning it relies on local emergency responders in the event of an accidental release. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Region 5 Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) Inland South and the Visalia Fire Department to provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled \nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of foam products that are used as packaging material. We have one regulated substance present at our facility, isobutane. This regulated substance is used as a blowing agent in the foam extrusion process.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. The foam extrusion process at our facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  As part of the accidental release prevention program, hazards of the process are identified through process hazard analyses (PHA) using hazard and operability studies (HAZOP) or what-if methodologies based on detailed process safety information. The process safety information forms the foundation of other preve"
