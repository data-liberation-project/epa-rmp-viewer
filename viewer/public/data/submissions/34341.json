There are 2 covered processes at this facility which involve anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1. Ammonia Storage and Unloading. This process is comprised of the facilities required to receive ammonia into the facility and to store the ammonia for processing to manufacture nitric acid and ammonium nitrate. Ammonia may be received into the facility by either barge or by "

      "SummaryText": "rail car. Low temperature anhydrous ammonia is transported by barge and is unloaded into a low temperature storage tank. The low temperature storage tank has an administrative fill limit of 90% and a dike for passive mitigation. High pressure ammonia is received by tank cars and unloaded into three high pressure storage tanks. An administrative fill limit of 80% exists for the high pressure storage tanks.\n\n2.Ammonia Oxidation Process. Ammonia is process from storage in the ammonia oxidation process to produce nitric acid. Nitric acid is further reacted with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate solution. \n\nThe accidental release prevention program is integrated into the Donora Plant's Process Safety Management Program and the Emergency Response Plan. Employees are annually trained in basic ammonia emergency response procedures.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases or accidents in the previous 5 years of operation.\n\nThe emergency response program includes a written Emergency Response Plan, employee training programs, off site emergency response, public and private communication procedures, and scheduled emergency response drills. The emergency response program undergoes a continuous improvement process, and is subject to annual internal auditing.\n\nEach year the Donora Plant conducts a comprehensive audit of the entire safety program. The safety program is modeled after the Det Norske Veritas International Safety Rating System. The audit identifies problem areas within the system, which serves as the basis for improving safety at the Donora Plant."
