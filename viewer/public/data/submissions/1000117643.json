San Pablo Bay borders the facility to the west.\n\nInterstate Highway 80 and San Pablo Avenue run north-south through the RREC property. The property is zoned as heavy industrial. Land uses to the northeast of the facility are a combination of industrial and open space. To the east is primarily open space, and a combination of residential, light commercial, and light industrial uses are found to the south and southwest. The nearest sensitive receptor is a day-care facility in the Bayo Vista residential area, near the southern property boundary, south of the undeveloped buffer zone.\n\nThe facility\u0092s principal activity consists of renewable fuels manufacturing processes. Support units produce other industrial fuels and sulfur. RREC processes approximately 50,000 barrels per day (BPD) (one barrel equals 42 gallons) of renewable feedstocks (e.g., soybean oil, tallow, distiller\u0092s corn oil, canola oil, used cooking oil) into renewable fuel products.

The facility generates its own steam, fuel gas, and electricity, and purchases other resources, such as natural gas and water.\n\nThe facility accomplishes the production of these products from renewable feedstocks through the use of many complex processing units. Since converting to the RREC, many of the former refinery\u0092s process units  have ceased operation. The following discussion describes the RREC\u0092s existing processes.\n\nRenewable feedstocks are first sent to pretreatment units to remove impurities before processing. Two pretreatment trains are used to decontaminate and condition the feed prior to hydro-processing. A standard degumming and bleaching process configuration utilized in the renewables industry is used for each train, with the addition of a polyethylene removal section in one train, specifically for tallow feed. A fats, oils, and greases recovery unit that consists of tanks, vessels, centrifuges, and evaporators is used to remove organic material from process wastewater before treatment at the existing facility wastewater treatment plant.\n\nRREC modified both Hydrotreater Units to make them capable of processing treated renewable feed. These units treat the hydrocarbon molecules by breaking them into smaller molecules in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst. Unsaturated compounds are saturated during this hydrotreating process in addition to breaking larger chain or ringed hydrocarbons into smaller compounds. The hydrotreater process creates small hydrocarbons as well as the larger factions described above. The renewable butanes produced by the hydrotreating process are used in the facility as fuel and as feed for the RREC Hydrogen Plant.\n\nThe diesel hydrotreating unit removes nitrogen from the feedstock and sulfur from the chemical agent used to sulfide the catalyst, creating ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are processed elsew"

The smallest molecules (one, two, and three carbons) are sent to the Fuel Gas Center for subsequent use in the facility as fuel. Renewable butanes are produced for own use within the facility.\n\nThe facility has a Steam Power Plant that produces electricity as well as high pressure, high temperature steam, which is used for both heating and cooling various processes. The Steam Power Plant\u0092s demineralizer produces high quality water for use in the plant and process cooling systems. The Waste Water Treatment Plant is the facility\u0092s waste water treatment system. The water that is removed from feedstock prior to processing and water from other process stages, including stripped sour water, is treated by biological systems and carbon filtration prior to its permitted discharge.\n\nThe sulfur and nitrogen removed from processing streams is sent to the Sulfur Complex consisting of two units. Unit 237 is a new unit for the RREC. The first unit was modified to process acid gas streams from the facility amine regenerators. The second unit is new for the RREC and is used to destroy ammonia while minimizing formation of nitrogen oxides. The Sulfur Complex converts the sulfur in the streams (as hydrogen sulfide) into elemental sulfur. The elemental sulfur is sold to agricultural markets.\n\nBlending and Shipping is a separate gasoline blending train that includes tankage for gasoline blend-stocks and blending  as well as storage of the finished gasoline. This process also includes one pressurized storage vessel that stores renewable butane produced by the hydrotreaters for use in the facility as fuel and as feed for the Hydrogen Plant Unit 110.\n\nDescription of Regulated Substances\n\nMany of the substances handled at the facility regulated by the RMP program are flammables.

Materials with low flash points must be handled carefully and isolated from ignition sources to prevent fires or explosions. Regulated flammables are primarily gases at normal pressure and temperature or materials that vaporize very quickly.\n\nAs part of processing renewable feedstock to produce renewable fuels, some regulated toxic substances are generated in addition to the flammables. Hydrogen sulfide and aqueous ammonia are present at the facility at quantities exceeding their state regulatory limits; however, only aqueous ammonia exceeds the federal RMP regulatory limits. Hydrogen sulfide and ammonia are hazardous principally through inhalation.\n\nHydrogen sulfide (H2S), with its characteristic rotten egg odor, is created in the processing units that remove sulfur and nitrogen from the process streams. In addition, some hydrogen sulfide is generated from the catalyst sulfiding agent used in certain processes. It is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas and its odor can be readily detected at concentrations below concern. Hydrogen sulfide is not stored at the facility. As soon as it is generated, it is immediately sent to the Sulfur Complex for processing. In addition, minor amounts of hydrogen sulfide may evolve from spills of sour water.\n\nAmmonia is also created and treated by the same processing units. Ammonia is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas with a sharp irritating odor. Its odor is also readily detectable at concentrations below concern. The facility uses aqueous ammonia to regenerate or prepare new catalyst and for nitrogen oxide emission control. \n\nThere are several other regulated substances present at the facility at quantities below their regulatory thresholds, and thus not subject to RMP requirements.\n\nNo other substances at the facility are included in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 40, Part"

These safeguards were either originally constructed in the unit or implemented as a recommendation from a PHA, audit, or other avenue. These safeguards are examined during a PHA for their adequacy in detecting, preventing and/or mitigating potential hazards of the process. If the PHA team determines that the safeguards do not adequately protect against a particular hazard, corrective actions are recommended.\n\nAs part of the PHA study, potential hazards and their safeguards are examined in a rigorous, methodical fashion for a variety of scenarios. The primary focus is on prevention of release. The following are examples of safeguards designed for prevention of the identified potential hazard:\n\u00bf Excessive pressure: high pressure alarms, pressure relief valves, thermal relief valves, piping/flange/equipment pressure ratings, water separation facilities, and safety valves;\n\u00bf Excessive temperature: high temperature alarms, manual shutdowns, and automatic shutdowns;\n\u00bf Low temperature: insulation and heating;\n\u00bf Excessive flow: high flow alarms, \"fail safe\" position control valves, and pressure safety valves;\n\u00bf Low flow or no flow: low flow alarms, recycle streams, shutdown systems, and check valves;\n\u00bf High and low levels: high and low level alarms and shutdown systems;\n\u00bf Contamination: analyzers, check valves, and standardized utility connections.\n\u00bf Explosions: furnace instrumentation, control of ignition sources;\n\u00bf Loss of containment: isolation valves, proper material selection for corrosion and temperature, avoidance of dead legs, periodic inspection, proper water draws and sampling"

In addition, the refinery has a flare system that will safely burn vented materials from the process units.\n\nWhile the emphasis is on prevention of potential hazards, the facility also implements a number of mitigation measures in the event a release should occur. The RREC recognizes that early detection is an important part of managing a release. An example of a detection safeguard would be that process and storage areas have leak detection systems for hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia. In addition, the facility has perimeter monitors for hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide as well as a fence-line monitoring system. Mitigation is also an important part of managing an accidental release. \n\nAs part of safeguarding against escalation of an event, the facility has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe RMP regulation requires a listing of accidents for the past 5 years from covered processes that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.
