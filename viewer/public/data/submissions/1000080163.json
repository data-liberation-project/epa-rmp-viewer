      "SummaryText": "Lincoln Premium Poultry - Fremont, NE\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nRMP Hazard Assessment Information\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is considered hazardous under 40 CFR part 68. The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling this chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the potential impact or threat to nearby members of the community and or environment. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chemicals; combined with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility; and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe facility uses ammonia throughout the facility as a refrigerant liquid. The ammonia liquid is fully contained within process piping and equipment in a closed loop system. Release scenarios were discussed as part of the Process Hazard Analysis and a Worst Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario were selected for Risk Management Planning.\n\nWorst Case Scenario: The scenario is based on a catastrophic failure of the largest vessel and complete release of 52,582 lbs of Ammonia. Assumption parameters such as release duration (10 minutes), wind speed (1.5m/s), atmospheric conditions (Stability F), temperature (25 ?C, 77 ?F) were specified by the RMP Comp The release rate of 2,980 lbs./minute was programmed into the RMP Comp Software that was used to model the Toxic Endpoint. A release inside an enclosed space was factored into the scenario calculation and reduced the release rate. The RMP Comp scenario calculator determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 3.1 miles. The toxic endpoint and potential off site receptors are identified on the attached map.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: The scenario is based on a rooftop piping leak releasing 3,000 lbs of ammonia in a period of 10 minutes. The RMP Comp scenario calculator showed that the incident resulted in effecting a 0.2 mile area to its toxic endpoint. Assumption parameters such as release duration"

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Lincoln Premium Poultry is required to and has implemented a Facility Emergency Action Plan. If an emergency was to occur, we have trained personnel and equipment ready for response in the event of a spill of hazardous materials. It is also our policy to notify the Fremont Nebraska Fire Department (via the 911 system), and request that they respond to the emergency if the emergency is beyond our capabilities.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and will comply with all applicable state codes and regulations. Lincoln Premium Poultry takes a systematic, proactive approach to evaluating chemical processes. Using this approach, the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process changes, and other elements that affect the covered processes are all considered. By conducting thorough evaluations, accidental releases are prevented and the consequences of releases are minimized.\n\nBy fulfilling the required elements of the RMP standards, Lincoln Premium Poultry intends to prevent releases of hazardous substances and minimize the impacts of accidental releases, especially into locations that could expose employees, the community or the environment to serious hazards. Our management systems address each of the key features of a successful release prevention program including:\n\n-    Maintaining Process Safety Information (PSI): Lincoln Premium Poultry maintains up-to date technical information about safe operating limits of the processes and associated hazards of the chemicals involved.\n\n-    Conducting "
