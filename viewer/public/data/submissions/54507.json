      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nAt the turn of this century water borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States.  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine's introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.  \n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that the use of chlorine is not risk free.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n\nThe City of Fort Lauderdale Public Services Department has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.  The City's track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, the City has taken a comprehensive approach to be in "

The facility's mission is to protect public health by providing our community with safe drinking water, free of harmful pathogens.  Approximately 3,600 pounds per day of chlorine gas are used to disinfect the water and make it safe for human consumption.  A maximum of 202,000 pounds of chlorine are stored on-site.  The chlorine is stored as a gas that is liquefied under pressure.\n\nCHLORINE PROCESS AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT\nThe Fiveash WTP chlorine system is a liquid feed system.  Under normal operations, chlorine is supplied to the process from a railcar that contains 90-tons of chlorine.  Two chlorine containers (each holding 2,000 pounds of chlorine) are also connected to the chlorine supply header and are used to supply chlorine to the process during the changeout of an empty railcar for a new railcar.\n\nThe liquid chlorine process operates by feeding chlorine to the evaporators.  The liquid chlorine in the evaporator is contained in a pressure vessel.  A hot water bath surrounding the pressure vessel transfers heat to the chlorine, which in turn vaporizes into a gas.  Chlorine gas flows under pressure from the evaporator to the vacuum regulator-check unit (VRCU).  At the VRCU, the gas pressure is reduced to a slight vacuum.  The vacuum created in the injector assemblies pulls the chlorine gas from the VRCU through the chlorinators (which control the flowrate of gas) and into the injectors.  The chlorine gas is mixed with water in the injectors to form a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is then fed to the various application points.\n\nThe major safety equipment associated with this process includes a chlorine leak detector system with alarms, automatic shut off valves, and excess flow valves.

      "SummaryText": "ne leak detectors are located in the chlorine storage areas, evaporator room, and chlorinator room and will activate audible and visual alarms in addition to activating the automatic shut off valves located at the rail car and transfer hose which will stop the supply of chlorine to the plant in the event there is a chlorine leak.  In addition, excess flow valves in the 90-ton railcar are designed to shut off the flow from the railcar header pipe if it is broken off.\n\nAMMONIA PROCESS AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT\nThe anhydrous ammonia system was replaced in December of 2006 with an aqueous ammonia system that is not regulated under the Risk Management Program.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OVERVIEW\nChlorine is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation which can be found in 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) regulation which can be found in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe primary components of the RMP are as follows:\n\n*     A five-year accident history\n*     An off-site consequence analysis for a worst-case and alternative release scenario\n*     A comprehensive prevention program to minimize risks (i.e. minimize the potential for a release)\n*     An emergency response program to ensure that an accidental release is appropriately handled\n*     An overall management program to supervise the implementation of the RMP\n\nFollowing development of the RMP, the facility submitted a Risk Management Plan (Plan) to the EPA in June of 1999.  The Plan is a summary of the facility's Risk Management Program.  The RMP will be updated every five years, or whenever a process changes or a new process is added.  The OSHA PSM regulation has basically the same requirements as the prevention program element of the EPA RMP.  The Fiveash WTP RMP meets the requirements of both regulations.\n\nThe following sections briefly summarize the elements of the RMP"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Fiveash WTP has used chlorine to disinfect water since 1954.  Anhydrous Ammonia was used in the disinfection process from 1983 to the end of 2006. Anhydrous Ammonia was replaced with Aqueous Ammonia in January of 2007. In the last five years, the facility has had no accidental releases, which were required to be reported under the RMP regulation.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst case release scenario for a toxic gas has been defined by the EPA to be an accidental release in which the largest on-site vessel, containing the regulated chemical, releases its contents as a gas over ten minutes.  Since the facility's  largest chlorine container stores 180,000 pounds, the worst case release scenario is a release of 180,000 pounds of chlorine over 10 minutes.  This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3 parts per million (ppm) for chlorine. \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative release is a \"more likely\" incident than the worst-case.  The RMP regulation allows the owner to define the alternative release scenario based on historical experience or operations staff knowledge of their system.   The alternative release scenario for chlorine was to assume that the railcar transfer pipe failed.  This scenario assumed that the release was mitigated by the excess flow valves in the system.  This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3 ppm for chlorine.  \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThere are always inherent risks associated with handling and using chlorine.  These risks include the potential inhalation of chlorine gas if it is accidentally released.  The prevention program is a key component to reducing the risk associated with a potential chlorine gas release.  Key elements of the prevention program include:\n\n*     Employee participation\n*     Process safety information\n*     Process hazard analysis\n*     Incident investigation\n*     Standard"

Effective SOPs, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the system and in preventing accidental releases.\n\nThe purpose of the mechanical integrity program is to ensure the continued integrity of the process equipment.  An effective mechanical integrity program is integral to preventing accidental releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment.  The Fiveash WTP's mechanical integrity program includes maintenance, inspection, and testing procedures and schedules along with maintenance personnel training.\n\nKnowledgeable well-trained personnel are essential to preventing and mitigating the effects of accidental chemical releases. The Fiveash WTP's training program ensures that personnel working on or near the chlorine systems are adequately trained in the operation and maintenance procedures and the appropriate response actions to an accidental release.\n\nThe process hazard analysis is a valuable risk reduction tool that outlines deficiencies in equipment and procedures, identifies potential system failure modes, and provides recommendations for system and operational improvements.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nA comprehensive emergency response program has been prepared which outlines the procedures and lines of communication that are necessary to effectively respond to and mitigate a potential chlorine "

The facility emergency response program includes procedures for notifying the local hazardous materials (hazmat) teams of the incident and procedures for evacuating the facility.  There are four local hazmat teams in Broward County that can respond to mitigate an accidental release.  Facility staff have coordinated with the local fire department to ensure that they are fully trained and equipped to quickly respond to an incident.  Fiveash WTP staff will practice the emergency response procedures in an annual training drill.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe City of Fort Lauderdale Public Services Department has undertaken a study to review the costs and qualitative issues of changing to an alternative (i.e., safer) disinfection system.  The chlorine alternatives being evaluated include switching to on-site generation of sodium hypochlorite (at 0.8% concentration) and purchasing bulk hypochlorite (at 12% concentration).  In addition, these alternatives will be compared to staying with chlorine gas and enclosing the existing facilities (to contain a chlorine leak) and adding an emergency chlorine scrubber.  The results of this report have indicated that an on-site sodium hypochlorite generation system will offer the most benefit to the City. Work is currently underway on the design of the generation facility and the formulation of bid documents.\n \nSafety improvements recently installed include the following:\n\n*    Leak detectors with local and remote audible and visual alarms at all chlorine storage locations.\n\n*    The addition of automatic shut-off valves on the chlorine railcar and transfer hose."
