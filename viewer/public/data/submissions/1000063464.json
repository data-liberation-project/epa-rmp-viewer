The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.  The last evacuation drill was performed on 5-4-16.\n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Lineage Logistics University Park, Illinois continues to commit resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of Lineage Logistics' high degree of commitment to public safety and service, Lineage Logistics is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Lineage Logistics facilities refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporator"

The results are mitigated by the fact that most of the vessels and some of the piping are inside the Lineage Logistics building.  A variety of administrative and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.  \n\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\n\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place.

The five-year accident history\n\n\n\nWithin the five-year accident history: there have been no reportable ammonia release related incidents. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Lineage Logistics is continuing to implement a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n\n\n Emergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.  Lineage Logistics has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Lineage Logistics conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nLineage Logistics is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis and Compliance Audit conducted in 2015.  The flexibility of the program allows Lineage Logistics to respond effectively to prevent and/or minimize any potential exposure to Lineage Logistics employees, the surrounding public, and the environment of a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
