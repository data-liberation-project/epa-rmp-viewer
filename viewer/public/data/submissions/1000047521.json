      "SummaryText": "Endicott Island is the first continuous operating offshore oilfield in the Arctic and is classified as NAICS code 211111, Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas Extraction.  Current production is approximately 8,200 bbls per day.\r\n\r\nEndicott is located approximately 2.5 miles from Alaska's northern coast in the Beaufort Sea.  A three-mile man-made gravel causeway connects Endicott's two man-made gravel islands.  The 45-acre Main Production Island (MPI) was constructed as a self-contained facility and can house up to 150 employees and contractors.  The MPI has its own operating and processing, living facilities, life support systems, medical clinic, firefighting and spill response equipment.  An operating and support crew of about 50 employees and contractors work on the MPI at any one time.\r\n\r\nPipelines are supported above ground on steel support structures.  Oil and gas liquids are transported from production wells on the MPI where oil, water and gas are separated.  Sales oil is then shipped down a 26-mile pipeline where it enters the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substance\r\n\r\nEndicott utilizes a regulated substance, propane, in a dry gas refrigeration system.  The propane refrigeration system is a closed circulating loop.  Liquid propane is purchased commercially, trucked to Endicott and added to the surge drum as needed.  The propane system consists of the following equipment and approximate inventories:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tV-1405 propane suction drum provides vaporized propane to the propane compressor.  At normal operating level, the suction drum contains approximately 1,450 gallons @ 4.8 lbs/gal = 6960 lbs.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tK-1405 propane compressor raises the system pressure and forces the propane vapor through a condenser.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tV-1406 propane surge drum provides storage for the condensed propane and supplies liquid propane to the flash drum.  At normal operating level, the surge drum contains approximately 3,390 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 14240 lbs.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tV-1407 propane flash drum provides"

      "SummaryText": "liquid propane storage.  At normal operating level, the flash drum contains approximately 1,315 gallons @ 4.8 lbs/gal = 6,315 lbs.\r\n\r\nTotal propane inventory onsite is approximately 27,500 lbs.  V-1405, V-1406, and V-1407 are located outside of module 303 in the NW corner. Catastrophic loss of inventory of the propane closed loop system is the basis for the Worst Case Scenario calculations.  The model used was EPA's OCA Guidance Reference tables or equations.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Endicott Emergency Action Plan (EAP) covers responses for situations in which there is probable loss of life, extensive injuries, environmental damage, or significant business interruption to normal operations. The emergency procedures comply with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans), 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER) and apply to all Hilcorp Alaska, LLC., contractors and visitors.  This plan includes information on alarms, evacuation plans, safe briefing areas, containment, control, cleanup and emergency notification procedures. \r\n\r\nAs described in the EAP facility employees undergo a variety of training to prepare for emergency situation.  These include evacuation drills, total island evacuation drills, Endicott Response Team joint training exercises, rescue training, personal protective equipment training, and Incident Command System training.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical -Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Endicott facility utilizes various detection alarm systems designed to warn of abnormal conditions that could result in injury to personnel, property damage, or damage to the environment.  An amber light visual alarm signals a problem with the propane system. These detection systems are tested on a set maintenance schedule to assure their operation. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response \r\n\r\nEndicott Operations has its own professionally-trained fire department which responds and serves as the local fire department"

      "SummaryText": ".  There is no other jurisdiction providing emergency response at Endicott, with the exception of mutual aid provided by the fire departments of other nearby North-Slope Alaska oil fields.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the volunteers in the fire department, Endicott trains employees for other spill response roles including Operation Level First Responders and Specialized Employees (Operators).\r\n\r\nOperations Level First Responders are trained to respond to an emergency in a defensive manner without actually trying to stop the release.  Their function is to contain the release from a safe distance, keep it from spreading, and prevent exposures.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Employees (Operators) are personnel who are qualified to operate the facility/well pads during routine day-to-day activities.  Their duties are to identify the nature, location and scope of the emergency as well as performing source control.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nEndicott Island's propane system has not had a reportable accident or incident with offsite consequences in the last five years.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPlanned changes include considering PHA recommendations to improve the process integrity and management of change system."
