Vertex was purchased by Hawkins in 2011.  Hawkins corporate office now oversees all aspects of this program and the Vertex facility works closely with the corporate office to stay in compliance, so both Hawkins and Vertex names will be used in this Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nHawkins and Vertex were very similar in nature, both in how they started out, and chemicals handled.  Both started out as small family owned businesses (Hawkins started in 1938 and Vertex in 1949).  Both have a long history of manufacturing sodium hypochlorite and using chlorine - the only chemical regulated by both PSM and RMP at this facility.  Both are active members in the Chlorine Institute and adhere to their guidelines.  The merging of these two companies has made both companies stronger as best practices are reviewed and the utilization of combined resources occur (employee knowledge, equipment, outside resources, etc.).  Hawkins is a publicly traded company.\r\n\r\nThis facility batch manufactures sodium hypochlorite using chlorine, sodium hydroxide and water, providing water and waste-water treatment, pulp and paper, and pool chemicals to improve the quality of life and operate in concert with the environment.\r\n\r\nVertex Chemical Corporation has been using this process to manufacture bleach since 1968 and started manufacturing at this facility on President's Island, Memphis, TN in 1997.    \r\n\r\nThe Memphis facility is sited remote from immediate population groups, in an industrial area with space, fences, security, natural obstacles separating the areas from casual public.  Secondary security fencing is located around the chlorine railcar unloading area to keep unauthorized personnel away from the chlorine unloading area.  Batch process is set up as close as possible to the chlorine railcars to reduce pipeline distance which reduces the amount o"

Be Safe!\" regarding accidents and injuries.  Support for this motto is manifested in several ways, including:\r\n1.\tA corporate Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) department staffed with trained professionals.\r\n2.\tTraining programs in chemical safety, safe material handling, accident prevention and emergency response.\r\n3.\tPrompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.\r\n4.\tAdherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations.\r\n5.\tCompliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping and materials.\r\n6.\tInternal and 3rd party audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\r\n7.\tMembers in good standing with the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  This facility is a chemical distribution and manufacturing facility that handles several products used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses.  This site manufactures sodium hypochlorite (also known as bleach).  Chlorine is part of this manufacturing process.  Chlorine is the only chemical covered by Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan for this facility.  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through safe handling procedures and safety systems that properly protect chlorine during receipt, storage and use.  This starts with DOT FRA approved 90-ton railcars that are robustly designed to contain chlorine through expected conditions during transport, storage and unloading.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures and equipping them with equipment to safely transfer ch"

Procedures and training for handling chlorine during manufacturing of sodium hypochlorite;\r\n2. Implement safety systems to manage risks identified during process hazard analysis;\r\n3. Conduct necessary plant maintenance and inspections to ensure equipment is in good working order;\r\n4. Vendor provided DOT approved railcars;\r\n5. Adhere to OSHA workplace safety regulations;\r\n6. Follow Chlorine Institute standards.\r\n7. Members in good standings with National Association of Chemical Distributors\r\n\r\n5-year Accident History:  There has not been an accident involving chlorine at this facility in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response:  In the event of a maintenance issue with chlorine equipment/railcar, employees are trained on how to detect the source of the issue and take appropriate action such as closing or tightening a valve.  If an accidental release should occur, this facility has a trained on-site hazmat team including proper equipment (SCBA and C-kits) to respond.  This facility also conducts annual meetings and training sessions with the local emergency planning committee and hazardous materials responders (Memphis/Shelby County Special Emergency Association) and the Memphis Local Fire Department to ensure everyone is aware of the hazards at this site.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes:  While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than to continue compliance with industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to \"Think Safe!
