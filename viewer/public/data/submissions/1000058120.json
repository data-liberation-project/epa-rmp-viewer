USA (Cutrale) Dade City facility (the Facility) is located at 38000 Cargill\r\nWay, Dade City, Pasco County, Florida 33523. The Facility is a critical part of Cutrale's Florida citrus\r\nprocessing operations. The Facility's main functions includes shipping and receiving blending juices from\r\noranges.\r\n\r\nCutrale is committed to operating this and other Cutrale facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and\r\nsafety of Cutrale and Contractor employees, the public, and the environment. In addition, Cutrale is committed\r\nto operating this and other Cutrale facilities in full compliance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health\r\nAdministration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the Facility is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable OSHA and EPA\r\nregulations relevant to accidental release prevention, Cutrale has developed this integrated Process Safety\r\nManagement/Risk Management Plan (the Plan). Among the important components of this Plan are Cutrale's\r\nsystem of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the Facility, and Cutrale's Emergency\r\nResponse Plan (ERP) for the Facility. Cutrale has designated its corporate Manager of Quality Process and\r\nEnvironmental Compliance and the Facility's Director of Auburndale Operations as the individuals with primary\r\nresponsibility and accountability for seeing that this Plan and its associated components accurately reflect\r\nFacility conditions and that it is fully implemented.\r\n\r\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nPOLICY SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Facility is designed to ship and receive juices from locally grown citrus fruits. These products are sold\r\ndirectly to a reseller. To support these primary functions, the Facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThe refriger"

The basic technology involves the re-circulation of ammonia, with a change in state from\r\nliquid to a liquid/gas mixture, then back to a liquid.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is delivered to the Facility in its liquid state and is stored in a high-pressure receiver. From the high\r\npressure receiver, the liquid ammonia is moved by pressure to a re-circulator or accumulator (different\r\nterminology indicating the same vessel, depending on the age of the vessel). Liquid is pumped from the recirculator\r\nor moved by pressure from the accumulator to the individual pieces of cooling equipment, which\r\ninclude chillers and air handlers serving production rooms, coolers, product storage tanks, and the like. As the\r\nliquid pulls heat from the surroundings it begins to evaporate. Since evaporation (as well as condensation)\r\noccurs at constant temperature, the result is a warm, low-pressure vapor where the liquid ammonia absorbs\r\nheat and changes to a vapor or liquid vapor mix. The warmed, lower pressure, vapor or liquid vapor mix returns\r\nto the re-circulator or accumulator where liquid and vapor is separated and just vapor is then pulled to a bank of\r\ncompressors. The compressor compresses the low pressure vapor to a high pressure vapor and is routed to\r\nthe condensers, which condense the ammonia to a high pressure liquid. This flow is then returned to the highpressure\r\nreceiver previously described.\r\n\r\nTo determine the maximum intended ammonia inventory, a complex calculation must be performed to account\r\nfor the quantity of ammonia in each of the major process vessels operating at their normal levels.\r\n\r\n1.3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Facility has an aggressive accidental release prevention program that is based upon a foundation of\r\nemployee awareness and proactive system maintenance. This program is documented in this integrated Plan.\r\nThis program meets or ex"

The operator was performing scheduled maintenance on the dual relief valve system when ammonia vapor started to release through the 1 inch port. The operator immediately closed the isolation valve stopping the ammonia leak. The estimated ammonia release was 34.9 lbs. One employee was sent to the hospital for a medical evaluation and then released. \r\n\r\n                 \r\n\r\n\r\n1.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Plan that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by Facility\r\nemployees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials. This ERP has been communicated to\r\nPasco County Fire Service and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\nIt is Cutrale's policy with regard to emergency response that its personnel are trained to the Hazardous\r\nMaterials Technician Level. These are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a hazardous substance\r\nrelease and who have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper\r\nauthorities of the release. These individuals also are trained to respond to a release by stopping the release,\r\nthereby assuming a more aggressive role than those trained to the First Responder Awareness Level. The\r\nERP describes the conditions under which Cutrale personnel would assist the local responders in attempt to\r\nstop a chemical release, as well as the sequence of actions that would be undertaken under those\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is Cutrale's policy for employees to call the Tank Farm Manager in the event of any release emergency.
