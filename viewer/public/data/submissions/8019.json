Two Board Members are appointed from each of the the three participiating counties:  the seventh is appointed by the Governor.\n\nIt is the policy to maintain an outstanding, extremely clean operation to prevent the suden release of any toxic into the air or the ground.  An outstanding and complete Emergency Action Plan has been developed and shared with the Local Area Planning Committee and local Fire Departments.  Superintendents are held to an extremely high standard and are accountable for their respective areas of operaion.  Each employee is empowered to resolve any issue immediaetly which could cause a release.  If they are not able to fix or repair, outside assisstance is called immediaetly.\n\nStationary source is of chlorine in one tone containers used in the treatemnt of wastewater.  There are two locations on site in enclosed areas.  They consist of two cylinders being connected to feed the system.  After the last PHA in June, 1999, it was decided to suggest a management of change procedure to explore the possibility of only using one tank at a time thereby reducing the total in the process to less than the TQ of 2,500 pounds.  may be executed by fall of 1999.\n\nWorst case secenario is offloading a one ton cylinder and causing a crack or rupture.  Total release would be 2000 pounds of Chlorine.  RMP Comp was used with a release time of 10 minutes at a  rate of 110 pounds per minute.  Wind speed 1.5 m/sec.  Toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles.  The primary receptor would be  Lick Creek recreation area on the Patoka Lake.  A state recreation area over two miles distance.  The forested area between facility and the marina is mature dense hardwood.  The vapor would disperse before reaching this point.\n\nAlternative release secenario i"

Employees are trained to respond and repair the leak or call outside repair service if it is outside of their abilities.  RMP Comp was used to determine endpoint of 0.10 miles, effectively staying on the facility property.  Maximun release of 535 pounds in an enclosed area with drains for a period of 5 minutes.\n\nARP is based on Process Safety Management for chlorine.  Daily and weekly inspections of equipment with immediate repairs of found problems.  Each employee is trained and must demonstrate both a cognitive and hands-on understanding of the chlorine process before allowed to operate as an individual.  Chlorine training occurs each year with a review of the Emergency Action Plan.  There are local alarms and indicators to a faulty system which are monitored 24 hours a day.  Management is keenly aware of the need to monitor the system and demands compliance from all employees in this matter.\n\nThere has been no releases in the past five years\n\nPatoka Lake Regional Water and Sewer District has an Emergency Response Plan which has been reviewed with all local Fire Departments and the Dubois County LEPC.  The last visit by the Fire Department was in JUly of 1995.  Additionally, one is planned for the summer of 1999 in the month of July.\n\nThe only possible planned change to the ARP at this time is to not use two chlorine tanks in line.  By limiting to just one tank it will decrease the exposure and possibility of a larger release should emergency shut-off fail.\n\nThe implemented Prevention Programs are as follows:\n\n     Emergency Action Plan\n     Process Safety Management which includes:\n     Process Hazard Analysis\n              Management of Change\n              Pre-start up review\n              Contractor safety      \n     Operating procedures\n     Training\n     Incident/accident Investigation\n     Compliance auditing\n     Employee participation"
