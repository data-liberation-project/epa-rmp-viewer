      "SummaryText": "The Water Resources Division of the City of Elizabeth City has adopted a Process Safety Program in order to implement 29 CFR 1910.119, the OSHA Standard Regulating Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and to enable all those who  may be affected to be able to be able to  identify and understand the hazards posed by the processes that involve those chemicals.  This program will help prevent the occurance of, or minimize the consiquences of catstrophic release by stating our policies and proceedures for the management of process hazards and design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection and maintenance.  Our program calls for the maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provision of the OSHA standard.  The program will be regularly reviewd and updated whenever necessary to reflect new or modified tasks and proceedures.\n\nThe 2004 update reflects the removal of the standing HAZMAT team, which the City no longer has.  We now rely on the Pasquotank/Camden/Elizabeth City LEPC, the US Coast Guard and the personnell from the chemical supllier UNIVAR.  The update also reflects several name changes resulting from personnell  changes.  The same modeling information put forth in the original 1999 document was retained.\n\nThe plan covers water/wastewater treatment processes that utilize liquid chlorine in one ton cylinders for disinfection, fed through a vacuum system.  There are gas detectors, loss of vacuum detectors, exhaust fans and audible alarms associated with the system.  They are located in enclosed structures.\n\nThe facility has had no reportable accidental releases of fchlorine in the last ten years."
