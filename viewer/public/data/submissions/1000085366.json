This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the Costco Wholesale Tracy Meat Plant.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the Costco Wholesale Tracy Meat Plant to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  If such a release does occur, the facility's emergency response personnel are trained to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Tracy Rural Fire Protection District as well as the local Hazardous Materials Response team, who provide additional emergency response expertise and support as needed.\n\n\n\nRoutine inspections by regulatory agencies such as the local fire department, Certified Unified Program Agency (San Joaquin County Environmental Health Department), USDA, etc. ensure that the facility remains in compliance and operating safely.  Costco Wholesale also institutes internal audits and inspections by both corporate environmental representatives, as well as third party consultants and contractors which enable the Tracy Meat Plant to continue safe and efficient operations.\n\n  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Costco facility processes ground beef and hot dogs and produces several packaged meat products that are sold in Costco Wholesale retail locations worldwide.  The facility is located at 17880 W. Schulte Road in Tracy, California.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown and startup, and emergency shutdown and startup. This information is regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators and/or contractors who are involved in the routine operations of the ammonia refrigeration process.  In the event of changes to either the design or operations of the ammonia system, the Operating Procedures are updated / revised to ensure they remain accurate and current.\n\n\n\nTraining \n\nCostco Wholesale Tracy Meat Plant has an on-the-job training program in place to ensure that employees who operate ammonia process equipment are competent in the ammonia refrigeration system as well as the Operating Procedures associated with each piece of equipment.  Outside schooling resources (including both live classes and online modules) are utilized for key personnel to ensure a comprehensive understanding of continued safe operations.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years for each ammonia operator.  All training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system is documented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nCostco Wholesale Tracy Meat Plant has a written maintenance program in place that details the preventative maintenance tasks and frequencies for all ammonia equipment to ensure continued safe operation and reliability.

System maintenance is completed only by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices, including in-house personnel and contractors as needed.  Specialized training is provided as needed to ensure maintenance personnel are fully qualified.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change \n\nWritten procedures are followed at Costco Wholesale Tracy Meat Plant to manage changes in the design of the ammonia process, technology, equipment, and procedures.  This ensures that ammonia operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to fully understand the scope of the modification.
