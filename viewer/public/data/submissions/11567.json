The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of H.G. & N Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintainance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire dept. and the local emergencey planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 84,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenerio would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards an company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .96 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistant with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage"

The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provide to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned changes for improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on going process at the facilty.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintainance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementations at this time."
