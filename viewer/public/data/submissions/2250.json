      "SummaryText": "     Deweese Agri Service is a business that handles fertilizer and chemicals for farm use.  The only thing that we handle that is a threat to the general public would be anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is stored in a bulk tank holding no more than 40,000 lbs.  The tank is equiped with relief valves, excess flow valves, check valves and manual shut off valves equiped with locks.\n\n     If the tank were to begin leaking, the Clay County LEPC or 911 would be called to begin emergency action.  If it is safely possible for the employee, the employee would attempt to shut manual valves to slow or stop the leak.\n\n     Our five year accident history indicates no accidents or spills with no on or off site injuries.\n\n     An emergency plan is on file with the Clay County LEPC,  and the local fire department so that if they are called for an emergency, they will be able to handle it with efficency.  Our own employees are trained to know where the shut off valves are and how to operate them if they can safely do so."
