      "SummaryText": "The City of Chattanooga owns and operates Moccasin Bend Wastewater Treatment Plant (MBWWTP) in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  Chemicals commonly used at wastewater treatment plants that may be subject to PSM or RMP requirements include chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The threshold quantity of chlorine, sulfur dioxide and ozone for PSM applicability (29CFR1910.119) is 1,500 pounds and 1,000 pounds, respectively.  The threshold quantity for RMP applicability (40CFR Part 68) for chlorine, sulfur dioxide and chlorine dioxide is 2,500 pounds, 5,000 pounds and 1,000 pounds, respectively.  MBWWTP uses chlorine, which is classified as an extremely hazardous substance, for disinfection.  Therefore, the plant is subject to federal requirements including preparation of PSM and RMP programs (29CFR1910.119 and 40CFR Part 68).  These programs are intended to minimize the health risks to employees and the public from the accidental release of chemicals.\n\n\n\nA hard copy Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program Manual has been developed for MBWWTP and is on file in the Occupational Safety Specialist's Office.  The programs provide information on the hazardous properties of chlorine, delineate the area at risk in case of an accidental chlorine release and outline training and procedures designed to minimize the threat to health and environment in the area of consequence.\n\n\n\nStringent RMP requirements (known as Program 3 level) apply to MBWWTP because of Tennessee's OSHA jurisdiction.  All program level requirements are included in the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program Manual with the data elements which are submitted to EPA.\n\n\n\n"
