The organization of this executive summary follows the elements listed in the U.S. EPA's RMP*Submit Users Manual, with a brief introduction.\n\nIntroduction\n\nArizona Public Services (APS) owns and operates the West Phoenix Power Plant, an electric power generation facility located in Maricopa County, Arizona.  The existing units at the West Phoenix Power Plant include two simple-cycle turbines, three combined-cycle units, an auxiliary boiler, and three steam generating units.  APS is also adding two new natural gas-fired combined cycle power generation units.  As part of construction of the new units and retrofitting one existing combined cycle unit, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) control systems are being installed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The SCR system utilizes aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions.  Ammonia with concentrations of 20% or higher is listed as a regulated substance under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nAs a result of the SCR NOx control system, the quantity of aqueous ammonia to be stored and used at the facility will be greater than the Threshold Quantity, thus a Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required.  The aqueous ammonia system was identified as the only process at the facility that triggers RMP requirements.  As explained in the following sections, even the highly unlikely worst-case release from the aqueous ammonia system will not result in the toxic endpoint reaching beyond the property boundary.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies are supported at the highest level within the Company.  The facility is operated to protect the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, as well as to protect the environment.  To co"

      "SummaryText": "mmunicate this philosophy, APS has an ongoing environmental, health, and safety training program for employees.  In addition, a release such as that used for the worst case scenario is highly unlikely due to this ongoing training, and preventive maintenance inspections of the ammonia system.\n\n2. Description of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe West Phoenix Power Plant is located in the western portion of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area.  As mentioned, an SCR system is being installed to control NOx from a new unit and one existing unit.  The SCR system for the new unit will utilize aqueous ammonia at concentrations below 20%, thus it does not trigger the RMP requirements.\n\nThe existing unit (ID# CC3) will be retrofit with a system using a 29.4% solution of ammonia in water, ammonium hydroxide.  The ammonia storage and handling system for CC3 will consist of a single 30,000 gallon storage tank, pumps, and piping to the vaporizer, which produces a uniform distribution of aqueous ammonia injected into the flue gas upstream of the SCR catalyst.  The storage tank will have a maximum design pressure of 25 psia and be completely within a walled containment basin designed to hold all of the tank contents.  The tank will also have an administrative fill limit of 28,500 gallons.\n\n3. Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a release of the entire contents of the storage tank.  The tank is surrounded by a walled containment basin that limits the exposed surface area and reduces the release rate for the 29.4 wt.% aqueous ammonia.  Using EPA's Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, dated April 1999, the dike area is less than the area of a pool that could form and the containment area is sufficient to hold the entire volume.  Under worst-case meteorology as per the guidance (1.5 m/s and F stability) and adjusting the release rate for release temperature, the resulting distance to toxic endpoint from Reference Table 10 is 0.1 miles.  This dist"

      "SummaryText": "ance is contained within the property boundary.  The nearest public receptor is at least 800 feet away to the south, well beyond the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe worst-case release from the storage tank is predicted to remain on-site and is thus less than the distance to public or environmental receptors.  The facility has not had a release of a regulated substance in the past five years, thus it qualifies for Program 1 and an alternate release scenario is not required.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe aqueous ammonia system was designed to reduce potential offsite impacts by including a concrete dike to provide 100% containment around the storage tank.  Operators will receive ongoing training in accident prevention and chemical safety, will conduct visual inspections of the ammonia system routinely, as well as perform maintenance recommended by the equipment manufacturers to reduce the risk of accidents.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of a regulated substance at the West Phoenix Power Plant in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nAPS is required to meet the requirements for Program 1, which includes coordination with the local emergency responders.  APS has coordinated emergency response with the Maricopa County Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAPS has an ongoing program of training, maintenance, and inspections in order to minimize the possibility of accidents.  Following start-up of the ammonia system the facility will evaluate procedures and implement recommendations as appropriate from ongoing review of operator training and inspection programs."
