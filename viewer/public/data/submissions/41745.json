This group monitors the on-site implementation of the Process Safety Management programs through periodic meetings at each regulated facility.  In addition, the corporate safety group in conjunction with the local facility managers are responsible for maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  This policy is administered through Costco Wholesale's safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout / tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n - To save lives.\n - To minimize and avoid injuries.\n - To protect the environment.\n - To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the Meat Plant ammonia refrigeration system at Costco Wholesale is currently in progress.  The facility processes ground beef and produces several packaged meat products that are sold in Costco Wholesale warehouses worldwide.  The facility is located at 17880 W. Schulte Road in Tracy, California.  The ammonia refrigeration system is being constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations includ"

      "SummaryText": "ing the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe Meat Plant ammonia refrigeration system uses a maximum of 40,000 pounds of ammonia for meat processing equipment, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the Meat Plant engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the machine room roof and all of the evaporators and process freezers are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the Costco Wholesale facility will operate in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Trained operators at the Meat Plant will maintain the refrigeration system on a daily basis.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, will be hired to periodically inspect the refrigeration system and assist in maintaining it.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility, including the ammonia system, is being designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include ammonia leak detectors in the engine rooms and the cold storage/process areas and automatic safety shut down mechanisms for the compressors.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that protect the integrity of the equipment in case of a high pressure situation.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia"

      "SummaryText": " is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that outlines regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has not begun operating.  Therefore, there is no accident history to report. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has developed an emergency action plan.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the local Tracy Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the county Hazardous Materials Response Team.  If an accidental release of ammonia occurs, the State Governor's Office of Emergency Services and San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services will be called.  The facility will notify the National Response Center for releases above 100 pounds (in a 24 hour period).  \n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The Assistant Vice President will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he/she is not available.  Costco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility including the maintenance manager and the assistant managers.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammon"

A PHA study was completed in December 2004 that generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility. Costco Wholesale is proceeding with the mitigation measures associated with this study.\n\nThe corporate safety group has also implemented an annual program to review the PSM and RMP programs at each of the facilities to ensure on-going compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  In addition, the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year to help with their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for Costco Wholesale employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.Continue to train all employees in Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's Risk Management Program, and the California Accidental Release Prevention program.\n2.Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining the above mentioned safety programs via the facility's Employee Participation program.\n3.Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
