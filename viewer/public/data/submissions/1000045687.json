Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\n\r\nCompleted in 2000, the Sea-3 of Florida Tampa Terminal provides a vital energy service to homeowners, commercial businesses, and industry.  The facility has an excellent safety record and its employees are key players in achieving that safety record.\r\n\r\nSea-3 of Florida is committed to safe and reliable operation for the protection of its employees, the community, and the environment.  Sea-3 of Florida is proud of its operating record.  There has never been an incident that resulted in any offsite impacts to neighboring industries, residents or the community at large. This record has been achieved through consistent attention and total dedication by management and staff to safe operating practices and preventive maintenance.  Sea-3 of Florida continuously stays abreast of the latest technology and practices in operating and maintaining their Tampa Terminal.  These practices form the backbone of Sea-3's dedication to keeping the facility and the community safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Description of the Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\r\n\r\nThe Sea-3 of Florida Tampa Terminal imports and stores fully refrigerated liquid propane (also called liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) at -45A\u00b0F.  The terminal processes this product by heating it to +40A\u00b0F for shipment to its customers by truck and by barge.  Ethyl mercaptan, an odorizing agent, is added to the LPG distributed from the terminal.  Both propane and ethyl mercaptan are regulated flammable substances.  The terminal has no RMP listed toxic chemicals in threshold quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe terminal was designed and built in accordance with provisions of the following three recognized standards for LPG facilities:\r\n\r\n*  NFPA 58, Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases, (National Fire Protection Association).\r\n\r\n*  API 2510, Design and Construction of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Installations, (American Petroleum Instit"
