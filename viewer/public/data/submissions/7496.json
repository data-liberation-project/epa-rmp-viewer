      "SummaryText": "The City of Wichita Falls desires to provide a safe working environment for its employees and the public.  To accomplish this, management will provide all reasonable safe guards to ensure safe working conditions.  The joint cooperation of employees and management in the observation of this policy will provide safe working condtions and accident free performance, and will be to the mutual advantage of all.\nThis RMP is designed to provide for the safe use and storage of Chlorine, Ammonia, Sulfur Dioxide and Methane.  Worst case and Alternate Scenario analysis were performed using computer software \"RMP COMP\".  Default values were used with the software to yield a very conservative program.  The Cty of Wichita Falls management is conscious of the dangers asociated with the use and storage of these chemicals.  Therefore, controls are included in this RMP to ensure that all employees are properly trained, that equip[ment is maintained and safe conditions prevail.\nManagements commitment to safety is evidenced by our safety record.  One very minor accident at the Water Plant and two minor accidents at the Wastewater Plant were quickly and safely dealt with.  All three accidents were confined to the plant grounds by the quick actions of trained employees.  In house personnel are highly trained, yet we have backup help through the Fire Departments Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Team.\nThis plan documents the City's commitment to safety throughout the planning process.  By providing our employees with proper training, the proper tools and the support needed, we are able to provide the public with the safety they require for maximum enjoyment of our community."
