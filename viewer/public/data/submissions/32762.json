Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Virginia Occupational Safety and Health (VOSH) procedures have served as guidelines and standards in the development of this program and are adhered to.  The Plant emergency response policy involves the creation of an emergency response plan which will incorporate response capabilities available both internally and from the community.\n\nB.\tThe Carvins Cove Filtration Plant was established in 1946 to disinfect and treat drinking water for the City of Roanoke as well as selected areas of other localities.  The Plant is located at 8192 Angel Lane in Roanoke County, Virginia.  Chlorine gas is used to disinfect finished drinking water.  The chlorination system includes a chlorination supply room which contains gas chlorine cylinders, the initial components of the gaseous chlorine distribution system and safety equipment; an instrument room which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine actually utilized is two one-ton cylinders of chlorine with two additional cylinders serving as reserves.  There are approximately 10 other one-ton cylinders in storage.   The facility is manned 24 hours per day by water treatment operators with approximately 15 employees on daylight shift and 5 employees on the night shift.  All process areas are continuously monitored through the use of control center monitoring as well as hourly walk-throughs by employees.\n\nC.\tThe general Water Authority accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\u00bf\tHigh level of operator training\n\u00bf\tPreventive maintenance program\n\u00bf\tUse of state of the art processes and safety equipment\n\u00bf\tP"

Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted every six months as well as the review of the emergency plans and procedures.\n\nF.\tThirty-four changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in May 1997 and have been evaluated and implemented as required."
