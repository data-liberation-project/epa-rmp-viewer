This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. San Mateo's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Marlan Processing Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Marlan Processing Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\n\nThe facility is a non-fractionating NGL extraction plant that is designed to process natural gas. Plant the is designed for 60 MMSCFD. The facility consists of the following: inlet gas separation and filtration, inlet compression, dehydration, regeneration systems, condensate stabilization, amine treatment unit, cryogenic processing units, refrigeration systems, residue compression, flare system, and all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in four 400-barrel atmospheric tanks located within secondary containment areas and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGL from the cryogenic units and natural gas from residue compression are sent offsite via pipeline without intermediate storage.\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains two sources of a reg"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the regulated substance in the facility.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Marlan Processing Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.\tTanks are gauged\n2.\tTanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n3.\tHigh/Low alarms and shutdowns\n4.\tFacility is staffed 24-hours a day, 7-days a week\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.\tBerms around tanks\n2.\tProcess relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels from rupturing\n3.\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n4.\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n5.\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\nRelease Mitigation\n1.\tTrained emergency response personnel\n2.\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n3.\tSPCC Plan\n4.\tFire extinguishers\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Marlan Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accoun"

In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to facility processes. The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Marlan Processing Plant is coordinated with the Eddy County LEPC. The Eddy County Emergency Management can be reached at 575-628- 5450 for non-emergencies or by calling 911 in case of an emergency. The Marlan Processing Plant has around-the-clock communications capability. Pronto operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Loving, Hobbs or Malaga Fire Departments). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. Pronto conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Pronto Processing Plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\nThe Marlan Processing Plant has not had any accidents as of the date of this RMP.
