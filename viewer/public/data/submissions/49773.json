This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our accidental release prevention programs. \n\n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each covered process unit. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHAs are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n4.\tStandard Operating Procedures\n\nWritten standard operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery process units.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and acc"
