The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as commodities in the production of consumer products also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the handling and production processes to control human and environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nIt is Sterling Fibers' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.  However, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at Sterling Fibers and we often adhere to standards and practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals that are more strict than the applicable laws, rules and regulations to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction.  Investigation of inherently safer technologies, hazardous chemical inventory reduction and/or elimination studies, and fail safe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements occurring at Sterling Fibers.  Safety depends upon our management commitment, the manner in which we handle and process chemicals, the safety devices inherent to our process designs, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our workers.\r\n\r\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at Sterling Fibers.

This is no more evident than in our involvement in the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Our commitment to PSM standards is a strong example of management's commitment to continuously make our Santa Rosa plant a safe worksite.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we believe employee involvement is the cornerstone to continued safe operations.  We call it employee ownership and its success it portrayed through our lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved operating efficiencies at the Santa Rosa Plant.  Annual interactive training tailored to plant operations, helps provide employees with the information and attitudes to work safely and responsibly.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually of the natural type, such as hurricanes, or freezes.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of onsite emergencies such as spills, fire, explosion or a chemical release.  As a responsible company, Sterling Fibers provides the emergency response teams with state-of-the-art equipment and the latest training and procedures.  This ensures prompt mitigation actions during incidents and rapid notification to any surrounding neighborhood that may be inadvertently affected by a plant emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nSterling Fibers is an independently, privately owned company.

Cutting, baling, and shipping operate 5 days a week Monday through Friday as needed to satisfy customer orders.\r\n\r\nWe presently handle three regulated chemicals which are considered hazardous by EPA, Acrylonitrile, Vinyl Acetate Monomer, and Chlorine.  However, only Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate Monomer are present in quantities greater that the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore are included in our risk management program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Sterling Fibers, Inc is subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code (2824).

The EPA madates companies presume the release of the entire quantity of the substance.  Only passive mitigation efforts such as those controls in place that do not require action by an employee to initiate are allowed to be considered.  An example of passive mitigation is diking which provides a secondary containment system designed to contain 110% of all chemical leaks/spills and to prevent any chemicals form getting to the groundwater or bay.\r\n\r\nToxic Substance:  Toxic endpoints were completed using RMP Submit 2004 Software Version3.1.1.

Alternate release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternate release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence line.  Conditions considered for alternate release scenarios are: a release rate dependent upon scenario; use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source; the actual release height; and consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.  Facilities are allowed to include active mitigation.  Active mitigation includes procedures and equipment which are used to contain or minimize the impact of an accidental release.

The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \r\n\r\n8) Mechanical Integrity:  Sterling Fibers has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

This is a type of response management system that has been used successfully in a variety of emergency situations including releases of oil or hazardous substances.  It is a nationally recognized system currently in use by numerous federal, state, and local organizations.\r\n\r\nSterling Fibers ICP consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedure s address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation and accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, incident mitigation and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  The plant routinely performs maintenance on emergency equipment including tests and inspections and provides employee training on equipment use.  Employees receive training as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The ICP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes, equipment, and design.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for Sterling Fibers is coordinated with the Santa Rosa County Emergency Management officials and 911 system, the Avalon Beach-Mulat Volunteer Fire Department, and the Milton Fire Department.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nSterling Fibers primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are assigned to responsible personnel for resolution.
