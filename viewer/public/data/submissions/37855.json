The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as commodities in the production of consumer products also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the handling and production processes to control human and environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nIt is Sterling Fibers' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.  However, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at Sterling Fibers and we often adhere to standards and practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals that are more strict than the applicable laws, rules and regulations to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction.  Investigation of inherently safer technologies, hazardous chemical inventory reduction and/or elimination studies, and fail safe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements occurring at Sterling Fibers.  Safety depends upon our management commitment, the manner in which we handle and process chemicals, the safety devices inherent to our process designs, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our workers.\n\n\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at Sterling Fibers.

This is no more evident than in our involvement in the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Our commitment to PSM standards is a strong example of management's commitment to continuously make our Santa Rosa plant a safe worksite.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we believe employee involvement is the cornerstone to continued safe operations.  We call it employee ownership and its success it portrayed through our lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved operating efficiencies at the Santa Rosa Plant.  Annual interactive training tailored to plant operations, helps provide employees with the information and attitudes to work safely and responsibly.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually of the natural type, such as hurricanes, or freezes.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of onsite emergencies such as spills, fire, explosion or a chemical release.  As a responsible company, Sterling Fibers provides the emergency response teams with state-of-the-art equipment and the latest training and procedures.  This ensures prompt mitigation actions during incidents and rapid notification to any surrounding neighborhood that may be inadvertently affected by a plant emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nSterling Fibers is an independently, privately owned company.  The Santa Rosa Plant produces acrylic fiber from monomeric acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate.  Sterlings' synthetic acrylic fibers, which are nontoxic, are used for such consumer products as apparel, blankets, upholstery, and carpets, and technical products used in friction applications and filtration.\n\n\n\nThe Sterling Fibers Santa Rosa Plant is located in Section 31, Township 1 North, Range 29 West in Santa Rosa County, about 15 miles northeast of Pensacola.

Cutting, baling, and shipping operate 5 days a week Monday through Friday as needed to satisfy customer orders.\n\n\n\nWe presently handle three regulated chemicals which are considered hazardous by EPA, Acrylonitrile, Vinyl Acetate Monomer, and Chlorine.  However, only Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate Monomer are present in quantities greater that the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore are included in our risk management program.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Sterling Fibers, Inc is subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code (2824).  Therefore, the two Sterling Fibers' processes are classified as Program 3 processes under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n(    Acrylonitrile - Acrylonitrile is used in acrylic fiber stock and made into fabric and technical                                    products.

The EPA madates companies presume the release of the entire quantity of the substance.  Only passive mitigation efforts such as those controls in place that do not require action by an employee to initiate are allowed to be considered.  An example of passive mitigation is diking which provides a secondary containment system designed to contain 110% of all chemical leaks/spills and to prevent any chemicals form getting to the groundwater or bay.\n\n\n\nToxic Substance:  Toxic endpoints were completed using RMP Submit 2004 Software Version3.1.1.  Each of the regulated toxic substances at Sterling Fibers was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to endpoint.  \n\n\n\nFlammable Substance:  None\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe EPA rule also prescribes that alternate or more likely accident scenarios involving regulated chemicals are identified.  Alternate release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternate release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence line.  Conditions considered for alternate release scenarios are: a release rate dependent upon scenario; use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source; the actual release height; and consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.  Facilities are allowed to include active mitigation.  Active mitigation includes procedures and equipment which are used to contain or minimize the impact of an accidental release.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nSterling Fibers primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are assigned to responsible personnel for resolution.  Recommendations assigned are tracked using a computer database system.  Implementation or mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Sterling Fibers periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.\n\n\n\n4) Operating Procedures:  Sterling Fibers maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, \n\n(3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and \n\n(6) initial startup of a new process.

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\n\n\n\n6) Contractors:  Sterling Fibers uses contractors to supplement its workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place so that contractors (1) can perform their work in a safe manner, (2) should have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform their work safely, (3) can be aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) should understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) should understand and follow site safety rules, and \n\n(6) should inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, \n\n(2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Sterling Fibers evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
