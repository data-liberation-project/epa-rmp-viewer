              "Description": "Designing For Safety\n\n- The storage tanks are in a containment area designed to safely prevent spills from reaching the public.\n\n- Ammonia detectors at the railcar unloading station and storage tanks provide notification of leaks in these locations.\n\n- The tanks are equipped with pressure relief valves to prevent overpressurization of the tanks.  \n\n- The distribution header system is designed with excess flow stations that automatically close if an excess flow is present, preventing a large unwanted release.  \n\n- The unloading system consists of closed loop piping to minimize releases to the atmosphere.\n\nOperating Safely\n\n- The railcar is visually inspected before it is unloaded.\n\n- Personnel verify that the storage tanks can hold the entire contents of the railcar before the transfer is started.\n\n- Operating procedures require continual operator attendance during ammonia transfers to the storage tanks so reaction time to leaks is minimized.\n\n- Trained personnel continually monitor the ammonia system; a leak may be found by a detector or by an easily detectable odor. \n\n- The operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work within the ammonia system are trained and qualified in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.\n\n- Any changes to operating procedures or equipment are reviewed for potential impact on health, safety, and the environment using the Management of Change Process.\n\nMaintaining Safe Operations/Auditing Our Operations\n\n- The ammonia system is inspected on a routine basis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping, instrumentation, interlocks, and ESDs (as applicable).  Any discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n\n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is completed at least once every three years.\n\n- The area leak detection system is routinely checked by Certified Instrument Analysts.\n\n- The fire protection system is inspected, tested, and maintained per NFPA 25.\n\nAuditing Our Operations\n\n- Audits are completed at least once every three years in accordance with PSM/RMP requirements.",

              "Description": "Designing For Safety\n\n- The Department of Transportation (DOT) approved carriers are made of heavy gauge steel. \n\n- Cover lids at the end of the cylinder protect the cylinder valves.  The cylinder valves are recessed to prevent the valves from being damaged.  \n\n- The HF cylinders are not equipped with thermal or pressure relief devices.\n\n- The HF cylinder is stored in a concrete cubicle.  There is protected access to the HF cylinder, making a break in the cylinder improbable.\n\n- The HF cylinder cubicle is equipped with emergency shutdown systems which will mitigate releases.\n\n- HF detectors at the HF cylinder cubicle and in the production facilities provide notification of leaks in these locations and activate water systems designed to prevent HF vapors from traveling out of the immediate area.\n\n- Piping used for transferring HF to the process is a special thick walled corrosion resistant material.\n\nOperating Safely\n\n- A fire inside the HF cylinder cubicle is very improbable because no flammable material is stored in the area; therefore, overpressurization of a cylinder to dangerous levels is highly unlikely.\n\n- Only one full cylinder and one partially full cylinder of HF is normally allowed on-site.  There is no other on-site or off-site inventory of HF.  The HF cylinder is delivered by the vendor directly to the HF storage cubicle.\n\n- Leaks are easily detected visually and by smell.    \n\n- The HF transfer supply line between the HF cubicle and the production facilities is purged clear between additions of HF.  The HF addition step is a small component of the batch cycle.   \n\n- The HF addition is DCS controlled. \n\n- The HF addition is a low pressure addition which is well below the design criteria of the piping system.\n\n- Procedures require two operators to be present when connecting or disconnecting an HF cylinder.\n\n- DSC interlocks and ESD systems (both software and hardwired) are in place to ensure the safe handling and addition of HF and to safely terminate an HF addition should a release occur.\n\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work within the HF system are trained and qualified in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations. \n\n- Any changes to operating procedures or equipment are reviewed for potential impact on health, safety, and the environment using the Management of Change Process.\n\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n\n- Flex hose connectors to the process are routinely inspected to be in good condition as part of the operating procedure. \n\n- The HF cylinder/process piping connection and the HF reactor system are routinely pressure checked for leaks to ensure the integrity of the system. \n\n- HF detection systems are routinely calibrated.\n\n- The HF system is inspected on a routine basis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the piping, instrumentation, interlocks, and ESDs (as applicable).  Any discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n\n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is completed at least once every three years.\n\nAuditing Our Operations\n\n- HF cylinders undergo a safety inspection by the vendor on a routine schedule.  Discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use.\n\n- Audits are completed at least once every three years in accordance with PSM/RMP requirements.",

Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nBasic Information\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a clear, colorless gas with a sharp, intensely irritating odor.  The vapors are irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract.  Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite.  Long term exposure to low concentrations and short-term exposure to high concentrations can result in adverse health effects from inhalation.  Ammonia is soluble in water, forming a corrosive liquid.  Although ammonia is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak initially hug the ground.  In liquid form, it is lighter than water.  Ammonia accelerates the burning of combustible material and is corrosive to metals and tissue.\n\n\n\nUses\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a raw material in chemical manufacturing operations and as a source of nitrogen for wastewater treatment.\n\n\n\n2.    Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)\n\n\n\nBasic Information\n\nHydrogen Fluoride (HF) is a colorless fuming liquid, boiling at 67?F.  HF is shipped as a liquid confined under its own vapor pressure and is corrosive to metals and tissue.  Very short contact with fumes or small quantities of the liquid can cause severe, painful burns.  Vapors are heavier than air.  The liquid density is very close to that of water.  HF is completely miscible with water but yields significant heat of solution when mixed.\n\n\n\nUses\n\nHF is used as a catalyst and raw material in chemical manufacturing operations.\n\n\n\n3.    Phosphorous Oxychloride (POCl3)\n\n\n\nBasic Information\n\nPhosphorus oxychloride is a colorless to pale yellow fuming liquid with a pungent odor.  It is toxic by inhalation and ingestion and is strongly irritating to skin and tissues.  It causes burns to the mucous membranes of the mouth and digestive tract and may be fatal.  It reacts with water to form hydrochloric and phosphoric acids with evolution of heat.  It is corrosive to metals and tissue. \n\n\n\nUses\n\nPhosphorus oxychloride is used as a raw material in chemical manufactur"

Phosphorous Trichloride (PCl3)\n\n\n\nBasic Information\n\nPhosphorus trichloride is a colorless or slightly yellow fuming liquid with a pungent and irritating odor resembling hydrochloric or muriatic acid.  Long term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health effects by inhalation.  PCl3 is a strong reducing agent that may ignite combustible organic materials upon contact.  It reacts with water to form hydrochloric and phosphoric acids with evolution of heat.  It is corrosive to metals and tissue.\n\n\n\nUses\n\nPhosphorus trichloride is used as a raw material in chemical manufacturing operations.\n\n\n\n5.    Acetaldehyde\n\n\n\nBasic Information\n\nAcetaldehyde is a clear, colorless liquid with a pungent odor.  However, under normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, liquid acetaldehyde will rapidly evaporate into a gas.  Its vapors are irritating to the mucous membranes and especially the eyes.  If it becomes contaminated, it may either react with the contaminant or polymerize both with the evolution of heat.  It is lighter than water and soluble in water.  Its vapors are heavier than air.\n\n\n\nUses\n\nAcetaldehyde is a base ingredient used to produce other chemicals.  It eventually ends up in many products containing fibers and plastics.\n\n\n\n6.    Isobutylene\n\n\n\nBasic Information\n\nIsobutylene is a colorless gas with a faint, petroleum-like odor.  It is shipped as a liquefied gas under its own vapor pressure.  Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite.  Isobutylene is easily ignited; its vapors are heavier than air and a flame can flash back to the source of a leak very easily.  The leak can either be a liquid or vapor leak.  Vapor is irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat.  If inhaled, it can cause dizziness or loss of consciousness.  \n\n\n\nUses\n\nIsobutylene is used as a raw material in chemical manufacturing operations.\n\n\n\n7.
