The scenario involves the release of 600 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 60 minutes.   With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a 2000 lb. container. The scenario involves the release of 1680 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 1.4 minutes.   With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a 150 lb. cylinder.

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Kansas City FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances is Chlorine. The Chlorine is received in 90 ton railcar\u00bfs, 2000lbs. and 150lb containers .  Chlorine, is used only in a process to produce Sodium Hypochlorite and to resell 2000 lbs. and 150lb. containers to customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 540,000 lbs. in 90 ton railcars, 100,000 lbs. in 2000lb containers and 45,000 lbs in 150 lb. cylinders.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as RMP COMP VER. 1.06 for Chlorine.
