      "SummaryText": "Canyon Regional Water Authority's Wells Ranch Water Treatment Plant is located in Guadalupe County, Texas, in a rural area with a low population. Wells Ranch Water Treatment Plant is located approximately 12 miles south of the City of Seguin, Texas in a wooded area approximately 1.5 miles from highway FM 1117, and uses chlorine gas as the primary water disinfectant.\n\nThe chlorine supply will be gas liquified by pressure.  The supply on hand will be a maximum of twelve(10), one-ton cylinders for a total of 20,000 pounds.  A vacuum feed/injection system is used to prevent leaks in the system. A chlorine leak detector is in place with an audible alarm system to alert personnel of chlorine leaks. This alarm sends an alarm to an alerting system to notify operators of a chlorine leak. There are SCBA units on-site for chlorine emergencies. The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times a day by an on-site operators and monitored daily on weekends. Preventative maintenance is performed regularly.\n\nA Hazard Assessment has been conducted and documented in accordance with 40 CFR 68.20 - 68.42 and a Prevention Program has been implemented to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.48 \u00c2\u00bf 68.60. There have been no accidental chlorine gas releases within the past five years.\n\nCanyon Regional Water Authority has developed an emergency response plan for the Wells Ranch Water Treatment Plant. This plan identifies procedures and response actions to be taken in the event of an accidental release of chlorine. The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Guadalupe County EMC and the Sand Hills Volunteer Fire Department."
