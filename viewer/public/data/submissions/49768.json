All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.    Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThis facility is located in Farr West, UT.   Processed food is stored at this location.  Food ingredients are received, packaged, and shipped.  The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing.  Ammonia is the most effective, energy efficient and environmentally safe chemical for keeping food at its proper temperature.\n\n3.    Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nPlease refer to onsite data (Volume 1: Risk Management Plan) at Associated Food Stores.\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThis location complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and conforms to industry standards.  The system includes ammonia detection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located outside the main mechanical room, high- and low-level switches in pressure vessels, and safety relief valves piped into a diffusion system to avert ser"

Annual physical system audits are performed by an external refrigeration contractor to ensure system integrity. \n\n5.    Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years this facility has had no accidental release of ammonia.  \n\n6.    Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance. Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\nAssociated Food Stores expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of their PSM/RMP Program.\n\nAll recommendations developed during the PHA were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.  Associated Food Stores expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
