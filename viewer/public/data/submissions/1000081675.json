Facility Policy.\n\n\n\n        The owners, management and employees of Rock River Lumber & Grain Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,  Whiteside Emergency Management/County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information.\n\n\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to area farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  At times, Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on site in nurse tanks designed for this purpose.  The facility is manned year round during normal business hours.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario \n\n\n\n         An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\n\n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL "

Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n\n\n        Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions at our facility.   There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time.\n\n"
