No incidents resulted in significant company property damage, employee injury or off-site impact to people, property or the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for  emergency response planning. The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the employees, the public and the environment during emergency conditions. The plan is available to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Federal authorities, Florida Division of Emergency Management, City of Jacksonville and to local responders for coordination with the community emergency plans.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe facility has a systematic program for reviewing process hazards and as improvements are identified as worthwhile, they will be implemented.  All employees actively participate in the identification of potential safety issues and opportunities for improvement.  Observations, recommendations and concerns submitted by employees are tracked and addressed as part of a continuous improvement system.\r\n\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATION\r\n\r\nTo the best of the my knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted in this Risk Management Plan is true, accurate, and complete.\r\n\r\nCertifying Official:  Brenda S.

The worst-case scenario was developed in accordance with stipulations of the RMP (EPA) regulation; Symrise considers the worst-case scenario and the predicted consequences to be extremely unlikely.  The alternate scenario presented is also very unlikely but predicts impacts for a loss of hazardous material containment with mitigating equipment and procedures activated.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help the facility to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains several programs and practices designed to minimize the possibility of accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place include:\r\n\r\nIntegrated Contingency Plan, which includes the company emergency plan \r\nInspections, Testing and Preventative Maintenance\r\nIncident Investigations\r\nEmployee Training and Process Operating Procedures\r\nHazardous Work Permit Procedures\r\nFormal Process Hazard Analysis \r\nManagement of Change and Pre-Start-up Safety Reviews\r\nContractor Safety Program\r\nProcess Design Following Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices\r\n\r\nSpecific additional methods employed to prevent accidental release of hydrogen chloride include leak detection sensors and alarms in the processing and storage areas, automation and process interlocks, water spray nozzles at the connection between the process piping and bulk storage, automatic shutdown of the hydrogen chloride supply upon process upset or leak detection, flow-limiting valve to limit and minimize gas flow out of bulk storage, and a caustic scrubber to neutralize any vapors from the process equipment.\r\n\r\nSpecific additional meth"
