The accidental release prevention and emergency policies at the facility:\r\n\r\nThe Nachurs Alpine Solutions (Nachurs) facility located at 421 Leader Street, Marion, Marion County County, Ohio complies with applicable requirements for ammonia storage, and it is Nachurs' policy to adhere to all apllicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an accidental release were to occur involving the ammonia storage system, Nachurs would immediately notify the Marion Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  Nachurs has a Chemical Evacuation Plan which would be followed.  This Plan provides for sheltering in place or evacuation as directed by the scene commander.  Employees are assigned to evacuation groups and the group leaders are equipped with radios to maintain communication.\r\n\r\n2.  A description of the facility and regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe Nachurs facility produces plant food for commercial and private use.  The plant food product is produced by mixing several chemicals in a reactor, including ammonia.  The ammonia storage process consists of two above ground storage tanks and associated piping, valves, pumps and other miscellaneous equipment.  \r\n\r\n3.  The general accidential release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe Nachurs facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with applicable state law using materials approved for use with aqua ammonia.  As an administrative control, tanks are only filled to 90% of capacity.  The ammonia storage tanks are located within 8' high dike walls.  The floor of the dike drains to a sump which collects and pumps any released ammonia into a 30,000 gallon spill collection storage tank.  The aqua system is visually inspected daily, it is fully inspected annually by the Maintenance Department and it is inspected every five years by a tank inspection e"

      "SummaryText": "ntity.  The thicknesses of the tanks are measured every five years by a tank inspection entity.  Unloading of ammonia is performed on loading pads with a 6\" berm surrounding the pad.  Tankers being unloaded are equipped with an emergency shut-off valve.  The facility has an emergency shutdown system which stops all operations except the spill collection recovery system.  Employees are trained in the proper procedures for storing and handling aqua ammonia.  Nachurs conducts emergency drills with the Marion Fire Department and the Marion County LEPC.\r\n\r\n4.  Five-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThe Nachurs facility has never had an accidental release from the ammonia storage system resulting in deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  \r\n\r\n5.  The emergency response program:\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving the ammonia storage system, it is Nachurs' policy to immediately notify the Marion Fire Department who would respond to the emergency.  The Marion Fire Department is aware of this policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nNachurs feels that its system and procedures are appropriate for handling and storing aqua ammonia, and there are no improvements to safety needed at the current time."
