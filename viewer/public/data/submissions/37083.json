We meet or exceedn all federal, state and local standards in the operation of our plant.  Our core purpose is to be the supplier of choice for customers worldwide.  Our stakeholders produce value added egg products utilizing liquid egg in either whole, white or yolk form.  We carry a fulline of liquid egg products, diced egg and entree products.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used in our refrigeration system to maintain and control temperatures of our manufacturing process.  This ensures that our products are processed and maintained at proper temperatures to inhibit microbiological growth.   We have Emergency Response Teams on sight that train and drill on a regular basis.  The local fire department tours on a regular basis and reviews our systems for emergency response.  We also review with the fire dept. the key points to know about our refrigeration system.  Evacuation drills are held on a regular basis with all stakeholders.  We conduct regular PM's that are tracked on a computer maintenance management system.  This is allowing us to build history in an organized manner that will allow us to become predictive in our maintenance vs.preventive.  Management of Change is a central part of our Process Safety Management and is adhered to.  Contractors are required to submit information on their safety programs and an approval is granted.  Before work is started all contractors complete an orientation to ensure understanding of Sunny Fresh Safety policies/rules and permit procedures.  We prevent accidents by designing for safety, maintaining our plant, operating safely, auditing and training of stakeholders."
