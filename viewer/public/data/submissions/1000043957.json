The Corporate Compliance Team assists the facility in administering safety and environmental policies. The Corporate Compliance Team is made up of the following personnel:\n\n\n\n?    Senior Director of Corporate Refrigeration\n\n?    Corporate Manager of Refrigeration\n\n?    Senior Manager Environmental Compliance\n\n?    PSM-RMP Regulatory Manager\n\n?    Corporate Manager of Facilities Compliance\n\n?    OSHA Regulatory Manager\n\n\n\nThe Maintenance Manager periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\n\n\nThe primary business of C&S - Baldwin is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 37,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.\n\n\n\nThe Baldwin facility is located at 15500 Beaver Street West in Jacksonville, Florida.  The facility consists of areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution.\n\nThe C&S - Baldwin facility has an ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity. The ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in the compressor room.  The compressor room is where the high pressure receiver (HPR) or storage tank is located inside the warehouse building. The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration syste"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S - Baldwin to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S - Baldwin's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in"

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of a low-level ammonia detection and cease operation of the refrigeration system in the event of a high-level detection.  There are also ammonia detectors located throughout the freezer warehouse that will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection in those locations.  An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the Maintenance Manager and Refrigeration Technicians.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (June 2009 - June 2014). There have been no releases of ammonia resulting in injuries at the facility either.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n- save lives;\n\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n- protect the environment; and\n\n- minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and is developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the local Fire Department. The City of Jacksonville's Hazardous Materials Response Team would coordinate and/or assist if an incident were to occur.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at 1-(800) 832-8224.\n\n\n\nThere is a specific Corporate C&S program (CEHS-0042) which outlines the training, qualifications and procedures for authorized ammonia Incident responders and observers.
