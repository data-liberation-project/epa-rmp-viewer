      "SummaryText": "Sacramento Logistics LLC, located at 3771 Channel Drive in West Sacramento operates under SIC code number 5141 as a wholesale food distribution warehouse. Sacramento Logistics LLC was formerly Fleming Foods Northern California Product Supply Center. The Fleming Facility was purchased in 2003 by C&S Wholesale Foods, located at 7 Corporate Drive in Keene, New Hampshire and renamed, Sacramento Logistics LLC. Operation consists of storage, loading, and unloading of trucks containing dry and refrigerated grocery products. Ammonia is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing of food products prior to distribution to various retail outlets. The refrigeration system underwent a major upgrade in 1994, which increased the total system ammonia volume to approximately 11,300 pounds.   This exceeds U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity (TQ) for preparing an RMP.  Because the facility's utilization of this quantity of ammonia also exceeds the TQ established by U.S. OSHA for preparing a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan (completed for the facility in March 1996 and revised in June 1999), the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulations.  \n\nSeveral safety devices are installed on the ammonia refrigeration system.  A seismic detection system was installed that will automatically close all control valves and electrical outputs in the event of an earthquake.  A total of 16 ammonia detectors are located in refrigerated and mechanical rooms throughout the facility.  These detectors are connected to a control system that will either sound an alarm to facility maintenance personnel in the event of a low-level detection, between 100 and 400 parts-per-million (ppm), or will automatically shut down the system, notify the fire department, close motorized butterfly valves to isolate pressure vessels, and sound an alarm in the mechanical room and guard house in the event that greater than 400 ppm of ammonia is detected.

In the event of an emergency that may affect the refrigeration system, an ammonia dump system is installed which will safely reduce refrigeration system pressure by discharging ammonia from each pressure vessel in the system and routing it through a diffuser that dilutes the ammonia with water and discharges the mixture into a 25,000 gallon underground retention tank.\n\nThe principal element of the Program 3 RMP is the Offsite Consequence Analysis.  This involves developing and modeling one worst-case and one alternative theoretical release scenario to estimate the impact an accidental release may have on the public in the surrounding area.  The worst-case release assumes that the entire ammonia charge is released into the atmosphere during pessimistic meteorological conditions.  This scenario is intended as a basis of comparison with other facilities, but it is not realistic to expect such a scenario to actually occur.  The requirements for the alternative release include that it be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and that it be substantial enough to reach offsite.  The alternative release scenario assumes average daily atmospheric conditions for the area, which were mandated by the local Administering Agency (AA).  \n\nAll release scenarios were modeled using the air dispersion model Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) version 5.2.3.  Because ammonia can exist in both neutrally bouyant and heavy gas states under the conditions examined, both the Gaussian and heavy gas Algorithms were used.  The more conservative of the two toxic endpoint calculations were used for assessing each release scenario's impact.  The toxic endpoint is given as 0.14 milligrams-per-liter by the"

This release's endpoint extends 0.17 miles from the facility.  Because the area immediately surrounding the facility is strictly industrial, there are no residents or environmental receptors within this radius, nor does it encompass any waterways.\n\nThe Sacramento Logistics facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within the past five years.\n\nThe prevention program requirements for Program 3 RMPs are taken verbatim from applicable sections of the PSM regulations.  This is a result of U.S. EPA's recognition that measures taken to reduce and mitigate hazards to facility workers will also serve the same purpose for the surrounding community and environment.  Thus, in order to eliminate redundancy, the PSM is referenced in the RMP.  The PSM consists of several elements that contain or describe procedures that must be implemented on an ongoing basis, including ammonia and process safety information,  process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training, contractor qualification, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity of equipment, management of change, incident investigation, and injury and illness prevention. \n\nThe intent of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to compile system information for use in conducting the Process Hazard Analysis and to help facility operators to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.   PSI must include information on the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used in the process, information on the technology of the process, and information on the equipment in the process.

It should also be made available to all employees and be included, as necessary, in employee training programs.\n\nThe PSI for the facility includes physical chemical properties of ammonia, ammonia toxicity information, information regarding the refrigeration system design and operation, and equipment standards and chemical usage.  Previously, Fleming developed an ammonia information notebook that contains essential information about ammonia and the refrigeration system in an easy-to-understand format appropriate for facility visitors, contractors, and personnel not involved with operating the refrigeration system. \n\nThe purpose of the operating procedures portion of the PSM program is to develop, implement, and maintain clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules and practices for the safe operation of the refrigeration process during all operating phases.  A copy of the operating procedures must be readily accessible to all employees who work on or near the refrigeration system.  All employees involved in the daily operation and maintenance of the refrigeration process should have a full understanding of every operating phase.  This is to include an overview of the process, principles of using ammonia in refrigeration systems, operating characteristics of the components of the system and the associated safety hazards, and the proper steps to be taken to execute all system-related tasks in a safe manner.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed that include all pertinent procedures involved with the refrigeration system, including those mandated by the PSM regulation.  A certification form is also provided in the PSM for annual review of all SOPs.\n\nAll employees involved with the refrigeration system must understand the safety and health hazards associated with the use of ammonia in the process.

The mechanical integrity program helps ensure that proper procedures are adequate and are being followed, such that all equipment used to process, store and handle ammonia is maintained properly.  The mechanical integrity program includes an inventory of all refrigeration system equipment, including the date on which it was installed and its life expectancy, a list of scheduled maintenance tasks and inspections and a description of the preventative maintenance program for process equipment. \n\nA PSM compliance audit must be completed at least every three years.  The principal objective of the audit is determine whether the procedures and practices that have been developed to comply with the PSM regulation are adequate and are being followed.  The audit is to include an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the PSM program and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that the PSM elements are effectively implemented.

This program includes the identity of employees to be trained, the training program technical content, competency requirements, documentation requirements for demonstration of competence, schedule for initial training and refresher training, and training for change.  In addition, contract and maintenance personnel also receive training as provided for in the Contractor Qualification Program.  The PSM includes a form for documenting all training provided to employees.\nThe purpose of the Contractor Qualification Program is to help ensure that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved in the use of ammonia and the refrigeration system.  This awareness should lead to reduced risk of accidents, and thus improved safety for both contractor employees and the company's employees.  It applies to all contractors performing any type of work (e.g. maintenance, renovation) on or in the vicinity of the refrigeration system.  The Contractor Qualification Program consists of a five part procedure to be used during the procurement of a contractor in order to verify that their employees are adequately informed and trained, and includes several forms to facilitate and document the process.  \n\nThe purpose for the pre-startup safety review is to help ensure that certain important considerations have been addressed prior to startup of a new or modified process involving ammonia.

In order to facilitate necessary changes, while ensuring that unrecognized and/or unacceptable hazards are not introduced, the management of change (MOC) procedure has been developed.  The objective of the MOC procedure is to help ensure that all changes are properly reviewed, and that any hazards introduced by the implementation of the change are identified and controlled, prior to placing the change in operation.  The MOC procedure is intended to apply to all equipment and procedures involving the refrigeration system, and to any change in procedures regardless of whether the change is considered major or minor, or is of a temporary or permanent nature.  As part of the PSM, definitions, procedures, and documentation forms were developed to accomplish the MOC.\n\nA procedure has been developed to investigate serious incidents or near-misses in order to understand what happened (or could have happened) and to prevent any recurrence of similar incidents, thereby improving the safety of the process.  Formal incident investigations will be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in (near-miss), a catastrophic release of ammonia.

In the event of an emergency that may affect the refrigeration system, an ammonia dump system is installed which will safely reduce refrigeration system pressure by discharging ammonia from each pressure vessel in the system and routing it through a diffuser that dilutes the ammonia with water and discharges the mixture into a 25,000 gallon underground retention tank.\r\n\r\nThe principal element of the Program 3 RMP is the Offsite Consequence Analysis.

The worst-case release assumes that the entire ammonia charge is released into the atmosphere during pessimistic meteorological conditions.  This scenario is intended as a basis of comparison with other facilities, but it is not realistic to expect such a scenario to actually occur.  The requirements for the alternative release include that it be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and that it be substantial enough to reach offsite.  The alternative release scenario assumes average daily atmospheric conditions for the area, which were mandated by the local Administering Agency (AA).  \r\n\r\nAll release scenarios were modeled using the air dispersion model Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) version 5.2.3.  Because ammonia can exist in both neutrally bouyant and heavy gas states under the conditions examined, both the Gaussian and heavy gas Algorithms were used.  The more conservative of the two toxic endpoint calculations were used for assessing each release scenario's impact.  The toxic endpoint is given as 0.14 milligrams-per-liter by the American Industrial Hygiene Association's Emergency Response Planning Guidelines for Level 2. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario incorporated passive mitigation provided by the enclosure of the refrigeration mechanical room, which would facilitate the impingement of released ammonia causing liquid rainout, and reducing the release rate of ammonia vapor.  Therefore, the total amount of ammonia released over 10 minutes would be 11,300 pounds, but the release rate to the atmosphere is 452 pounds/per minute over the 10 minutes.

Thus, in order to eliminate redundancy, the PSM is referenced in the RMP.  The PSM consists of several elements that contain or describe procedures that must be implemented on an ongoing basis, including ammonia and process safety information,  process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training, contractor qualification, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity of equipment, management of change, incident investigation, and injury and illness prevention. \r\n\r\nThe intent of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to compile system information for use in conducting the Process Hazard Analysis and to help facility operators to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.   PSI must include information on the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used in the process, information on the technology of the process, and information on the equipment in the process.  This information must be kept up-to-date as process changes or upgrades are made.  It should also be made available to all employees and be included, as necessary, in employee training programs.\r\n\r\nThe PSI for the facility includes physical chemical properties of ammonia, ammonia toxicity information, information regarding the refrigeration system design and operation, and equipment standards and chemical usage.
