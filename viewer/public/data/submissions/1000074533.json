      "SummaryText": "Clarksburg Wastewater Treatment Plan     Risk management Plan Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Clarksburg Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection purposes and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of treated wastewater prior to discharge to the West Fork River. The facility utilizes one ton cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide which are received at the facility on an as needed bases. Chlorine is ordered six (6) tons at a time. Sulfur dioxide is ordered two (2) tons at a time when the inventory in the cylinder on line is below one thousand (1,000) pounds as to not exceed the threshold limit of five thousand (5,000) pounds. Up to nine (9) cylinders of chlorine and under two and one half (2 1/2) cylinders of sulfur dioxide are maintained on-site at any one time. All cylinders are stored inside the wastewater treatment plant at the chlorine and sulfur dioxide buildings. The chlorine system has two (2) banks of three (3) cylinders connected at any time and utilizes an automatic switchover system that switches to a full bank of three (3) cylinders once the three (3) feeding become empty. The sulfur system has two (2) cylinders connected at one time feeding from one (1) cylinder at a time. Once the cylinder feeding becomes empty, the second cylinder is manually put on-line. The average chlorine usage rate is approximately two hundred fifty (250) pounds per day with a maximum feed rate of six hundred (600) pounds per day. The average sulfur dioxide feed rate is approximately eighty (80) pound per day with a maximum feed rate of one hundred fifty (150) pounds per day. Tha facility utilizes Wallace and Tiernan chlorinator and sulfonator systems. The systems operate such that the chlorine and sulfur dioxide transfer from the cylinders to the chlorinators and sulfonators is under vacuum versus pressure. This type of arrangement provides for minimal potential for leaks of chlorine gas through the piping. The facility has a preventative maintenance program which"

A maintenance program is utilized which generates work orders to perform maintenance on a routine basis. The physical state of both chemicals discharged from the one ton cylinders is gas versus liquid which is controlled by the connection to the one ton cylinders. Cylinders are received from the vendor and the transfer of the cylinders from the truck to the appropriate storage area is always performed during daylight hours and is attended by the truck driver and at least two (2) treatment plant operators. The facility is not continuously manned but all alarks are monitored by a SCADA control system which alerts off-site personnel to alarm conditions for immediate response. There are two (2) chlorine sensors located at the facility. One monitors the air in the chlorine cylinder storage area and one monitors the air in the chlorinator room for chlorine releases. Both rooms are equiped with positive ventilation and exhaust fans which are designed to come on by manually starting them from outside the rooms via a control panel or they will automatically start when the entrance door is physically opened. There are also two (2) sulfur dioxide sensors at the facility. One monitors the air in the sulfur dioxide storage area and one monitors the air in the sulfonator room for sulfur dioxide releases. Both the sulfur dioxide storage room and sulfonator room are equiped with exhaust fans which are designed to come on by manually starting them from outside the rooms via a control panel or they will automatically start when the entrance door is physically opened. Both the chlorine building and the sulfur dioxide building have a combination bell and flashing light on the outside of the buildings which are energized when an alarm condition exists.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenerio identified for this facility would be for the breaking off of a valve or the melting of a plug causin"

The Clarksburg Fire Department personnel can respond within five (5) minutes and have the adequate personal protective equipment to address the emergency. Emergency repair kits for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are on site for use if necessary. Regarding lower volumn releases, the Clarksburg employees associated with handliong the hazardous materials through operations, are trained on the proper response to non-incidental releases. The chemical supplier also has a emergency number posted on site to call for an emergency and can be on-site within 2 hours of notification. Once the chlorine and sulfur dioxide usage areas have been adequately ventilated and the release of gas stopped, treatment plant personnel will enter into the area to perform the repair work necessary. Personnel are instructed to never enter the chlorine or sulfur dioxide usage areas in the event of an alarm situation. Should community evacuation or shelter in place become necessary, the CWWTP will utilize the Harrison County Office of Emergency services to coordinate the evacuation/shelter in place activity.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nThe CWWTP employees receive annual chlorine and sulfur dioxide awareness training from the chemical supplier. Operating and maintenance personnel are trained and tested for competency in the operational procedures for working with chlorine/sulfur dioxide and the safe handling/moving of cylinders. They are also trained in the proper procedures to follow in the event of a release and the evacuation of the facility.
