      "SummaryText": "The Northern California Power Agency Combustion Turbine Project No. 2 is a 49.9 megawatt facility producing power for the local electrical grid. Ammonia is used to control emissions from the power generation process. The California Accidental Release Prevention Plan (RMPP) and the new Federal Risk Management Pland (RMP) promulgated pursuant to Section 112r of the1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The California Office of Emergency Services (OES) oversees the CalARP regulations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has delegated implementation authority for the Federal progream to OES. At the local level, the pogram is implemented by the Certified Unified Permitting Agency (CUPA). For facilities operating with the City of Lodi, the CUPA is the County of San Joaquin Office of Emergency Services. Because the CalARP program is a combination of the Federal and State requirements,  the program includes two lists of regulated toxic and flammable substances. Whie many of the chemicals are present on both listes, the state applicability thresholds are generally lower. The Federal threshold quantity for anhdrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds and the State threshold quantity is 500 pounds. The RMP must be developed from a comprehensive assessment of the processes, operations and procedures at the faciliyt, and includes four main elements; A management system that specifies qualified and responsible persons; A hazard assessment that analyzes and documents potential environmenal and population receptors due to an accidental release; A prevention program that compiles operational procedures, safety information and specific hazard information into a program that minimizes the threat of an accidental release; and An emergency response program that established procedures to dal with the results of an accidental release. Also addressed in this document are requirements of  Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 355. The requirements of this section apply to any facility at wh"

      "SummaryText": "ich an extremely hazardous chemical is present at or above the thresold planning quantity. The threshold planning quantity is the amount of a chemical above which the facility is required to notify the local emergency planning committee or emergency response personnel of the cheimcals present, to provide a facility emergency response coordinator and to notify the committee of any changes that occur. Any facility that produces, uses or stores hazardous chemicals above the threshold planning quantity is required to notify specific agencies in the event of a release. The reportable quantity is the amount of chemical that, when released, requires notification of designated agencies. Ammonia, a hazardous chemical located at the Northern California Power Agency Combustion Turbine Projec No. 2 has a threshold planning quantity of 500 pounds. The reportable quantity for ammonia is 100 pounds. The format for this document is taken from the Guidance Document for the California Consolidated Contingency Planj published by the Governor's Office of Emergency Services and is modeled after the National Response Team's Integrated Plant, the One Plant."
