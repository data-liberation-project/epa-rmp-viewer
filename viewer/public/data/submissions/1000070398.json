Prevention of workplace incidents, injuries, and illnesses is vital for the well-being of people in and around our sites and for the success of Eastman.  At the Texas City Operations site (\"TCO Plant\"), we believe all incidents, injuries and illnesses are preventable, and we place strong emphasis on six basic safety expectations which are applicable both on and off the job: \n\n\n\n1.)    Follow procedures and safety rules\n\n2.)    Take time to do the job safely\n\n3.)    Identify and eliminate hazards\n\n4.)    Watch out for co-workers\n\n5.)    Report all job-related injuries or illnesses\n\n6.)    Use appropriate personal protective equipment\n\n\n\nEastman also believes adherence to the following nine principles are vital to maintaining a safe workplace:\n\n\n\nManagement Leadership & Accountability - Each Manager establishes clear safety expectations and goals, provides resources, establishes processes, and monitors overall progress.  \n\n\n\nEmployee Involvement - Each employee is committed to working safely and to protecting the safety of others.  Employees participate fully in all elements of the safety program.\n\n\n\nRegulatory Compliance - Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is an integral part of Eastman's safety program.  \n\n\n\nInclusive Scope - Prevention of workplace incidents, injuries, and illnesses for employees, contractors, visitors, suppliers, and customers is our safety objective.  Providing the skills and attitude to work safely off the job is our expanded goal.\n\n\n\nIncident Prevention - Work-related incidents are prevented through several layers of protection, including safe design, safe work practices, safe behaviors, and the use of appropriate engineering, operating, and administrative controls.  \n\n\n\nSafety Education - Each employee is provided with the knowledge and s"

It also maintains terminal operations for methanol, 2-ethylhexanol, and triethyl phosphate at its facility.\n\n\n\nThe TCO Plant covers approximately 290 acres within the Texas City Industrial Complex, and is located at 201 Bay Street South in Texas City, Texas, Galveston County.   It has marine facilities for receiving ships and barges, facilities for delivery and shipment of chemicals by rail and truck, and a network of pipelines supplying necessary feedstocks.\n\n\n\nThere are 128 Eastman employees at the TCO Plant, and the hourly employees are represented by the Texas City, Texas Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO.  There may be approximately 300 total workers in the plant at any one time during labor-intensive activities such as turnarounds. \n\n\n\nEastman presently does not store or handle any flammable substances identified by the RMP regulation.  It does, however, store and handle one toxic chemical (chlorine) in a quantity greater than the threshold quantity specified by the RMP regulation.  Chlorine is used for water treatment at Eastman and is delivered by a specially-equipped truck designed to transport one-ton chlorine containers.  Two (2) one-ton containers may be in use at the TCO Plant at any one time for the purification of water.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThrough its Management of Change (MOC) s"

This system helps prevent or minimize the potential consequences associated with a catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals at the TCO Plant.\n\n\n\nEastman's MOC system includes the conducting of Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) for new facilities and for modified facilities in accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  These PSSRs are conducted to verify appropriate safety information has been updated, required reviews have been performed, and necessary training has been completed.\n\n\n\nAn important part of Eastman's accidental release prevention program is its Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program.  A PHA is a study which is conducted by a multi-discipline team of employees to determine the ways in which a chemical process may deviate from the design intent.  The PHA Team consists of well-trained personnel knowledgeable in the technology and operations of the particular unit or process under study.  The PHA Teams make recommendations concerning any issues which they feel warrant some follow-up discussion or action, and Management assigns responsibility to each recommendation.  These recommendations are then tracked to completion based on documented responses from the responsible individuals.  A PHA is revalidated at least every five years to ensure it is consistent with the current process.  The chlorine system has had five PHAs conducted on it so far, and all recommendations resulting from these PHAs have been addressed.\n\n\n\nThere are written procedures for the receipt, connection, disconnection, and switching of chlorine containers, as well as for the normal operation of the chlorination system.  Included in these procedures are requirements to conduct leak checks during the initial connection of a chlorine container to the piping system, and also during each "

Eastman also has procedures to address inclement weather which may affect process operations at the TCO Plant, such as a hurricane or freezing temperatures.\n\n\n\nThe TCO Plant has an \"Emergency Response Plan\" which establishes responsibilities and requirements for responding to emergencies that might occur at the site.  Each manufacturing department also has emergency operating procedures for the safe operation and/or shutdown of plant operations during an emergency.  Together, and with the use of an Incident Command System (ICS) modeled after the National Incident Management System (NIMS) framework, Eastman provides a systematic and proactive approach to respond to incidents in a manner which reduces injuries, community impact, property damage, and harm to the environment.\n\n\n\nThe Incident Command System is the organization of employees who responds to an emergency in various support roles, such as the Incident Commander, Officers, firefighters, medical responders, and Emergency Communications Coordinator.  \n\n\n\nEastman also is a member of the Texas City Industrial Mutual Aid System (IMAS), which coordinates mutual response activities between the local industrial community and the City of Texas City.  \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Communications Coordinator supports the Incident Commander (IC) by coordinating notifications and communications between the IC, Management, and internal and ext"

Firefighters receive \"Live Industrial Rescue and Firefighting\" training from Texas A&M, HAZWOPER Technician Level training, and training on confined space rescues.  Officers receive additional training.  \n\n\n\nMembers of the Eastman Medical and Response Team have been trained extensively in the assessment and treatment of injuries and illnesses.  Many are licensed as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT).\n\n\n\nEastman conducts numerous drills each year on the elements of its emergency response plan to ensure everyone understands his or her role and responsibilities.  Such drills include confined space rescue, fire truck exercises, medical scenarios, tabletop scenarios, and personal protective equipment inspection and donning exercises.  One drill addresses a scenario of chlorine being released from a one-ton chlorine container.  A major drill is also conducted with the other members of the IMAS organization.\n\n\n\nFollowing each drill, members of the Emergency Response Team and other personnel perform a critique to evaluate the effectiveness of the emergency response plan and activities associated with it.  Critiques also are performed after actual incidents.\n\n\n\nMembers of the Emergency Response Team and the Health, Safety, Environmental, and Security (HSES) Department are responsible for the maintenance of equipment and fire protection systems used to respond to a fire or chemical release.  This includes vehicles, fixed fire protection systems, portable fire protection systems, and personal protective equipment.\n\n\n\nThe employee alarm system is described in the Emergency Response Plan, and it is also described in the Eastman Texas City Site-Specific training which all Eastman employees and Contractors must receive annually.
