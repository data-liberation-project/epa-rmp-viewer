Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2)  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3)  The worse case release scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario: Analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.   \n\n4)  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form: see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5)  The Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the past five yrars that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6)  The Emergency Response P"

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\n7)  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance fo safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
