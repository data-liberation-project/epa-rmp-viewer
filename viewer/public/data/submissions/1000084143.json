The Beaver Street facility has over a threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated highly hazardous chemical per EPA's 40 CFR-68.  Beaver Street has a unified Risk Management Program as well as OSHA Process Safety Management program that are presented in this summary.\n\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (a)\n\nBeaver Street Fisheries, Inc. accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program.  It also complies with the like requirements of 29-CFR 1910.119 OSHA PSM program.\n\n1.1.1.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (a) (1)\n\n    Beaver Street has a management system in place which is lead by the Fisheries' Vice President, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other facility-specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of an ammonia release at the facility.  An organization chart defines the lines of authority and list responsible staff.  It is included in the plant's Process Safety Information.\n\n1.1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (a) (2)\n\nBeaver Street Fisheries, Inc. maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus OSHA elements needed to implement the program.  These are maintained in the Beaver Street plant Document Management System (DMS).  The unified PSM/RMP program was implemented in 2004 prior to increasing the maximum inventory above the 10,000 pound threshold.

The site is located at 1741 West Beaver Street, City of Jacksonville, in Duval County, Florida.  The site is bordered by Robinson Avenue on the west, railroad tracks on the east, McQuade Street on the north and West Beaver Street on the south.\n\n    The Plant includes an ammonia storage compressor and transfer system in its Engine Room.  There is an adjacent Control Room system.  The boundaries of the ammonia system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Ammonia Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent makeup and exhaust systems.  Ammonia liquid is delivered to numerous evaporators (refrigerator units located throughout the plant) and the warm gas returns to the Engine Room and it is liquefied in the rooftop condensers for further use.  These are detailed in the Piping and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  \n\n1.1.4.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\n\n    Anhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule 10,000 pound, as well as the like OSHA PSM threshold quantity.  Beaver Street's ammonia process was installed as part of the process of supplying plant refrigeration.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The ammonia is stored in a receiver and distributed to the refrigerator process control systems. \n\n    Anhydrous ammonia is a toxic chemical; it is an irritant and is corrosive.  Ammonia's formula is NH3.  The OSHA PEL is 50 ppm.  It is flammable and is a gas at standard conditions.  Ammonia is liquefied by compression.\n\n1.2.    WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (c)\n\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two ammonia release scenarios.  The first is a Worst Case Release Scenario.  The second is more probable Alternative Release Scenario.  Results are depicted on an aeria"

The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using RMP Comp to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\"  The EPA specified endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/l. This endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined based on the 2010 census.  The potential affected population and environmental receptors are identified.\n\n1.2.1.    WORST CASE (c) (1)\n\n    The results of the Worst Case Release Scenario are discussed in detail in the plant RMP program Process Safety Information.

The Engine Room houses a two stage refrigeration system which feeds both freezers and coolers, the cool doc and production areas.  The low temperature system pumps liquid ammonia from the low temp tank to the evaporators (freezers).  Ammonia vaporizes and then flows back to the low temp tank.  Vapor from the tank feeds vapor to the low side compressors.  The output of those compressors supplies the high temp tank.  Ammonia vapors from the high temp tank feed the high side compressors.  The compressor discharge at 145 psig vapor flows to the condensers located on the roof.  They cool and condense the high temperature vapors back to a liquid.  The liquid then flows into the high pressure liquid receiver.  Liquid ammonia under a pressure of 145 psig flows into the high temp evaporators (refrigeration s"

The plant and support equipment of the ammonia compressor room and control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  \n\n1.3.2.3.    Equipment Design\n\nThe process is built to and meets or exceeds good engineering requirements for an ammonia refrigeration system. These materials of construction are steel or ammonia compatible metallic and non-metallic compounds (not corroded by ammonia).  The ammonia pipe system is designed using schedule 80 seamless pipe designed to 2,500 psig.  The typical high pressure of the ammonia system is 145 psig giving a large safety factor.  \n\nThe Engine Room has a ventilation system, as well as an eye wash safety shower.  Relief valves are installed on the tanks and compressors. The relief valves all vent to a single stack outside and high above the Engine Room as ammonia is buoyant.  There are ammonia monitors in the Engine Room which detect the presence of ammonia.  The monitor system sounds an alarm and turns on a warning light in the Engine Room and adjacent control room/office.  \n\n1.4.    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (e)\n\nThere have been zero EPA recorded accidents in the past five years.  \n\n1.5.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (f)\n\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the Plant Emergency Response Policy and coordinated with the City of Jacksonville (Emergency Response Plan) and the LEPC.  The plan includes an emergency response \"decision tree\" and a notification plan.  The plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency response drills and drill evacuations are conducted.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.\n\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the Plant Wide Safety Committee, the Jacksonville Fire Department who staffs the nearby City Fi"

The key safety action items included resubmission of the RMP*eSubmit to the EPA, per Section 1.6 of this report, and this submission meets this recommendation.\n\nBeaver Street Fisheries, Inc. continually reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, Beaver Street management team and Process Safety Team are reviewing potential improvements to the existing design of the ammonia operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of ammonia.\n\n\n\n"
