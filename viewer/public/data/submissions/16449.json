      "SummaryText": "1.  Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.  Fort Monroe is commited to being a safe neighbor and employer.  Prevention of accidents, employee safety, and emergency response are all operations which have command support and visibilty.  Fort Monroe follows applicable regulations, requirements, and policies designed to provide a safe work environment.\n\n2.  Primary Activities.  Big Bethel WTP is owned and operated by Fort Monroe.  The plant was constructed in 1919 and expanded in  1938. The plant operates under a Waterworks Operation Permit No. 3650150 with a maximum design capacity of four (4) million gallons per day (MGD). The average operating capacity is approximately 3 MGD.  The plant supplies treated water to Langley Air Force Base (LAFB), Fort Monroe, and Bethel Manor Housing.  Approximately 80 - 85 percent of the water supplied goes to LAFB.  The raw water supply is obtained from the Big Bethel Reservoir with a capacity of approximately 392 million gallons in the Upper Reservoir and 214 million gallons in the Lower Reservoir.\n\n3.  Chlorination Process.  Chlorine is fed to pre-chlorinate and post-chlorinate raw water from the Resevoir.  The chlorination system is housed in a separate, detached concrete building.  Compressed, liquified chlorine is stored and fed from four (4) one-ton containers.  Only two (2) containers are on-line at one time (one active and one on backup).  The chlorine feeders have a rated capacity of 400 pounds per day (lb/d) that transports the vaporized chlorine under a vacuum to disinfect the raw water supply. The gas is precisely measured to mix with water to be fed in solution to the raw and filtered water injection points.  Additional information on the chlorination system is provided in Scetion 7, Prevention Program.\n \n4.  Reason Process is Covered.  The process is covered because of the quantity of chlorine which is potentially present onsite.\n\n5.  Quantity of Chemical.  Maximum potential quantity of chlorine at the WTP is 8,000 p"

      "SummaryText": "ounds.  During the site visit there were four one-ton chlorine containers onsite.\n\n6.  Program Level Of Chemical and Reason.  Chlorine will be treated as a Program Level 3 substance.  The WTP operation is subject to OSHA PSM and the off-site consequence analysis does show a potential impact to the public under the required conditions of a worst-case release.\n\n7.  Use of Chemical.  Chlorine is used to disinfect installation potable water.\n\n8.  Use of Product and Product Turnaround.  A one-ton container (2,000 pounds) is used every 25 to 30 days.\n\n9.  How Chemical is Stored, and in What Quantity.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton containers.  A maximum of four one-ton containers are stored onsite at any given time.\n\n10.  Description of Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative-Release Scenario(s).  The worst-case release scenario for chlorine involves the EPA recommended parameters of a 10-minute release of all material in a single container to the air.  No passive mitigation is assumed.  This scenario assumes that a ton container ruptures.  The alternative-release scenario for chlorine would involve valve failure at the container head.\n\n11.  General Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.  The chlorine at the  WTP is an OSHA PSM covered substance.  As such, the Risk Management Prevention Program at Fort Monroe mirrors the OSHA PSM requirements.  Accordingly the Risk Management Prevention Program will be maintained by the DPW-ENV.  The Post Safety Office is responsible for meeting all applicable OSHA requirements.\n\n12.  Five-Year Accident History. The BB WTP has had no documented releases involving the chlorine usage during the past 5 years.\n\n13.  Emergency Response Program.  The Langley Air Force Base-Fire Department (LAFB-FD) consists of two fire stations and seventy (70) full-time responders.  The emergency response program will be operated and maintained by the LAFB-FD.  Because of the comprehensive operations of the FD, no procedural changes are expecte"

Specific actions which need to be undertaken are addressed in Section 7."
