The facility maintains approximately 180 full time employees. The facility produces and stores dairy products. The ammonia refrigeration system is defined as a closed loop \"Direct\" type system.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Dairies Fresno California facility has developed a risk management program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4, EPA Title 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119) and to enhance an already existing safety and emergency action programs. California Dairies is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. California Dairies staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\n\n\n California Dairies Fresno California facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. Their policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia systems are composed of the following key components:\n\n \n\n-Five Compressors\n\n-One high-pressure receiver\n\n-One Pump Receiver\n\n-One liquid ammonia transfer system\n\n-Three Accumulators\n\n-Two evaporative condensers\n\n-Two Chillers\n\n-Eleven Air Cooling evaporators \n\n-Three Milk Storage tanks\n\n-One automated system control \n\n\n\n\n\nSystem operation cycle begins at the high-pressure receiver where liquid "

      "SummaryText": "ammonia is fed from the receiver to the pump receiver, chiller surge drums, DX coil at the butter room, dryer intake coil and the damrow air dryer.  At this point the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature, then pumped or fed to the evaporator by pressure differential where it absorbs heat from the room air, secondary coolant or product. Vapor is returned to the pump receiver, surge drums and the accumulator from the evaporators where the gas is separated from the liquid and liquid is returned to the evaporators or transferred to the high-pressure receiver via the liquid ammonia transfer system. The gas is then drawn to the compressor where it is compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure. The superheated compressor discharge gas travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the high-pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\n\n\nScenario Description: Per the RMP and CalARP regulations one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the largest equipment item (given that the Ammonia Refrigeration System is comprised of interconnected equipment) we used the High Pressure Receiver releasing 9,000 pounds in 10.0 minutes. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences, only portions of the Ammonia Refrigeration System are located outside, however no credit was taken for containment.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by the RMP and CalARP regulations.  RMP*Comp was used as the OCA distance to endpoint. ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 150 ppm.  The results show that off-site areas will be affected.

For this alternative release scenario, the total quantity of ammonia calculated to be released is 846 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used. ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 200 ppm.   The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\n\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entertainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n-There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n\n- Floor d"
