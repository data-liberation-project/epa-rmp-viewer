Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is part of Brenntag, Inc.  Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is an advanced distribution company providing customers worldwide with products, chemicals and advanced materials. Our major operations are located in the Midwest and employ approximately 200 people. \n\n\n\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC (Brenntag) facility, located in Menomonee Falls Wisconsin, is a chemical distributor and repackaging facility.  One of the chemicals stored at the facility is Toluene Diisocyanate - Mixed Isomers (TDI).  The TDI storage process is determined to be Program 1.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario for this process involves a spill of the largest TDI storage tank (5,000 gallons) at the Menomonee Falls Facility.  In the event of a catastrophic release, the full inventory is assumed to spill and volatilize.  A secondary containment dike limits the maximum pool area.  The maximum distance to the endpoint does not reach a public receptor.  The calculated distance to the toxic endpoint is 67 feet.  The nearest property line is 79'-11\", which is abounded by a railroad right-of-way.  The release was assumed to occur outside even though the tanks are inside a building because of the building ventilation system.  \n\n\n\nIt is the worldwide policy of Brenntag to design, blend and distribute its products, and to manage those products throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.  This facility participates in the Responsible Distribution Process program of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  The Community Outreach and Emergency Response Plan of the Responsible Distribution Process program brings chemical distribution plants and local communities together through communication and cooperative emergency planni"
