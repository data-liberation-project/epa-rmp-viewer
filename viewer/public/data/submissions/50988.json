The facility receives propane in bulk form, stores it in a tank, and then transfills it into cylinders for distribution to customers by truck. The facility manufactures acetylene, fills tube trailers and fills cylinders, for distribution to customers by truck.\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n-Propane, which is transfilled from bulk storage into individual cylinders for sale to customers. \n-Acetylene, which is manufactured on-site and then filled into tube trailers or cylinders for sale to customers.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council?s program of Responsible Care? Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard and EPA?s Risk Management Program rule, the Jessup, MD  facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety I"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\nAn incident alarm system that can be activated manually for shutdown of the processes\nA heat activated automatic sprinkler system that is installed in the acetylene cylinder filling and storage areas.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Jessup facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.
