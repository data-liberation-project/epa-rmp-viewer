This commitment is demonstrated by the resources being invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of T E Products Pipeline Company, L P (TEPPCO) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Harford Mills Terminal located in Cortland County, New York, is owned by T E Products Pipeline Company, LP and is operated by TEPPCO.  \n\nThe Harford Mills  Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane and butane.  The propane is received from a T E Products Pipeline underground pipeline and is stored in any of seven above ground storage tanks or in the underground storage caverns.  The stored propane is transferred into highway transport trucks or rail tank cars for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.  Butane is received at the Harford Mills facility either from the underground pipeline or via delivery from rail tank cars, and is stored in the underground storage caverns.  As with the propane, the butane stored at the Harford Mills facility is sent out from the terminal either via highway transport trucks or in rail tank cars.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the truck filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection.  A small Ethyl mercaptan storage tank is on site to provide mercaptan inventory, but the amount of odorant stored at the terminal is below the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation.  The"

TEPPCO identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on facility knowledge.  Propane and butane are the only listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Harford Mills Terminal.  The Terminal is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the Executive Summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Harford Mills Terminal.  The processes at the terminal are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the terminal\u00bfs PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a \u00bfnear-miss\u00bf reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nTEPPCO actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  TEPPCO keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nTEPPCO also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and c"

This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Harford Mills  Terminal has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTEPPCO primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of TEPPCO staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  TEPPCO has recently conducted a complete hazard analysis on the operations at the Harford Mills Terminal, and is the process of acting upon the recommendations made by the PHA Team.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained."

These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings will also be documented and retained.\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Harford Mills Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Harford Mills Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the terminal.

The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nTEPPCO incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps to insure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Harford Mills Terminal has long standing safe work practices in place to help insure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to insure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to insure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help insure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Harford Mills Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage change to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as terminal equipment, technology (including terminal operating conditions), procedures and other facility chang"

Changes are reviewed to insure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Harford Mills Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help insure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, TEPPCO periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to terminal management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Harford Mills Terminal have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prev"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Harford Mills Terminal has safety features to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n \n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms in the storage and loading areas\n* Flame detection equipment in the storage and loading areas\n* Terminal video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Storage tank excess flow valves\n* Atmospheric relief devices.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers \n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, flame retardant coveralls, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Harford Mills Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past five years there have been no releases of flammable materials that resulted in any offsite injuries or other consequences, or onsite injuries or significant property damage.    \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Harford Mills Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  Th"
