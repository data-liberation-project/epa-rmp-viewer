Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nRoyal Ridge Fruit and Cold Storage (RR) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of RR to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\n\nRR refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases less than 300ppm and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive initial hire and yearly refresher training on this plan.\n\n\n\nAt RR anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\n\nPrevent unnecessary human exposure to the EHS\n\nReduce the threat of exposure to our personnel\n\nReduce the threat to the community and the surrounding ecosystem\n\n\n\nB.Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nRR is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located approximately one mile south-south east of Royal City, which is located in Grant county and within the state of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at RR is anhydrous ammonia.  Chemical Abstract Number (CAS) # 7664-41-7.  The substance is used as a refrigerant. There is approximately 29,722 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the system as of this revision.  \n\n\n\nRR uses other hazardous substances on-site; however, they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, RR believes in the concept set forth in the General Duty Clause of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, RR plans to established policies, procedu"

The worst-case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest vessel would release 17,219 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would occur outside the compressor room. From a short pipe in an horizontal tank (not burning) The duration of the release was 1 hour at 291 Pounds/min.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - A leak from a short pipe in a vertical cylindrical tank (not burning) The release would occur \n\nin the plant production area. The duration of the release was 2 minutes at 238 pounds/min.  \n\n\n\nBoth the worst-case and alternative scenarios are unlikely due to the safeties on the system such as temperature and pressure cutouts, computer controls and pressure relief valves to prevent an over pressure situation.\n\n\n\nA more realistic scenario would be that of a pressure relief valve lifting, discharging ammonia vapor from vents on top of the building, approximately 40 feet above the ground.  In scenarios modeled for this type of an event, the risk radius was reduced to approximately 325 feet. \n\n\n\nD.General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nRRFs accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\n\nInitial and continued training of personnel\n\nPreventative maintenance programs as described in the PSM\n\nUse of safety equipment and procedures\n\nUse of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\n\n\nRRF complies with:\n\n\n\nOSHAs and Washington States process"
