Following any system modifications, a pre-startup safety review procedure needs to be followed.\r\n\r\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed for normal and emergency operations. The SOPs provide written operating instructions for operating the chlorine system, and they include procedures for container deliveries and container change-outs. Equipment inspections, testing and maintenance activities are performed on a routine basis and documented in a computerized maintenance management system (MAXIMO). All operators are state-certified treatment operators, and all operators and mechanics are required to be trained in the SOPs for the chlorine system.\r\n\r\nCompliance audits have been conducted for the risk management program to verify compliance with the Cal-ARP and RMP regulations. SCWA has a procedure to investigate any incident or accident that results in the release of a reportable quantity of chlorine. Incident investigation procedures include root cause analysis.\r\n\r\nSCWA operators and mechanics are trained as first responders under the HAZWOPER standard for emergency response. However, only members of the Emergency Response team are trained to respond to an emergency. Guidance is provided to the operators and mechanics to help them distinguish between an incidental release and an emergency. In the event of an emergency, the procedures are to notify the response agencies, evacuate to a safe area, and assess the cause of the release, if this can be done safely. The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the local response agencies, and SCWA will cooperate with these agencies to coordinate any offsite response that may be required in an emergency. \r\n\r\nFollowing each PHA revalidation, SCWA implements recommendations to improve safety. These improvements include equipment modifications, improvements to the detection and monitoring system, a"

      "SummaryText": "Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA) owns and operates the Wohler Chlorine Building,  located on Wohler Road near the town of Forestville, in Sonoma County, California. This facility is a water treatment facility that is covered by the California Accidental Release Prevention (Cal-ARP) program and the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations because it has chlorine onsite in excess of the RMP threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nIt is SCWA's policy to comply with the Cal-ARP and RMP regulatory requirements. SCWA employees, supervisors and managers are all responsible for complying with these regulations. Agency employees and managers are provided with training to familiarize them with their requirements and responsibilities. \r\n\r\nSCWA has developed a process safety and risk management program that documents the policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases. In addition, SCWA has conducted technical studies such as the Process Hazards Analysis and the Offsite Consequence Analysis to identify and evaluate potential hazards associated with the use of chlorine at the Wohler Chlorine Building. SCWA has emergency procedures and an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP), and these are coordinated with County of Sonoma Fire & Emergency Services Department. \r\n \r\nA management system is in place for implementing the RMP and Cal-ARP regulations. This system defines the scope and purpose for each program element, procedures for implementation, roles and responsibilities, and the record-keeping requirements. The SCWA Safety Officer has responsibility to coordinate the implementation of the risk management program. Delegated responsibilities are outlined in the SCWA's written programs. \r\n\r\nAt the Wohler Chlorine Building, chlorine is used for disinfection in the water treatment process. Chlorine is supplied in one-ton containers, which are stored inside a chlorine building. The room has capacity to store five one-ton containers of chlorine (10,000 pounds).

      "SummaryText": "place to ensure that the maximum number of containers never exceeds the specified number.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the chlorine containers, the chlorination system includes vacuum regulators, chlorinators and chlorine injectors, all connected by industry-standard pvc piping. The chlorine flow rate is set at the chlorinator to dose the correct amount of chlorine at the point of application. The design is inherently safe with the vacuum regulator placed directly on the ton container. This means that if there is any damage to the piping system downstream there will be a break in the vacuum, and the flow of chlorine will stop at the regulator.\r\n\r\nAll chlorine equipment is housed inside the chlorine building. Leak detectors have been installed to monitor for chlorine leaks. If chlorine is detected, it triggers a local alarm, it relays an alarm signal to the SCWA's Operations Center in Santa Rosa, and it activates a scrubber. \r\n\r\nIn developing the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), the approach taken was to follow the EPA's Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Facilities. This guidance was used to help select the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for chlorine, and to evaluate the hazard distances for both scenarios. EPA's Landview program was used to estimate the population that would be affected by a release. Details of the OCA methodologies and the OCA results are included in reports held by SCWA in Santa Rosa.\r\n\r\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidents involving chlorine that resulted in any offsite impacts, and there have been no serious injuries or fatalities onsite. \r\n\r\nSCWA has implemented a comprehensive prevention program to minimize the potential for a catastrophic release of chlorine at the Wohler Chlorine Building. Process safety information is available to employees, and a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) has been conducted. External events were considered in the PHA, and a seismic assessment has also been conducted. Recommendations made by"
