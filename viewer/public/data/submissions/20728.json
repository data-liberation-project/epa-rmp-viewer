      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe chemical manufacturing industry synthesizes many products which provide benefits enjoyed by our society.  These include plastics, adhesives, paints, fuel additives, and agricultural chemicals just to name a few.  The manufacture of many of these products unavoidably uses substances regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68).  In using, storing  and handling these regulated substances, Chevron Chemical Company's Orange, Texas facility recognizes the potential for community and environmental receptors exposure.  Because of concern over the potential impacts of accidental releases to the community and the environment, the Orange, Texas Facility's Management is committed to full compliance with the requirements of the EPA RMP Rule.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nChevron Chemical Company's Orange, Texas Facility management demonstrates its commitment to safety and the environment by enforcing Chevron's Corporate Policy 530.  Policy 530 states that the Company will conduct scientific hazards assessments in order to identify, characterize, and safely manage any potential hazards of company operations.  Additionally, the Orange, Texas facility demonstrates its commitment to process safety management through active implementation of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Responsible Care Program.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nChevron Chemical Company's Orange, Texas Facility located on FM 1006, Orange, Texas, manufactures high density polyethylene plastics.  These plastics are used to manufacture consumer products such as milk bottles, plastic piping, and other plastic products.\n\nThe manufacture of high density polyethylene plastics at the Orange, Texas Facility require the use of the following regulated chemicals:\n\nEthylene - Ethylene gas (CAS 74-85-1) is the primary raw material in the manufacture of low density and high density pol"

Ethylene molecules polymerize under the presence of a catalyst or an initiator to form polyethylene.\n\nIsopentane - Isopentane (CAS 78-78-4)  is used to prepare a catalyst mixture which is used in the manufacture of  high density polyethylene.\n\nIsobutane - Isobutane (CAS 75-28-5) is a diluent or carrier agent used in the manufacture of high density polyethylene.  This substance is not generally involved in the chemical polymerization reaction.\n\nPropane - Propane (CAS 74-98-6) is used in the high density polyethylene manufacturing process as a refrigerant.  Propane is used to condense various substances in the process such as ethylene, isobutane and isopentane.\n\nn-Butane - n-Butane (CAS 106-97-8) comes in mixed with the isobutane which is used as a diluent in the manufacture of high density polyethylene.\n\n\nQuantities Handled or Stored\n\nIsopentane:   210,000 lbs\nEthylene:   120,000 lbs\nIsobutane:   780,000 lbs\nPropane:   280,000 lbs\nn-Butane:   440,000 lbs\n\n\nWORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nToxic Worse Case Scenario:\nThe Chevron Orange, manufacturing facility has no listed toxics above Threshold Quantity. This resubmission is based partly on the removal of vinyl acetate from our chemical inventory. Vinyl acetate, a listed toxic, was listed as a Worst Case and Alternate Case toxic on our first submission, and has now been removed from the Orange, Texas facility.\n\nFlammable Worse Case Scenario:\nThe Worst Case and Alternate Case Flammable scenarios for the Orange, Texas facility have changed due to the removal of 1-butene from our plant.\nThe worst case flammable scenario by EPA definition is a vapor cloud explosion of the single vessel with the greatest amount of flammable material.  For the Orange plant, the vessel with the potentially largest quantity of flammable material is V-501, containing 240,000 lbs. of isobutane.  Using the EPA look-up tables, the distance to a 1.0 psi blast overpressure is predicted to have off site impacts. \n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE REL"

      "SummaryText": "EASE SCENARIOS\n\nToxic Alternative Release Scenario\n\nChevron - Orange Chemical Plant has no listed toxic materials above Threshold Quantity.\n\n\nFlammable Alternative Release Scenario\n\nSome specific scenarios that were analyzed include:\n\n1. Release of a flammable material and forming a flammable vapor cloud\n2. Release of a flammable material and igniting, which forms a jet fire.\n3. Vapor cloud explosion, with a lower yield factor than for worst case.  \n4. BLEVE, (Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion).\n\nThe above scenarios were analyzed for all the flammable materials,  (isopentane, ethylene, isobutane, & propane).  Scenarios types 1 & 2 did not go off-site and would not be candidates for submitting as an alternative release scenario.  It was decided that a VCE would be a more likely incident, (even though a very low probability), than a BLEVE.  The vessel with the longest distance for a vapor cloud explosion is V-501, with a quantity of 51,270 gallons.  The calculated distance to a 1.0 psi blast overpressure is predicted to have off site impacts.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility complies with the requirements of the OSHA PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  The management systems used to comply with the OSHA PSM requirements comprise the accidental release prevention program for this facility.\n\nIn general, the accidental release prevention program includes programs in the following general categories:\n\nSafety In Design\n\n\u00b7 Use of applicable codes and CCC Technology Standards meet or exceed regulatory standards\n\u00b7 Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity \n\u00b7 Fire water monitors are strategically located\n\u00b7 Pumps and compressor systems are designed to minimize releases\n\u00b7 Tanks are nitrogen purged to reduce the potential for a fire or explosion\n\u00b7 Unloading hoses are designed to resist chemical attack\n\u00b7 Backflow from tanks is minimized by use of check valves\n\u00b7 Equipment is electrically grounded to prevent sparks\n\u00b7 Dikes,"
