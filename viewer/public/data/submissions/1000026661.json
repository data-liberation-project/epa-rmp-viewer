      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary \n\n\n\nKM Phoenix - Curtis Bay Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending System, including the associated piping and one 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel.  KM Phoenix owns the real property associated with the Butane Blending System.  Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC. (Sunoco) owns all the equipment associated with the Butane Blending System.  Sunoco and Kinder Morgan Liquid Terminals, LLC (KMLT) each have operational responsibilities for the Butane Blending System.  KM-Phoenix, Sunoco and KMLT are collectively known as the Parties.  Sunoco controls and monitors all butane blending operations remotely from its control center located in Houston, Texas.  KMLT oversees the delivery and unloading of butane trucks into the storage vessel.\n\n\n\nSunoco constructed the Butane Blending System in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) #58 (2011 Edition) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage.  Sunoco designed, constructed, and maintains the Butane Blending System, in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations.\n\n\n\nIt is the Parties' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the Parties' policy to notify the Anne Arundel County Fire Department as well as the Anne Arundel County Office of Emergency Management.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services (Anne Arundel County Fire Dept. EMS Division) and Harbor Hospital, the nearest full service hospital/emergency department.\n\n\n\nThe Curtis Bay Butane Blending System's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The system's alternate (potential off-site "

      "SummaryText": "impact) release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" accident and associated fireball.\n\n\n\nThe Parties comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.  This facility has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Butane Blending System, it is The Parties' policy to initially contact the Anne Arundel County Fire Department (Station #31 is primary responder) and request their assistance.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Anne Arundel County Office of Emergency Management.  The Anne Arundel County Fire Department and Baltimore City Fire Department have participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\n\n\nProcess safety controls include: excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.  Additional vessel protection includes an intumescent coating. Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this \"stationary source\" as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection. \n\n\n\nThe Parties actively seek employee input, on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Anne Arundel County Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion.\n\n"
