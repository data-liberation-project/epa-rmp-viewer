      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Elkem Metals Company (Elkem) facility in Alloy, West Virginia utilizes anhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2) to treat boiler off-gases. Because sulfur dioxide is a compound listed by the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), management of the flue gas conditioning process is regulated by these two agencies.  \n\nIn order to comply with regulatory requirements and to protect the health and safety of its employees, the surrounding community and the environment, Elkem has established a comprehensive risk management program to ensure continued safety of its day-to-day processes and operations.\n\nPrimary activities, use of regulated substance and quantities stored:\n\nIn the conditioning process, SO2 is converted to sulfur trioxide (SO3), which is then injected into the flue gas stream.  The SO3 adjusts the flue gas properties thereby improving electrostatic precipitator performance and reducing particulate emissions from the boiler.  A maximum of nine 1-ton SO2 cylinders are stored at the facility at one time, for a maximum on site quantity of 18,000 pounds.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention:\nElkem has established a comprehensive risk management system that meets the requirements of OSHA PSM and EPA RMP standards to ensure the safe operation of the conditioning process.  To identify potential SO2 release situations, Elkem has analyzed the conditioning process, how the elements interact, how the equipment can fail and has implemented practices to prevent and react to failures.  In addition, Elkem has established facility-wide procedures on managing hazardous activities, such as welding, and process-specific procedures addressing the hazards, operations and maintenance activities unique to the conditioning process.  All personnel that may be required to perform these activities are trained in the proper procedures. Employees also participate in the deve"

Process changes are analyzed before implementation to prevent creation of new hazards, and new equipment is routinely inspected and tested before it is placed in service. \n\nFive year accident history:\n\nIn the last five years there have been no reportable releases of SO2 from the Alloy, West Virginia facility or OSHA reportable incidents involving employees working with the SO2 flue gas system.  Elkem fully investigates every incident that occurs at the facility and has developed an emergency response program that includes on-site personnel specially trained to handle SO2 releases.  These specially trained personnel work in coordination with the Fayette County LEPC.\n\nThe emergency response program\nElkem maintains an emergency response plan for SO2 flue gas additive system and the site.  Both plans are currently undergoing revisions due to personnel changes at the site.  Elkem annually conducts an emergency response drill for the SO2 flue gas additive system with area personnel.  Typically once every three years the emergency response drill is expanded to include the site, SO2 cylinder vender and the Fayette County LEPC.  Each drill is critiqued.  Any deficiencies noted in the drill are prioritized and then addressed as resources become available.    \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nElkem completed a PHA revalidation for the SO2 flue gas additive system.  Elkem will be focusing resources on addressing the recommendations of the PHA revalidation team."
