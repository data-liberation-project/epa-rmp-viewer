We have focused our attention and resources towards the protection of our employees, the public, and in particular those areas involving the operation of our warehouse refrigeration system.  We have gone beyond the standard for protection from accidental contact with refrigeration components (ie. placing steel racks/cases around exposed piping and air handling units) and have provided detection equipment at critical component locations for the quick detection and mitigation of materials, in the event of a release.\n\nMinyard Food Stores, Inc. operates a distribution center for the purpose of supplying our retail grocery stores.  Included in our warehousing operations is the cold storage of products.  This portion of the warehouse utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The refrigeration process contains approximately 25,000 pounds of refrigerant.  Simulating a release utilizing the EPA's Risk Management Plan calculations, our release of ammonia in a worst case scenario would result in the potential exposure of an area from the warehouse motor room with a four-tenths of a mile radius.  Contained within that radius are several businesses and approximately four residences.  This scenario would involve the loss of power resulting in the automatic return of ammonia to the main vessel of the three storage vessels; and the subsequent failure of a pressure relief valve causing a release of ammonia.  The mitigation of such a release, would be through early detection and notification of appropriate staff that is capable of assessing the situation remotely and begin the mitigation process (ie. isolating the point of release by valving-off the affected area, recalling the ammonia back to the storage vessels, and/or shutting down the process). Our alternative scenario would involve normal operation of the system, but a failure of a check valve resu"

The Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard for covered facilities requires the implimentation of thirteen elements, which are listed and summerized below:\n\n           1.  Employee Participation - active involvement of employees in the development and implimentation of\n                the Process Safety Management Program.\n           2.  Process Safety Information - having and making available to employees information pertaining to\n                the process, hazardous material data, and diagraming.\n           3.
