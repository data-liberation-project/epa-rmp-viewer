The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\r\n\r\nThis facility has not had an accidental release in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, \r\n\r\nEmergency Procedures Information\r\n\r\nThe Iowa City Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Iowa City Terminal is coordinated with the Johnson County Emergency Management (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Iowa City Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Iowa City Terminal conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Iowa City Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Iowa City Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\r\n* High temperature fire detectors on the propane loading rack pumps\r\n* Low temperature seal leak detectors on the propane loading rack pumps\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n* Area relief valves and vents that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\r\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid ethyl mercaptan.\r\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\r\n* Storage tank emergency shutdown valves\r\n* Loading line excess flow valves\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\r\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nRecords are kept fo"
