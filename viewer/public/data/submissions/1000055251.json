Dodge, Iowa\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nFOR \r\nTHE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Policies\r\n\r\nKoch Fertilizer Ft. Dodge, LLC (KFFD) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  KFFD's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nKFFD produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  \r\n\r\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in cooling towers) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at KFFD in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\r\n\r\n \r\nThis RMP consists of one process, nitrogenous fertilizer manufacturing.  The prevention program is divided"

This RMP includes three prevention programs corresponding with the PHAs conducted by the facility; these are Ammonia, UAN /Chlorine /Utilities and Loading & Storage.  This update is being submitted to EPA due to the construction of a new cryogenic tank at the facility and the improvement of the containment area surrounding the storage tanks.  The upgraded containment area will contain the contents of the largest tank, which has reduced the worst-case scenario by a factor of two.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n  \r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KFFD.  These high standards include:\r\n\r\n-Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n-Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n-Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n-Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nKFFD is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped minimize the severity of chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n-Constructing a blast-proof building to house our control room, maintenance personnel, and administrative offices.  The building may also be used as an emergency shelter as needed.\r\n-Installing ammonia det"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be Trinity Regional Medical Center, Webster County Emergency Management Agency, and the Iowa State Patrol.

The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\t\r\n\tCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\r\n\t\r\n-The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\r\n-The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\r\n-The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\r\n\r\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\r\n\r\n-Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\r\n-An ongoing dialogue with the Region V LEPC, Webster County Sheriff and the Vincent Fire Department as well as facility membership on the LEPC will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.  \r\n\r\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to contact the Region V LEPC for the latest information on emergency response for the county.  The facility coordinates its response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
