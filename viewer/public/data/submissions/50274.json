      "SummaryText": "Swiss American Sausage Company is a processed cured meat producer.  This is a new facility built in late 1999.  The primary purpose of this facility is to further process meat into food products for distribution to retailers.\n\nAmmonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed, and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation, and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  Under these programs, ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle the ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place for many years.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.  It is believed that this food processing facility complies with all applicable codes and regulations.\n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a formal training program. This program consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure equipment integrity.  \n\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \n\nA?    Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\nA?    Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \n\nA?    The Plant has an overall safety pro"

A process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted in 1999 and a PHA re-validation was conducted twice with the most recent in 2007.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\nA?    Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\nA?    For projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\nA?    Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\nA?    The Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon Federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency respo"

Approximately 58 lbs of ammonia was released.  Local authorities made decision for nearby businesses to make a voluntary decision to shelter-in-place or go home.
