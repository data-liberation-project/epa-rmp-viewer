      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nThe City of Olathe operates two water treatment facilities.  Water Treatment Plant Number 1 is a 4-million gallon per day, conventional plant.  The facility is used as a peaking plant, operated from May through September of each year.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Clean Air Act, Section 112r regulated substances maintained at the Water Treatment Plant Number 1, which will be referred to herein as the Plant.  This Executive Summary has been updated as of April 18, 2002 to reflect the installation of a chlorine scrubber system.  \n\nPlant Description\nThe Plant maintains two regulated substances: ammonia and chlorine.  The maximum ammonia storage amount is 8,380 pounds, which is well below the RMP rule threshold quantity of 20,000 pounds.  The chlorine storage on-site is 8,000 lbs which exceeds the 2,500 lbs threshold quantity.  \nThe storage and management of the chlorine system are addressed in this RMP.  A description of the chlorine system is included in this section.\n\nThe Plant is located in an urban area, at 600 South Curtis, Olathe, Kansas.  The surrounding population includes commercial and residential properties as well as public access sites.  The Plant is situated 5,000 feet west of Interstate 35; 1,500 feet west of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad; and 2,500 feet north of Old 56 Highway.  Water Works Lake is immediately adjacent to the Plant.  \n\nWorst Cast Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario for chlorine was calculated as the loss of a single one-tone cylinder in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance for RMP development.  Also in accordance with the guidance, engineered control devices or measures were not taken into account as mitigative factors in the analysis.  Only positive controls, such as the containment provided by the building housing the cylinders was considered.  The conditions of the scenario, such as release time and weather status are those s"

Determination of the area of potential impact was determined using the RMP*Comp, modeling software developed by the EPA.  \n\nThe results of the Off-Site Consequence Analysis indicated that the chlorine would travel approximately 4750 feet under the specified weather conditions before dispersing in the atmosphere to a harmless concentration.  Within the radius of that dispersion area, approximately 8,900 people could potentially be affected.  A map of the area and a list of the types of receptors in the potential impact area are provided in the off-Site Impact Analysis Section.  The list of potential receptors includes:\n- Kansas School for the Deaf\n- Nursing homes (3)\n- Daycare facilities (4)\n- Salvation Army\n- County Jail\n- County Courthouse\n- County Administration Building\n- First Christian Church\n- VoTech school\n- Elementary school (2)\n- First Methodist Church\n- Church of God Holiness\n- St. Marks Lutheran Church\n- Olathe Christian Church\n\n\nThe likelihood of such an incident occurring is minimal.  Historically, there have been no recorded releases as a result of such tank failure from stationary chlorine tanks (White 1999) \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more plausible release scenario than the worst case release.  Engineered controls, such as the chlorine scrubber, can be considered in the analysis.  The type of system failure selected for the alternative release was the loss of chlorine due to failure of tow diaphragms on one of the vacuum regulators.  Failure of the diaphragms would allow for loss of chlorine from the cylinder through the vacuum regulatory to the chlorine storage room atmosphere.  The chlorine would be leaked from a one-inch line on the vacuum regulator.  The leak would trigger activation of the scrubber system when the concentration of chlorine in the room reached 3 ppm.  With activation of the scrubber, the air in the room would be"

There are Operation and Maintenance Manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel receive significant training before being allowed to work on the system.\n\nAt the beginning of each of the three shifts, and as each cylinder is changed, the valves and piping are tested for leaks.  There are standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation, and emergency operation.  The SOPs are written and posted in appropriate areas.  Personnel are trained routinely on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.  \n\nMajor factors providing control and mitigation in the event of a release o"

The vacuum regulators are mounted on each chlorine cylinder thus minimizing the probability of a chlorine leak.  \n\n2. The City has detailed procedures for the loading and unloading of chlorine cylinders, changing a chlorine cylinder, upkeep of the system, tagging procedures, and emergency response procedures. \n\n3. The City has detailed inspection procedures to check the chlorine detector weekly as well as a general inspection of the chlorine room three times a day. \n\n4. The City maintains excellent records on the training for each individual employee. \n\n5. The City installed a chlorine scrubber that serves the area where the chlorine tanks are maintained.  That room is isolated within the structure and equipped with audio and visual alarms that are tripped when scrubber operation is initiated.  The scrubber is set to activate when the concentration of chlorine within the room reaches 3 ppm of chlorine.  A warning is indicated at SCADA when the concentration reaches 1 ppm chlorine in the area.\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nPlant personnel are trained and allowed to respond to leaks that can be managed by turning off a valve.  Any response requiring entry in a dangerous atmosphere or use of chlorine repair kit will be managed by the Olathe Fire Department.  The Plant has an agreement with the Fire Department.  A complete copy of the facility emergency response plane and Fire Department Guidelines is included in this RMP.\n\nAccident History\nOlathe Water Treatment Plant No. 1 has had no leaks of chlorine over the past five years."
