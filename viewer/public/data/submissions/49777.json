We submitted our 1999 Risk Management Plan under the name \"GE Plastics\".  As of August 31, 2007, GE Plastics changed ownership and became SABIC Innovative Plastics.    It is the stated policy of SABIC IP to safely manage our site operations.  In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur.\n\nThe efforts at our Ottawa, IL facility have been recognized by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), who oversees our programs, as among the best in the nation for worker safety. \n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.  If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plans, please contact our Human Resources Department at (815) 433-7463. \n \n0.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical and plastics production facilities everywhere we do business. Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.\n  \nIn order to provide top quality products for our customers, the Ottawa facility uses in its manufacturing process some raw materials that are classified as toxic or flammable. We are committed to comply with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain a safe operation.   Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to pr"

      "SummaryText": "event an accidental release of a chemical.  However, if a major release does occur, our trained on-site emergency response organization will be activated. This organization includes a fire brigade as well as medical and chemical emergency response teams.\n\nThe outstanding programs at the Ottawa facility have earned the OSHA STAR award, presented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for exemplary safety management.  This is OSHA's highest award for safety performance.   Because of this exemplary performance, the OSHA Training Institute has chosen to use the Ottawa plant site eight times for Process Safety Management (PSM) training.\n\n0.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe SABIC IP plant is located on a 215-acre tract along the Illinois River about three miles east of Ottawa.  It was built in 1967 and currently employs about 280 people in the Illinois River Valley.  SABIC IP manufactures engineered thermoplastics, marketed under the trade name CYCOLAC?.  Our products are used in automotive, medical, electronic, computer, and appliance industries to name a few. \n \nIn order to ensure quality products, quality service and quality of life, the former GE Plastics has invested more than $85 million prior to the 1999 submittal for expansion, capital improvement, safety and environmental protection, and an additional 44 million in the last 5 years.\n  \nThe Ottawa, IL plant uses two chemicals that are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  These are acrylonitrile, a regulated toxic substance; and, 1,3-butadiene, a regulated flammable substance.  Acrylonitrile and butadiene are raw materials used to manufacture our products.\n \n0.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION / CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSABIC IP has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (or PSM).  PSM is an integral part of working safely at SABIC IP facilit"

PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention program requirements of the RMP.  \n\nSome of the many, specific safety features to prevent a chemical accident include:\n\n? Railroad tankcars are regulated and inspected under U.S. Department of Transportation regulations that require periodic pressure testing and are built to stringent safety standards that provide protection in the event of a rail accident.\n\n? Safety instrumentation, high tank level shutoffs, and procedures that reduce the potential for human error which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n\n? Shut-off valves for the butadiene and acrylonitrile storage tanks that can be closed from a remote location, if needed;\n\n? Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks to contain a spill;\n\n? Butadiene and acrylonitrile gas sensors to detect and warn of a release in the tank farm and latex operating areas;\n\n? Local spill containment around acrylonitrile railcars at the unloading station to mitigate the impact of a leak;\n\n? Acrylonitrile railcar and butadiene unloading operations are continuously attended by Tank Farm Technicians who have had specialized training in US Department Of Transportation (DOT) requirements;\n\n? An inherently safer process for latex manufacturing.  Under this process, the amount of butadiene is controlled such that if a problem were to be detected that required the process to be shutdown, the chemical reaction would immediately cease before an unsafe condition could develop; \n\n? A computer-controlled Safety Instrumented System (SIS) on the latex manufacturing process to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected. \n \n?

Safety reviews prior to startup of process changes; and,\n\n? Safety permit procedures that control hazards during special operations such as welding and other maintenance activities. \n\n 0.5 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Ottawa, IL site has an outstanding record of accident prevention which demonstrates its commitment to public and worker safety.  Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences. \n \nEPA requires that all incidents involving regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impacts are reported in this document.  During the previous five-year period (June 21, 1999 through the date of this submittal), no such incidents occurred at the plant.\n\n 0.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Ottawa, IL site maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, the public, and the environment in the event of a major accidental release.

Our trained fire brigade, medical and chemical response teams work closely with area hospitals, industries, and other response organizations in the Marseilles - Ottawa, IL area.  \n\nThe Ottawa Site Tactical Response Team (TRT) has received extensive training from the Illinois Fire Academy at the University of Illinois, at Mobil Oil - Joliet, IL and Excelon - Morris, IL.  Training is conducted at the site on the Ottawa Site Emergency Response Plan, fire fighting methods / operations, hazardous material response and advanced rope rescue.\n\nEmergency medical response is a part of the site TRT System.  These personnel have been trained by St. Mary's Hospital Emergency Room Staff, Community Hospital of Ottawa and Ottawa Fire Department personnel to respond to potential medical emergency conditions at the Emergency Medical System - First Responder level.  An ongoing training program has been in place for these personnel for the last 8 years.  In order to ensure prompt medical attention for serious conditions, the Ottawa Site has coordinated with Life Flight medical helicopter support centers (St. Francis - Peoria and Loyola - Chicago).\n\nThe Ottawa Site TRT is involved in a Mutual Aid Agreement with the Marseilles Area Fire Protection District.  Since the beginning of this relationship, SABIC IP, Marseilles Area Fire Protection District and the Ottawa Fire Department have conducted joint training to further develop emergency response skills.  Current plans call for:\n\n? Continuing the relationships developed in the Marseilles - Ottawa - Seneca Community Advisory Panel, meeting as often as is needed; and,\n\n?
