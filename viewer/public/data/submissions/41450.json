      "SummaryText": "Wilkins-Rogers, Inc.a flour milling company located at 27 Frederick Road, Ellicott City, Baltimore County Maryland. The substance in use is chlorine used to bleach flour in order to change the ph of the product and to improve baking quality.the chlorine tanks are located on the second floor of the facility in their own separate room. The piping runs up to the 5th and the 8th floors of the flour mill and are clearly identifiable and are marked clearly. The monitoing system and the valves used to control the amount added to the flour at any given time are located on the 5th floor of the flour mill. The alarm for the system is located in the millers office on the 4th floor of the flour mill. We are supplied with chlorine through American Ingredients Company. American Ingredients Company comes in on an annual basis to train and review procedures with those employees that work with or come in contact with the chlorine cylinders and those employees who are responsible on operating the chlorine equipment.  In addition, American Ingredients Company comes in on a quarterly basis to check out all equipment including but not limited to tanks, lines, valves, connectors, diaghrams, rotometers and on an annual basis our local fire company conducts an inspection of  the entire facility in order to train new employees and to familiarize themselves with the facility.if a release would occur there is the possibility that the chlorine could impact off our facility grounds. If this were to happen in our emergency response program we are to inform the local authorites immediately by calling 911. The chlorine is housed in its own structure which should slow down its movement in either a worse case or alternative.  In order to increase our own capabilities to help in responding to a situation we are in the process of increasing our training in order to be able to assist the local emergency response authorities."
