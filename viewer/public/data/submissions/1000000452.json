      "SummaryText": "The North Reverse Plant has had a Process Safety Management plan in effect since April 2, 1990. The plan includes safety, health and environmental requirements for production and quality management. Responsibility for protecting people, property and the enviroment begins with the ranking facility manager and extends through all levels of the line management organization. Each person in the organization has specific responsibilities that they cannot delegate. One important part of the overall safety and health program involves the prevention of unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals into locations which could expose employees and others to hazards as well as the environment and the surrounding community.  The Process Safety Management Program complies with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119, process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals. Our risk management program describes the management system for protecting people, property and the environment from releaseof hazardous chemicals (chlorine gas) in the work place. This is accomplished by systematically evaluating the process using approaches to access the effectiveness of the process design, technology, operations, maintenance, procedures, emergency preparedness, training and other elements. We reviewed our procedures in July of 2008 and added some safety measures. It was decided that a release would be more likely during the process of changing ton cylinders. With this in mind we are now attempting to change cylinders at times when the schools and recreational facilities in the area are not being used . This will lower the number of people exposed if a leak did occur. We also have made chemical safety a major part of our regular safety training with plant operators. The chlorine detector in the ton cylinder storage room is tested 3 times per day. The chlorine detector in the feed room is tested, with a solution, one time per week. Both rooms are inspected for leaks or any other problem 3 times per day. We al"
