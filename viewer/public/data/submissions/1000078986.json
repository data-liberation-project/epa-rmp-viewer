This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at LyondellBasell La Porte. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\nLyondellBasell La Porte's primary activities encompass olefins, and polymer and resins manufacturing.
