      "SummaryText": "Lake\u00c2\u00bfs Farm Service, LLC. supplies farmers with the anhydrous ammonia needed to grow their crops. We receive the product by semi truck, or rail car, and unload it into our 30,000 gal. storage tank. We then use this tank to fill the smaller nurse wagons that we deliver to the farms. All vessels are filled to a capacity of 85% or less. Our largest process is when we have a rail car hooked for unloading to our storage tank. We qualify for Program Level 2 of the RMP. We are also compliant with the EPCRA section 302, and annually report to our SERC, LEPC and Local Fire Department. We follow the design codes of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), the ANSI standards, the ANSME standards, and the Indiana Agricultural Ammonia Law. We are considered a Shipper of Hazardous Materials with the US Department of Transportation, so we are also compliant with that industry. We hold a Hazardous Materials Safety Permit with them. We continually work to maintain our equipment to industry specifications and keep our employees trained on the proper use and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In case of an emergency, we have a plan in place to minimize the effects, as well as a Security Plan. All employees are trained at least annually on these plans. We have specific operating procedures in place that employees are trained to follow, as well as the proper usage and care of the required PPE. We have had no incidents in the previous 5 years, as well as years prior to that. We are continually updating and maintaining our anhydrous ammonia process to be as safe and state-of-the art as possible."
