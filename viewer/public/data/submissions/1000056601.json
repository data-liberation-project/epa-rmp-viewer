The estimated residential population would be 15 people.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and prevention steps include:\r\nA) Employee education and training\r\nB) All employees receive initial and yearly refresher training in our hazardous communication program, and spill response plans\r\nC) Incident investigation procedures are followed in addressing areas of concern\r\nD) An emergency action plan is used to document and train employees to handle non-routine situations\r\nE) Daily inventory reconciliation of the blowing agent tank is conducted\r\nF) Maintenance personnel physically inspect the blowing agent system each shift (2-times per day) and inspect the hazardous material storage area.\r\nG) The blowing agent equipment is equipped with electronic sensors which are monitored 24 hours per day by plant personnel and a private security firm.\r\nH) The blowing agent tank is coated with fire protective material which is rated for 2 hours and a water deluge protective system.\r\nI) The blowing agent equipment and tank is protected by an assortment of physical barriers.\r\nJ) The blowing agent equipment and tank are installed under the recommendations of the National Fire Protection Association Codes 58 and 70.\r\n\r\nThe fire year accident history: We have had no accidental releases of the blowing agent in the past five years.

The health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities are among our primary concerns. Polycell is committed to provide a safe work environment, to promote the safe design, use and handling of Polycell\u00bfs products and to comply with the laws relating to the protection of the environment. Each employee is expected to promote these goals in their everyday tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolycell\u00bfs Biola facility manufactures polyethylene foam products using an extruder. The extruder performs three distinct functions: melts and plasticizes the polyethylene, disperses and mixes the blowing agent with polyethylene, and cools the mixture sufficiently to prevent cell collapse when the material is extruded through dies. Polyethylene resin pellets are melted in the extruder. The blowing agent (isobutane or propane) is pumped into the extruder under high pressure. Once the polyethylene/blowing agent mixture leaves the dies, the mixture is no longer under pressure. The blowing agent is stored in an approved pressure vessel as non-odorized liquid petroleum under pressure of 125 psi max. The liquid is pumped at low pressure to high pressure metering system controls which controls the flow of the blowing agent into the extruder.\r\n\r\nThe facility has one liquid petroleum storage tank rated at 250 psi and has a water capacity of 15,768 gallons. The worst case release scenarios and the alternative scenarios: \r\n\r\nA flammable worst case scenario assumes a butane vapor cloud explosion using EPA RMP-comp guidance for a liquid propane storage facility.
