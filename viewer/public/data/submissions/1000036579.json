This certification is intended to comply with the 40 CFR 68.185 requirements.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nRaft River Energy 1 LLC of Cassia County, Idaho,is a geothermal power production facility. The Raft River Facility uses 183,000 pounds of isopentane in the heat exchange/electrical generation process.  Isopentane is stored at the facility in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold quantity defined in 40 CFR 68.130. The facility has been identified as meeting the regulatory criteria requiring submittal of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The objective of the RMP is to prevent the accidental release of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and/or the environment from short-term (acute) exposure and to mitigate the severity of a release that may occur.  \r\n\r\nTitle 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 68.12 requires a facility with extremely hazardous toxic and flammable substances used in its process in an amount exceeding a threshold quantity to develop and implement a RMP.  A process is defined in 40 CFR 68.3 as any activity involving a regulated substance including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.\r\n\r\nBased on the criteria defining the"

You may also need to submit an additional worst-case scenario for either hazard class (i.e., toxic or flammable), if a worst-case release from elsewhere at your facility would potentially affect a different set of public receptors than those affected by your initial worst-case scenario(s). \r\n\r\n2.

There are no public receptors within the endpoint based on a worst-case release scenario, which was determined to be .47 miles. The Raft River Facility does not use or store regulated toxic substances therefore toxic release scenarios have not been prepared. Flammable substance (isopentane) release scenarios have been evaluated. There are no endpoint receptors located within 3 miles from the facility. The radius of impact from the worst case scenario is .47 miles.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains instruments and equipment to detect potential isopentane leakage and maintains emergency response equipment to remediate potential releases and reduce the potential for fire or explosion. Staff are trained to recognize and respond to potential releases utilizing computer automated control systems.  \r\n\r\nThis is a 5 year old facility with no accident history. All accidents will be documented and investigated in accordance with the plan. Investigations will include an evaluation of the cause of the release and response protocols for the purpose of improving the physical responses and emergency systems that are implemented. \r\n\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \r\nThe offsite consequence analysis is comprised of two elements: (1) worst-case release scenario; and (2) alternative release scenario.

The worst-case release scenario is an analysis of how far away the worst possible accidental release from a facility would affect the surrounding public and environmental receptors.  This analysis is used to determine the facility's program level under the RMP requirements.     \r\nThe EPA model RMP*Comp, version 1.07, was used to calculate the estimated distance to the worst-case flammable endpoint.  Model inputs include chemical type, quantity released, liquid temperature, and mitigation factors.  Isopentane is a flammable liquid and the model defines the worst-case release type as a vapor cloud explosion.  \r\nThe facility uses 183,000 pounds of isopentane within its storage and power generation processes and is the maximum quantity released during the worst-case scenario.  The estimated distance to the overpressure endpoint of one (1) pound per square inch (psi), determined by the RMP*Comp model, is 0.5 miles.  The results of the RMP*Comp modeling assessment were provided in Appendix B of the original document.   \r\nThe radius of impact, as defined by the model, is 0.5 miles from the power generation facility.  The radius of impact is depicted in Figure A-3, provided in Appendix A of the original document.  No residential receptors is located within the radius of impact.    \r\n\r\nTable 4.1 below presents the data used to complete the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.

This type of explosion can occur when a vessel containing a pressurized flammable liquid is ruptured.  The total quantity of isopentane contained at the facility (183,000 pounds) was assumed to be involved in the BLEVE.
