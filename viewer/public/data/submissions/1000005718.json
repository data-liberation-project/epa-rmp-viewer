There have been no chlorine or sulfur dioxide incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\nIn 1994, a Hazardous Chemical Handling Team manual was prepared to safely address handling hazardous chemicals at the Big Buffalo Wastewater Treatment Plant (chlorine and sulfur dioxide). The information in this manual included:\n\no    Written standard operating procedures\n\no    Emergency response procedures \n\no    Leak investigation procedures \n\no    A Chlorine training program including respiratory protection \n\no    Chlorine safety information\n\nStarting in 1999, these additional steps were implemented to complete all requirements for the EPA Risk Management Program.\n\no    Conducting Process Hazards Analyses for the hazardous material processes\n\no    Updating and expanding the Standard Operating Procedures for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Management\n\no    Providing procedures for Management of Change, Incident Investigation and Employee Participation.    \n\no    Expanding the Emergency Response Plan to include offsite response and first aid information\n\no    Revising the site maintenance program to include the chlorine and sulfur dioxide critical equipment.\n\no    Developing Process and Instrumentation Drawings (P&ID) for all processes.\n\no    Conducting refresher training in support of the certification of operators.\n\no    Conducting a Self Audit.\n       \nThe supervisor, chief operator and several plant operators are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the RMP regulation.\n\nIn addition to RMP compliance, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide delivery systems at the plants have been upgraded to vacuum processes over the past 10 years. This process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized "

The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. The Risk Manager for the City also takes an active role in supporting the Utilities Safety Program. \n\nWithin the Utilities department, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n\n- Lockout/Tagout\n\n- Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plants have had an excellent safety record with no recordable injuries over the past three years. As mentioned earlier, there have no reportable chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases from the plant in the last five years.  The city has worked extensively to upgrade its safety program.\n\nReport by:                                                                       \n\n\n\nVictor Czar\nDirector of Public Utilities\n"
