As the operator of a facility at which uncontrolled situations could cause harm to the public and damage to the environment, we will strive for environmental excellence with a commitment to continual improvement, pollution prevention and compliance with legislative requirements.   Employees and supervisors are required to comply with our policies and are subject to corrective action in those cases determined to indicate willful violation. Better Baked Foods, Inc. takes a proactive approach to the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. In consideration of the hazardous effects that Ammonia may have on human health and the environment, the following policies, procedures, and programs have been implemented: a written emergency response plan, an offensively trained and equipped emergency action team in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120,  periodic hazard analysis , safe work practices, initial and periodic training of employees, pre-startup safety reviews, compliance audits, incident investigations, contractor safety program, hot work permit program, mechanical integrity program, preventive maintenance program, continual evaluation for methods to improve facility safety including a standing facility safety committee and participation in the Local Emergency Planning Committee. \n\nA written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program has been developed as a part of our Process Safety Management Program as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119.

This analysis was completed by safety and health staff, engineering, maintenance personnel, and certain operational personnel. The analyses involved a review of each operation of the refrigeration processes to address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. The assessment also included information concerning the emergency action plans related to the process; development and implementation of safe work practices regarding the control of entrance and exit of personnel in the process areas; pre-startup safety; mechanical integrity of equipment; inspection and testing, correction of deficiencies in equipment, planned or unexpected changes to the process, equipment, and procedures to the processes.

For the hazard assessment and the RMP, populations potentially affected are defined as those within a circle that has as its center the point of release and its radius the distance to the toxic endpoint. Owners or operators may use census data to define this population. The presence of schools, hospitals, other institutions, public arenas, recreational areas, and large commercial and industrial developments that can be identified on street maps within this circle must be noted. The presence of environmental receptors within this circle must also be listed. The EPA has defined environmental receptors as natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas, that can be exposed to an accidental release. \n\nBetter Baked Foods, Inc. has had one reportable accident under the guidelines of the Risk Management Program during the past 5 years.  On July 13th, 2000 a mechanical failures resulted in a break in process piping which released 500 pounds of ammonia into an interior cold storage area.
