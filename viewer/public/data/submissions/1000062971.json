      "SummaryText": "Upstate Niagara Cooperative, Inc.'s Dale Road facility (Dale Road) produces various dairy products at our facility located in Cheektowaga, NY. The Dale Road facility has a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. Ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nDale Road takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. Dale Road also has a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. The PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled Ammonia is the only substance covered by the\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.\n\n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAct's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention\n\nprogram consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation Program\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining Program\n\nContractor Safety Program\n\nPre-Startup Safety Revie"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the facility over the past five years that resulted in significant\n\non-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been implemented at the facility. The EAP contains procedures\n\ndescribing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation\n\nprocedures. The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials.\n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWe have identified potential changes to improve the safety of our ammonia refrigeration system. All\n\npotential changes are documented through meeting notes and/or action lists associated with the PSM/RMP\n\nProgram."
