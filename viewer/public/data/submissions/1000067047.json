Bulk liquid totes and smaller trans-filled product containers (bottles or barrels) are stored in the main warehouse area.  Piping is either in double-containment or located within a spill control area and funneled to IWW spill containment via drains/trenches.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Policies and Steps\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's RMP Prevention Program 2 and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  \r\nSome technological safeties and managerial practices in place that help to prevent or limit releases include:\r\na) The use of management of change to ensure the covered process is not altered without a safety review;\r\nb) The existence of IW drain secondary containment;\r\nc)  The existence of manual emergency shutdown system;\r\nd)  the establishment of operator training and operating procedures (SOPs); \r\ne)  the establishment of additional safety training;\r\nf)  the presence of manual isolation valves;\r\ng) the use of a timer on bottle fill to help ensure valves are closed  when bottles are filled;\r\nh) the presence of a scale on MCV fill to help ensure valves close when MCV is filled; and\r\ni) the use of IW drain monitoring for pH by operations personnel for early spill detection.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nAir Liquide's Dallas Chemical Cen"

The Dallas Chemical Center is assisted by the Air Liquide Electronics US LP HAZMAT team.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety\r\nAs is our policy at Air Liquide, we continue to review our process(es) for possible improvements to the process and  operational methods and evaluate new technology to lower risk. The Dallas Chemical Center conducts and resolves all findings from its PHA and other hazard reviews some of which result in modifications of the process. For example, process chemical inventory was reduced by eliminating the bulk HCl storage vessel."
