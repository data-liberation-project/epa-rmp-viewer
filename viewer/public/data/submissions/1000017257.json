This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident protection, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nThe Rocky Mount Gathering System Facility, located approximately 3.5 miles northeast of Rocky Mount in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, produces natural gas liquids from natural gas.  These natural gas liquids are comprised primarily of ethane, pentane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored at the Rocky Mount Gathering System Facility above the EPA Threshold Quantity.  The threshold quantity is the level set by the EPA for each toxic or flammable chemical which if stored at the site requires compliance with the EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  Generally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold quantity, there is little danger to the public.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBecause the process at the Rocky Mount Gathering System Facility which is regulated by the EPA RMP rule is not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, no additional steps for accidental release prevention are required.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the Rocky Mount Gathering System Facility that have occurred in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite effects.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATON\n\n\n\nEmergency response procedu"

This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Rocky Mount Gathering System Facility has a very safe operating history.  However, the facility continually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility.  Our company is very active in promoting coordination between the local emergency response agencies and our facility personnel.  Ongoing communication between our facility and the emergency responders is a integral part of our operations."
