To help ensure the safety of ConocoPhillips operations, the company invests significant resources in accident prevention.  Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes, and operations facilities.  ConocoPhillips's policies and dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help to prevent accidental releases.  If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with the plant's Emergency Preparedness and Crisis Management Response Plan.  \n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Bordovsky Stabilizer, located in Karnes County, Texas, is owned by ConocoPhillips and operated by the ConocoPhillips L48 Department.  The Bordovsky Stabilizer is an oil stabilization plant that recovers and separates hydrocarbon liquids.  Inlet streams from wellhead oil production facilities are delivered via tanker trucks to the plant.  The recovered hydrocarbon liquids are transported via truck offsite for further processing and eventual sales.  The Bordovsky Stabilizer operation includes separation of the inlet stream, stabilization (distillation), storage, trucking and compression.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the Bordovsky Stabilizer's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammabl"

[Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the plant in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity: Ethane-Propane-Butane-Pentane product.  There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe Bordovsky Stabilizer does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the plant does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure for flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  The Ethane-Propane-Butane-Pentane Mix was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of the entire inventory in the largest storage vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\n\n\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantaneously released.  We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors.  In addition"

For the Bordovsky Stabilizer, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a failure on a pump.  \n\n\n\nPassive mitigation systems such as leak detection, gas detection, and emergency shutdown systems would enable the plant to isolate and eliminate such a release within that time-frame.  The alternative release scenario has no off-site impact (i.e., residential populations, industrial, etc.), as determined by the use of the Baker Risk MaxLossTM model, and a review of residences and the adjacent industrial facility. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Bordovsky Stabilizer adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These policies and procedures include and embrace the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements of the Risk Management Program that are currently in operation at the Bordovsky Stabilizer.  The Bordovsky Stabilizer has aligned and integrated its safety management programs at a high level with the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program regulations for consistency and effectiveness.

The Bordovsky Stabilizer has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the plant's processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  The MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure before startup of the modified process or unit that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  Another key purpose of the PSSR's is to ensure that all personnel have been trained on the modification, including any revisions to the operating procedures or to the safety systems and controls.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that all personnel and supporting systems are operationally ready to operate the newly-modified process or equipment.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction, and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention, Process Safety Management Program, and Risk Management Program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Bordovsky Stabilizer has well-established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment in a safe operating condition.
