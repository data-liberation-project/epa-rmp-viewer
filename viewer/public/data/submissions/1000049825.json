This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n- save lives;\n\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n- protect the environment; and\n\n- minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the RMP regulations.  \n\n\n\nDFA - Goshen's personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Maintenance Manager and Safety Representative (Supervisor).  The Supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan. DFA Goshen is coordinated with the Goshen Fire Department and the Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  DFA-Goshen has an excellent safety record in preventing and minimizing releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe DFA - Goshen facility is located at 1110 South 9th Street, in Goshen, Indiana. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with light industrial, commercial and residential areas.\n\n\n\nAmmonia System\n\n\n\nThe primary business of the DFA - Goshen facility is the processing of milk and cream.  In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 14,000 pounds of ammonia in its ammonia refrigeration system, but may increase based on facility need.  The refrigeration sy"

Typical operating conditions range from approximately 25 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 175 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  This prevention program covers the process that handles ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\n- Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n\n- In depth process hazard analysis are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n\n- Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n\n- Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n\n- Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n\n- A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which inclu"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n-On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n-Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or that meet the definition above.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nDFA - Goshen is a \"non-responding\" facility. The facility is included in the community emergency response plan. Their role is to immediately call 911, Plant Manager and Maintenance Supervisor while waiting for the Fire Department and appropriate responders to arrive at the scene.

The PHA Revalidation study included a HAZOP process using Guidewords / checklists and a facility inspection.  The PHA Revalidation provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the DFA - Goshen facility located at 1110 South 9th Street in Goshen, Indiana.  As a result of the PHA Revalidation, a number of recommendations were made, such as some equipment upgrades and improvement of existing safety procedures and piping diagrams.  All recommendations resultant from the revalidation study are due to be completed by March 31, 2016.\n\n\n\nThe DFA - Goshen safety committee is also planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.    Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.    Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.    Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.
