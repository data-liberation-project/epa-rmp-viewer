      "SummaryText": "Winchester Municipal Utilities Water Treatment Plant, located a 365 Water Works Road, Winchester, KY, has one independent chlorine injection system.  The chlorine storage is located outdoors.  The chlorination process is located inside the chlorine process building.  In the process room, the system has one (1) one-ton cylinder of chlorine on-line and one (1) one-ton cylinder of chlorine on standby at any one time.  The system is operated under vacuum using gaseous chlorine.  There is a Vacuum Regulator-Check Unit (Wallace & Tiernan 500 lb/24 hour capacity) which automatically shuts off the cylinder in the event of a break in the vacuum line.  The chlorine supply system can automatically switch between the on-line and standby chlorine containers when the on-line container is depleted.\r\n\r\nThe Facility has a chlorine detector to monitor leakage in the chlorinator area.  A chlorine sensor is located at about twelve (12) inches above floor level.  The detector will automatically alarm at the Faciltiy and at the main control room panel.\r\n\r\nThe Facility normally stores a maximum of six (6) one-ton cylinders at the site at any one time.  All cylinders not in use are stored outdoors in a fenced enclosure.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area and the cylinders are taken off the truck via crane and placed upon the dock.\r\n\r\nNormally, the chlorinator room is secured with doors that remain closed and locked except when the system is being inspected.  Inspection takes place daily.  If a chlorine leak is detected, the chlorine alarm will sound.  The alarm has two detection levels.  A warning level of 3 parts per million (ppm) and high alarm level of 5 ppm.  If the alarm sounds, the Operator will notify the Plant Chief Operator and appoint a Standby Operator.  If the warning alarm is indicated, the Operator will investigate the cause for the alarm.  The Standby will remain outdoors in contact with the Operator, ready to call for outside assi"

The air inside the building is exhausted and fresh air is drawn into the building through upper and lower vents, respectively.  The Operator and Standby are trained in chlorine safety and emergency procedures.  The Operator will shut the chlorine cylinder if possible.  If the leakage is not stopped, the local emergency responder (Clark County Fire Department and City of Winchester Fire Department) will be immediately contacted by dialing 911 and all Water Treatment Plant personel will follow the Emergency Response Plan as outlined by Winchester Municipal Utilities and move to the rendezvous point.  The exhaust system will be shut down to try and contain the leak inside the building.  If the high alarm level is sounded, the local emergency responder ( Clark County Fire Department) will be immediately contacted.\r\n\r\nThe Facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine from this covered process in the five years prior to the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP)."
