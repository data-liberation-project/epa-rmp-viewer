The commitment is demonstrated by an accidental release program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at the facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Facility and Regulated Processes\r\nCordova Energy Company's primary activity is the generation of electric energy by combustion of natural gas.  Part of that activity involves the use of a system that provides aqueous ammonia for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) in the heat recovery steam generators.  The aqueous ammonia storage and forwarding system (the process) consists of a storage tank, two forwarding pumps, associated piping, valves, and instrumentation.  Atomized ammonia is sprayed on to the SCR section.  The flue gas entrains the ammonia and as the mixture passes through the SCR, it undergoes a reaction that reduces nitrogen oxides to meet environmental regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of aqueous ammonia in the process is 55,902 gallons (418,145 pounds).  In the storage tank, ammonia is concentrated at 29% in water.\r\n\r\nWe determined that there are no public receptors within the worst-case or alternative release scenarios endpoint distances and there is no history of releases of regulated substances.  Therefore, this process qualifies for Program Level 1.  The off site consesquence analysis performed as part of this re-submittal was completed using EPA's RMP*Comp(TM)software.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68"

      "SummaryText": "for Program Level 1 processes.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with appropriate engineering and nationally recognized design standards.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nCordova Energy Company believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.   Cordova Energy Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\nCordova Energy Company has developed a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes aspects of emergency response including notifications of local emergency response agencies and the public, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and post-incident decontamination of infected areas.  We do not maintain an emergency response capability within the facility for major incidents; the emergency response plan calls for notification of outside assistance in dealing with hazardous materials incidents.\r\n\r\nTo insure proper functioning, our release detection, routine monitoring and emergency equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  Also, the emergency response plan is routinely reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect pertinent changes taking place within t"

      "SummaryText": "he processes that would require amended emergency response measures.\r\n\r\nOur emergency plan is coordinated with The Rock Island County Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (the Local Emergency Planning Committee or LEPC) and the Village of Cordova Fire Department.  The telephone number of the LEPC is (309) 799-5166.\r\n\r\nRMP Certification\r\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the following process is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor: [Aqueous Ammonia Selective Catalyst Reduction System]. Within the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The person responsible for RMP implementation certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete."
