Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The LAAFP facilities chlorine handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  LADWP prepared and submitted the RMPs for the LAAFP facilities in June 1999, June 2004, and June 2009. Subsequent to the preparation of the Risk Management Plan in June 2009, the facility was modified and two additional chlorination processes at the LAAFP complex (Van Norman Chloramination Station 1; VNCS#1) and Van Norman Chloramination Station 2; VNCS#2) were added. This Risk Management Plan is an update of the document prepared in 2009. \n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n\n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n\n* Emergency respo"

The above information for the five LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant facilities is provided below.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe LADWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LAAFP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).

The 90-ton railcar is the largest vessel (container) on line. \n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station serves to chlorinate water in a single 120\" diameter pipeline exiting the reservoir.  The treated water is then piped into the distribution network which serves much of the San Fernando Valley with potable water and feeds other reservoirs.  It also chlorinates the outlet flow from the Van Norman Bypass Reservoir and another pipeline called the Rinaldi Trunk Line.  This station stores chlorine in a 25-ton bulk storage tank; it can also store one-ton chlorine containers to be used when the bulk tank is taken out of service for maintenance or repair. The 25-ton bulk tank is the largest vessel (container) on line. \n\n\n\nThe Van Norman Chemical Depot is used for storage of unopened one-ton chlorine containers and 150-lb cylinders in addition to various other chemicals.   The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on-site.  The depot is equipped with a one-ton capacity dry media chlorine scrubber which is activated in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\n\n\nThe Van Norman Chloramination Station #1 is used to establish a chloramine residual in the treated water. The chlorine storage system consists of two banks of one-ton containers plus additional spare ton-containers. The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on-site. Each of the containers in the two feed banks are equipped with Halogen Systems valve actuators that automatically close the ton-container feed valve when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room. The spare ton-containers are not equipped with these actuators, as these containers cannot be connected to the process in the storage location.\n\n\n\nThe station is equipped with a dry media chlorine scrubber system with a capacity of 4,700 lbs of chlorine.
