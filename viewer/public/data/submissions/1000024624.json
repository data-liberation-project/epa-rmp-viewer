      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The LAAFP facilities chlorine handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  LADWP prepared and submitted the RMPs for the LAAFP facilities in June 1999, June 2004, and June 2009. Subsequent to the preparation of the Risk Management Plan in June 2009, the facility was modified and two additional chlorination processes at the LAAFP complex (Van Norman Chloramination Station 1; VNCS#1) and Van Norman Chloramination Station 2; VNCS#2) were added. This Risk Management Plan is an update of the document prepared in 2009. \r\n\r\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \r\n\r\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\r\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\r\n* Five-year accident history summary.\r\n* Emergency respo"

For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and Compliance Audit Checklist forms (one form for each prevention program requirement).  The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader.  The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element and contains questions that may assist with the auditing process. The audit checklist for each element consists of the following three sections:\r\n\r\n* Records Review: A review of the RMP written Prevention Program.\r\n* On-Site Conditions: The audit team will review the program elements based on observation of the plant conditions and safety practices.\r\n* Interviews:  The program elements will be evaluated by interviewing personnel from appropriate functions including operations, maintenance, management, and contractors.\r\n\r\nTeam members record RMP program deficiencies identified during the audit on the checklist.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe LADWP incident investigation procedures describe incident reporting, investigation, and investigation reporting steps to be followed by plant personnel.

      "SummaryText": "In addition, LADWP ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after major modifications.  \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nLADWP Contractor procedures specify the information required to be provided to the contractors performing work on or near the chlorination processes, the training requirements for contractor employees, and mechanism to obtain assurance from contractors that they have informed their employees of the appropriate safety rules.  LADWP provides information and explanations concerning the hazards and processes. \r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\r\n\r\nLADWP has procedures in place to ensure that a pre-startup safety review is conducted prior to starting a new covered process or prior to making modifications to the chlorination systems.  The required conditions prior to startup include:\r\n\r\n* Construction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications.\r\n* Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.\r\n* A PHA has been performed for any new facilities and recommendations have been resolved or implemented prior to startup.\r\n* At modified facilities, MOC requirements have been met.\r\n* Training of each operating and maintenance employee involved in the process is complete.\r\n\r\nThese procedures ensure that no new/significantly modified process will start-up and no regulated substances will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review.  This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to go and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately addressed.  This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process is safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate. \r\n\r\nMechanical integrity procedures for the plant ensure that written maintenance procedures are implemented and documented, including training of maintenance personnel."

      "SummaryText": "Maintenance\r\n\r\nLADWP operates a maintenance management program that generates task orders for performance of preventive maintenance after a designated time past the closing of the previous task order for that maintenance.  Description of the work to be performed is included with the printed work order.  The water treatment supervisor is responsible for this task.\r\n\r\nIn addition, written maintenance procedures are provided in the Operation and Maintenance Manual as follows: Preventive maintenance schedules are provided which summarize inspection, test, and maintenance schedules on a daily, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, biannual, annual, every 2 to 10 years, and as-needed basis.  These allow the operator to rapidly review what maintenance is necessary.  The schedules are supplemental to the log sheets on-site and provide a summary and quick reference to manufacturer's O&M manuals.  A maintenance log book is provided on-site for quick reference by the Operator.\r\n\r\nLADWP documents inspection, testing, and maintenance of chlorination equipment and assures the performance is done in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer and industry groups (i.e., Chlorine Institute).\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \r\n\r\nHot work refers to work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark producing operations.  The procedures call for the issuance of a hot work permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorination processes and other areas deemed appropriate as described in the procedures.  Fire prevention and protection systems are in place prior to the issuance of the hot work permit.  The permit indicates the dates the work is authorized for, the location and specific operational requirements and is kept on file in the administrative office. \r\n\r\nLADWP Management of Change (MOC) procedures include steps required to be taken by plant personnel prior to implementing changes to chlorination equipment, procedures, raw mater"

In the event an accidental release that could result in offsite consequences occurs, external resources such as the City of Los Angeles Fire Department will be solicited to respond as well.  \r\n\r\nAs part of the emergency response program, the LADWP has developed and implemented an emergency response plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment. The following elements are included:\r\n\r\n(a)\tAn emergency response plan, maintained at the stationary source and at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) containing:\r\n* Organizational structure (chain-of-command) and responsibilities of various LADWP personnel.\r\nProcedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations.\r\n* Details of the training programs for all employees involved with the chlorination process, contractor training, and medical surveillance of LADWP personnel who respond to chlorine releases.\r\n* Details of emergency recognition and prevention at the LADWP.\r\n* Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.\r\n* Documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures and the detailed information on emergency health care.\r\n* Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release.\r\n\r\n(b)\tProcedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance. \r\n(c)\tTr"
