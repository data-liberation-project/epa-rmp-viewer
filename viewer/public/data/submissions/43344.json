THE FACILITY IS EQUIPPED WITH AMMONIA DETECTORS IN CRITICAL AREAS \nOF THE PLANT THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN AMMONIA LEAK WILL SOUND ALARMS AND AUTOMATICALLY START EXHAUST FANS. THE COMPRESSOR ROOM IS EQUIPPED WITH AN AMMONIA ABSORBTION TANK THAT IN THE EVENT OF A SAFETY VALVE RELEASE OR FAILURE THE AMMONIA WILL NOT REACH ANY OFF SITE RECEPTORS AND BE CONTAINED WITHIN THE WATER TANK. THE OTTAWA COUNTY EMERGENCY SERVICES DEPARTMENT IS COORDINATED WITH THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT AND IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY \nSITUATION, THEY WILL IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HOLLAND FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS, ALERT THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AS TO THE EXTENT OF THE RELEASE. BOAR'S HEAD HAS GONE TO EXTENSIVE LENGTHS TO PUT IN PLACE EXTRA SAFEGUARDS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY FROM OFFSITE RELEASES. THE IMMEDIATE GOAL IN A SPECIFIC INCIDENT IS ASSURING THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF BOAR'S HEAD EMPLOYEES AND RENDERING AID TO THOSE IN NEED. IT IS ALSO \nTHE GOAL OF THE BOAR'S HEAD HAZMAT TEAM TO CONTROL THE SITUATION AND CLEAN UP THE CONTAMINATED AREA BEFORE IT HARMS THE ENVIRONMENT OR THE SURROUNDING COMMINUNITY.

We \nroutinely train all of the staff on process safety as well as lockout tagout, hazcom, \nand food safety. We have located ammonia detectors in all areas where there is a risk \nfor an ammonia leak, we have engineered in controls and a water absorbtion system in \nthe event of a multiple system failure, will contain any ammonia that would be \ndischarged through the relief valve vent lines. The training that we utilize for the \noperators of our ammonia refrigeration system consists of hands on, books and computer \nassisted training. We continuously monitor and audit our PSM system in order to prevent \nmechanical or operational failures of our system."
