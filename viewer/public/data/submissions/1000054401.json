At this terminal, we load, unload, store and handle propane.  The management has adopted and implemented policies and procedures that adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  The most current editions of NFPA 58 and 54 are followed for the safe handling of propane and the installation and maintenance of storage equipment.  Safety is the number one consideration in the handling of propane, the design and maintainace of the equipment, and the training of our personnel.  The Certified Employee Training Program (CETP) modules relating to the maintenance procedures of bulk storage containers and equipment and the modules relating to basic Plant operation and performing railcar product transfers and maintain DOT intermodal (IM) tanks, is the guide for safety at this terminal, provided and accredited by the Propane Education and Research Council & the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA).\n\nOur emergency response plan is based upon the \"Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures \"and \"How to Control Gas Leaks and Fires. Terminal staff will not respond to accidental releases of flammable substances at our facility, but has coordinated response actions with the local fire departments.  Our response plan includes procedures to call local emergency responders such as the fire and local law enforcement departments, as well as any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this terminal is propane.  The purpose of this facility is to store propane for distribution to wholesale customers.  Most of the propane is received by railcar and stored in 16 large storage tanks. Up to 100 full railcars may also be stored onsite at any"

It is set up to load transports, bobtail's retail cylinders and Auto gas; however the majority of the propane is loaded into transports that haul the propane to wholesale customers.  This facility does not sell propane to the general public.  The installation of the storage tanks and the loading and unloading equipment has been done according to the provisions of NFPA 58.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis terminal complies with all Federal and state rules and regulations that govern the storage, handling and transportation of propane. It also complies with the EPA'S Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  The terminal was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA 58 code for the storage and handling of propane.  Periodic inspection of the entire system is done to ensure continued safe operations.  All maintenance and improvements are done per the latest NFPA code in effect at the time.  Regulatory authorities, to insure that it is operated and maintained properly, inspect this terminal.  The employees are trained as required by the appropriate codes and regulations using the \"Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety:\n\nThe Terminal was constructed and is maintained in compliance with NFPA 58. The staff has been trained using the Certified Employee Training g Program developed by the National Propane Gas Association in addition to industry safety practices and procedures. Department of transportation personnel have trained the staff in safety procedures for unloading railcars. Safety practices are continually reviewed. Equipment and maintenance programs are monitored on an ongoing basis. \n\n"
