Box 65\nHopkins, Missouri  64461\n660-778-3322\nFor further information, contact:  Mark Hoover, manager\n\nTHE FACILITY POLICY\nThe owners, management and employees of River Valley Ag are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 90,000 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of 2 semi trailer loads holding 40,000 pounds.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank, as a gas, over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 76,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is miles.\n\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is miles.\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe facility has implemented the provision of \"Safety Requirments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhyd"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,

      "SummaryText": "rous ammonia\".\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has:\n     - a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n     - provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information \n        as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n     - A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 2 CFR 1910.120, \n        including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are not additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
