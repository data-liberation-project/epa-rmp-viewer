(SHN), on behalf of The Humboldt Creamery Association (HCA).  This Program has been compiled for the HCA Facility, in accordance with the Cal ARP Program requirements which are specified in the California Code of Regulations (CCR Title 19, Division, Chapter 4.5), OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards (Section 5189 of Title 8 of CCR, or Code of Federal Regulations Title 29, Section 1910.119), and EPA\u0012s Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68).\n\nThe HCA facility is owned and operated by The Humboldt Creamery Association, and is located at Fernbridge, Humboldt County, California (Figure 1).  Anhydrous ammonia is being used in the cooling and refrigeration systems. \n\nThe following plan covers the HCA Facility, and its processes (Figure 2).  The format used in producing this plan come directly from the Cal ARP Program guidelines for completing Risk Management Plans.\n\n\n1.0\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Humboldt Creamery Association (HCA) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the HCA workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, HCA has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at this HCA facility.  Additionally, this RMP complies with all requirements Cal ARP, the OSHA PSM standards, and the EPA RMP Rule.\n\nThe risk management program at HCA consists of three elements:\n\n1.\tA hazard assessment to help understand the potential on- and off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and accidents that have occurred during the past five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshol"

The systems are continually monitored by a microprocessor, and can be remotely monitored and controlled, as required.\n\n The facility, equipment, systems, and controls were carefully designed, and constructed to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nThe safety program at HCA consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at HCA that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHCA is committed to safety, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  HCA implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include; training for key employees to respond appropriately to an accidental release; coordination with the Eureka Fire Department (Hazardous Materials Response Team), local fire departments, the Humboldt County Division of Environmental Health, and other similar facilities, to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur if a release does occur; and establishing inspection and evaluation programs to identify potential hazards.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, HCA will assess the situation, and together with the local fire departments and the Hazardous Materials Response Team (HMRT), they will control and contain the releases in a manner that will be s"

HCA has designated an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and will continue to coordinate its response efforts with the local fire departments and the HMRT.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, HCA established a management system headed by the Operations Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2\tHCA\u0012s Regulated Substances Handled and Source Information\n\nAs part of the facility\u0012s cooling and refrigeration systems, anhydrous ammonia is used and stored in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the Cal ARP Program, EPA RMProgram, and OSHA PSM regulations.  The federal threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, and the facility contains approximately 30,000 pounds.\n\n1.3\tOff-site Consequence Analysis\n\nHCA performed an off-site analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance that could adversely affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  HCA does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur; therefore, alternative release scenarios were selected to assist in improving the emergency response plan.  Alternative release scenarios represent a release that might occur at a facility like HCA\u0012s, and would result in the greatest potential off-site consequences if the release occurred.  \n The main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance. At the distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater: at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a to"

The mechanical integrity program includes; inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, and a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in each process.\n\n1.5.5  Pre-startup Review.  HCA performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  A pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n1.5.6  Management of Change.  The HCA management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n1.5.7  Compliance Audit.  HCA audits cover the processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the operations.  HCA assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirement of the RMP rule, and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements are implemented.\n\n 1.5.8  Incident Investi"

The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n1.5.9  Employee Participation.  HCA has developed an employee participation program for the covered process to help ensure that the safety concerns of the workers are addressed.  HCA encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of the covered process at the facility.  Employees are consulted and informed about specific aspects of the RMP, including PHAs and operating procedures.\n\n1.5.10  Hot Work Permits.  HCA established a hot work permit program to control spark or flame producing activities that could results in fires or explosions in covered process areas of the facility.  OSHA\u0012s fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) were reviewed, and a hot work permit form is included to comply with these requirements.

The contractor supervisors are required to have trained employees that will work in and around the ammonia process areas.\n\n1.6\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, HCA has implemented safety features specific to the facility ammonia process areas.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\n\nThe facility has been updated and meets the requirements necessary for operating in a safety manner.  \n\nWhen ammonia is needed for filling the system, it is transported into the facility, and is pumped to the storage container using all required handling procedures.  When transporting, and filling the tanks, transfer procedures are strictly adhered to.  Only trained personnel will complete the transfer process.  Additionally, an HCA personnel is present during the filling process.\n\nPermaCold Engineering, Inc., (800)455-8585, provided the engineering design, drawings, specifications, and operation manuals for specific ammonia processes.  They have the necessary experience in designing systems that meet the applicable codes. \n\n Process Cooling (Vic Dervin (408)996-0595, provided piping and control system designs, and operational procedures for specific ammonia processes at the facility.  They have the necessary experience in designing systems that meet the applicable codes.

Detectors have an audible alarm as well as having a light that goes on to warn workers entering that space.  The control room has a light that is energized when one of the remote sensors or lights are energized, and the control room is occupied 24 hours per day.\n\nAll tanks, piping systems, and supports have been designed and installed to meet the appropriate seismic requirements.  The surrounding structures were also seismically designed.  Flex connectors are used at locations where excessive movement can occur between the tank and the secured piping.  The cylinders are located within areas that will secure them from large objects which could fall and damage the cylinders or supply systems.  The cylinders are located inside a fire proof structure.  \n\n1.7\tFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents reported in the last five years, with regard to a significant release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an incident occurs, then an investigation team will be assembled to follow the incident investigation protocol.  The team will suggest improvements to the process and, if appropriate, improvements will be made. \n\n1.8\tEmergency Response Program \n\nHCA has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of ammonia.
