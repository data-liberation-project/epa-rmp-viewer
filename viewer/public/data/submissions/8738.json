(SHN), on behalf of The Humboldt Creamery Association (HCA).  This Program has been compiled for the HCA Facility, in accordance with the Cal ARP Program requirements which are specified in the California Code of Regulations (CCR Title 19, Division, Chapter 4.5), OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards (Section 5189 of Title 8 of CCR, or Code of Federal Regulations Title 29, Section 1910.119), and EPAs Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68).\n\nThe HCA facility is owned and operated by The Humboldt Creamery Association, and is located at Fernbridge, Humboldt County, California (Figure 1).  Anhydrous ammonia is being used in the cooling and refrigeration systems. \n\nThe following plan covers the HCA Facility, and its processes (Figure 2).  The format used in producing this plan come directly from the Cal ARP Program guidelines for completing Risk Management Plans.\n\n\n1.0    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Humboldt Creamery Association (HCA) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the HCA workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, HCA has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at this HCA facility.  Additionally, this RMP complies with all requirements Cal ARP, the OSHA PSM standards, and the EPA RMP Rule.\n\nThe risk management program at HCA consists of three elements:\n\n1.    A hazard assessment to help understand the potential on- and off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and accidents that have occurred during the past five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n2.    A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshol"

An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan), and the HCA Ammonia Refrigeration System Procedures Manual.\n\nThis HCA facility and ammonia process have recently been upgraded, and meet or exceed the standards.  The systems are continually monitored by a microprocessor, and can be remotely monitored and controlled, as required.\n\n The facility, equipment, systems, and controls were carefully designed, and constructed to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nThe safety program at HCA consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at HCA that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHCA is committed to safety, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  HCA implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include; training for key employees to respond appropriately to an accidental release; coordination with the Eureka Fire Department (Hazardous Materials Response Team), local fire departments, the Humboldt County Division of Environmental Health, and other similar facilities, to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur if a release does occur; and establishing inspection and evaluation programs to identify potential hazards.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, HCA will assess the situation, and together with the local fire departments and the Hazardous Materials Response Team (HMRT), they will control and contain the releases in a manner that will be s"

HCA has designated an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and will continue to coordinate its response efforts with the local fire departments and the HMRT.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, HCA established a management system headed by the Operations Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2    HCAs Regulated Substances Handled and Source Information\n\nAs part of the facilitys cooling and refrigeration systems, anhydrous ammonia is used and stored in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the Cal ARP Program, EPA RMProgram, and OSHA PSM regulations.  The federal threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, and the facility contains approximately 30,000 pounds.\n\n1.3    Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nHCA performed an off-site analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance that could adversely affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  HCA does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur; therefore, alternative release scenarios were selected to assist in improving the emergency response plan.  Alternative release scenarios represent a release that might occur at a facility like HCAs, and would result in the greatest potential off-site consequences if the release occurred.  \n The main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance. At the distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater: at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a to"

These documents address the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the HCA facility, operating parameters of the systems, and equipment operating procedures for these processes.  HCA ensures that this process safety information is available.\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the HCA facility, including anhydrous ammonia (liquid and gas phases used in the ammonia processes at the facility.  The MSDS information available for a hazardous substance typically includes;:\n\n7 toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\n7 physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point\n7 reactivity and corrosivity data\n7 thermal and chemical stability data\n7 hazards of mixing substances in the process\n\nMSDSs for the hazardous substance handled (anhydrous ammonia) are available so that the operators and employees have ready reference to this information.  In addition, MSDSs are provided to the emergency response teams for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.\n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and configuration of the equipment in each covered process (See Operations and Maintenance Manuals).  When important information is not available from the design documents, it is developed through special projects or, in the case of operating parameters, during the process hazards analyses of the process.  In June of 1999, HCA developed their Ammonia Refrigeration System Procedures Manual  to help with the safe operation of the process.  This document is used to train employees, to perform process hazards analyses, and to help maintain the equipment.\n\n1.5.1  Process Hazard Analysis.  HCA performs and periodically updates the Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes, which will help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.

HCA primarily uses a PHA checklist to perform the analysis.  In June of 1999, the PHA team prepared a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations was assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the processes will be implemented.\n\n 1.5.2  Operating Procedures.  HCAs Operations Manager, Maintenance Supervisor, and maintenance crew work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operation and process upsets.\n\nHCA personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.\n\n1.5.3  Training.  HCA provides training for workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program include both initial and refresher training that covers a general overview of the process, the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.\n\nThe maintenance personnel and operators are consulted annually at a safety meeting to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Recommendations from the maintenance personnel and operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\n1.5.4  Mechanical Integrity.

The mechanical integrity program includes; inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, and a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in each process.\n\n1.5.5  Pre-startup Review.  HCA performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  A pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n1.5.6  Management of Change.  The HCA management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n1.5.7  Compliance Audit.  HCA audits cover the processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the operations.  HCA assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirement of the RMP rule, and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements are implemented.\n\n 1.5.8  Incident Investi"

HCA investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  HCA provides training to the employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n1.5.9  Employee Participation.  HCA has developed an employee participation program for the covered process to help ensure that the safety concerns of the workers are addressed.  HCA encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of the covered process at the facility.  Employees are consulted and informed about specific aspects of the RMP, including PHAs and operating procedures.\n\n1.5.10  Hot Work Permits.  HCA established a hot work permit program to control spark or flame producing activities that could results in fires or explosions in covered process areas of the facility.  OSHAs fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) were reviewed, and a hot work permit form is included to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the hot work permit form.  The shift supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the hot work permit form is included in the HCA safe work practices orientation.\n\n1.5.11  Contractors.
