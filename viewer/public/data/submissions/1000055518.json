We produce chickens that are farm raised, cage free and fed a diet that is predominantly corn and soy-based with no added hormones. The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains anhydrous ammonia in a quantity greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\n\n\nCase Farms has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\n\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.\n\n\n\nCase Farms has organized the information and polices pertaining to the process into a complete library consisting of five numbered volumes, as well as reference materials.

The ERC or Alternate has complete authority to commit all available resources in the event of an emergency. In the event that none of the listed personnel are on-site, the senior management person shall direct operations until the ERC or Alternate arrives on-site.\n\nThe ERC and alternates are responsible for emergency response coordination with state and local agencies on a 24-hour basis. Upon notification of an existing, or imminent emergency situation, the ERC will immediately identify the character, exact source, amount and extent (area) of the emergency.\n\n\n\nThe ERC will assess possible hazards both direct and indirect to human health, the environment and/or property both inside and outside of the plant. After this information is received, a decision is made whether or not to implement the provisions of the Emergency Response Plan. Upon enactment of the Emergency Response Plan, the ERC will be responsible for:\n\n\n\nDetermination of the need for a plant evacuation, or Sheltering in Place;\n\nNotification of appropriate governmental agencies and off-site responders;\n\nNotification of appropriate corporate personnel.\n\nDocumentation during and reporting after an emergency situation.\n\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given and the Off-site Incident Commander "
