Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at North Iowa Cooperative Elevator  in Mason City, Iowa are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Nora Springs Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in a 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Mason City.  The maximum amount stored is 78,795 pounds at the maximum fill capacity of 85 %.  We also have nurse tank volume of 77,768 pounds for a total possible storage of 155,563 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  The following details of these scenarios.\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank (778795 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a rural topography, the maximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.2 miles.\nThe alternat"

The scenario involves the release of 9887.39 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.31 miles.\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.Process Safety Information\nThe North Iowa Coop Elevator maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameter,s and equipment designs associated with all processes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\nOperating Procedures\nThe North Iowa Coop Elevator maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation;  the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nThe North Iowa Coop Elevator has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\nMechanical Integrity\nThe North Iowa Coop Elevator conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems,"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the North Iowa Coop Elevator to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\nPre-startup Reviews\nThe North Iowa Coop Elevator routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\nCompliance Audits\nThe North Iowa Coop Elevator conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\nEmployee Participation\nThe North Iowa Coop Elevator truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nThe North Iowa Coop Elevator has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n  6. Emergency Response Plan\nThe North Iowa Coop Elevator maintains a written emergency response plan to deal wit"
