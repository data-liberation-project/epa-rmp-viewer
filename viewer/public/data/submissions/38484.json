Facility Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of Northern Country Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Dept., or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 360,706 pounds.  There is one 18,000 gallon tank, two 11,000 gallon tanks, twenty-five 1,000 gallon nurse tanks, and twelve 1,450 gallon tanks.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\nA. The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the gas release of the total contents of a storage tank over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 78,795 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is .94 mile.\n\nB. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 1 1/2 inch pipe.  The distance to the endpoint is .46 mile.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Hanlding of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  In addition, Minnesota Dept. Ag Rules.\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History\nA. There have been no acci"

The emergency response program at this facility consists of:\n* A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n* Provided State and local authorities, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know information required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n*Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia recommendations for implementation at this time."
