To ensure that our water remains safe throughout the distribution system to every tap, the plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent.  The concentrated form of chlorine is liquefied and stored in shipping containers.  Before it is mixed with water, chlorine can be extremely hazardous if released to the air.\n\n\nMissouri American Water Company has delivered quality drinking water to its customers for 100 years.  The MAWC Blendville Plant, located in Joplin, Missouri, serves customers in the Joplin area and has the capacity to produce 17 million gallons of drinking water per day.  Chlorine, a disinfectant used in the water treatment process, is covered under OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  MAWC complies with these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that the risks involved in the handling, use and storage of chlorine are minimized.  It is MAWC\u00bfs policy to conduct our business in accordance with applicable environmental, safety and health laws and regulations.  Management fully supports efforts to safely manage process risks to prevent incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment.  In conducting our business, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.  We promote continuous improvement through business planning, ongoing training, and constant oversight of operations.  We take safety seriously and have comprehensive accident prevention and emergency planning and response programs in place.  MAWC\u00bfs Environmental Policy emphasizes \u00bfcontinuous improvement of our environmental performance\u00bf while providing our services in a manner that prevents pollution and promotes sustainability.  \n\nCHLORINE SYSTEM\n\nChlorine is us"

Missouri American Water Company (MAWC) has safely used chlorine as part of our water treatment process since the early 1900\u00bfs.  We continue to operate well within the guidelines set by EPA and other regulatory authorities.  Due to the hazards of chlorine, however, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in order to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMissouri American Water Company (MAWC) has a comprehensive prevention program in place, which ensures safe operation of the system and prevention of accidental releases.  The chlorine system at the plant is designed for safety.  We follow Chlorine Institute Standards and use only equipment and materials certified for chlorine service.  Excess flow, remote isolation, and safety relief valves, as well as a vacuum system, are utilized to prevent leaks.  A process hazard analysis is performed and reviewed regularly to identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with the chlorine system.  Procedures and systems are in place to operate safely.  Comprehensive operating procedures provide clear instructions for safe operation of the chlorine system.  Process safety information is available to all employees and includes information related to chlorine hazards, such as Material Safety Data Sheets, process technology, and process equipment.   Operators are formally trained to operate the chlorine process safely, and receive classroom as well as on-the-job instruction.  Procedures are followed to ensure proper management of changes to the system and a safety review is performed prior to startup of new or modified equipment.  The facility is staffed 24 hours per day and the process is continuously monitored using state-of-the-art computerized instrumentation and operator oversight.  En"
