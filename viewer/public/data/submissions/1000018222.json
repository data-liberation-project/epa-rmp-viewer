This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.

In addition, it is the company's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nOne of our company goals states, To provide for the Safety of our employees, our customers, the general public and to be good stuarts of the environment for which we serve.  To fulfill these goals , we enroll in the regulatory management services that assists in maintaining and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs, procedures and training courses.  We now perform a thorough annual audit and monitor facility compliance with safety standards as overseen by the speciality firm.  The program consists of an internal audit utilizing checklists survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local regulations are complied with.  These checklists are used to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.

We sell anhydrous ammonia to growers in nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a needed source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia is also used for blending into mixed grade liquid fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nOur facility maintains 6-1,000 gallon nurse tanks and 15- 1500 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 28,505 lbs. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 30,000 gallon or 154,000 lbs. stationary storage tank on site.  Threfore the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for this facility is 182,700 lbs.  The largest storage vessel at our facility contains 154,200 lbs.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n                                                                                                                                                                                         Our worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity by law), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 154,200 lbs.  According to DEGADIS modeling, the distance to the end-point (Point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted that our company has never had a total relesae of an entire storage tank.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario           \n\nThe most common alternate release scenario from an anhydrous ammonia storage facilitry would not reach an end-point off-site.  The alternate release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a three minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve-end hose failure requiring a manual shutdown.

This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 Standards, 1989 Edition, OSHA 29CRF1910.111 Standards,  EPA accidental release prevention rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n \nOur ammonia stystem is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves and manual shut-offs.  The loadout risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line break-aways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose would fail.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.  Lighting for the facility has increased to discourage the increase of meth theft.\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventative maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, guages, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines within the ANSI Standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever compentency with the regulations are questioned.  In accordance with the 1989 ANSI Standards, training is also offered for all ammonia customers to attend on a regular basis and offered to the local fire department personnel during their annual tour of our facility and operations.  These training courses consist of classroom lector, current and approved videos or compact disc, testing both verablly and written demonstrations and observations for each person working with the process that are certified;  while on go"
