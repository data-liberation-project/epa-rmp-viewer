      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe facility produces pasteurized milk, drink, and juice products. The facility operates an anhydrous\n\nammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment\n\ncooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of\n\nmultiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use\n\nof operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety\n\nperformance: and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to\n\nmonitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require. Major\n\nequipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers and other storage vessels,\n\npurgers, and a variety of heat exchanges (evaporators, air handlers, etc.)\n\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. \n\n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.

Five-Year Accident History \n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the facility over the past five years that resulted in significant onsite or offsite consequences.\n\n \n\n \n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program \n\nReiter Dairy- Springfield has an Emergency Action plan in place, which describes how the facility will respond to an ammonia release and other emergencies. The plan includes First Aid procedures, Emergency Medical Treatment procedures, Evacuation plans, Notification / Communication and Re-entry procedures, and Training and Drill programs.\n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas, as well as within the anhydrous\n\nammonia refrigeration system. The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance\n\npersonnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential\n\nimprovements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personnel in the areas of safety\n\nand environmental awareness, compliance, and response. Future changes to improve release prevention include addition of new technology as it becomes available, and continued training of plant personnel. \n\n"
