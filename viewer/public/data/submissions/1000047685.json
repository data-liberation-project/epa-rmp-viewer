The liquids are then separated from the gas stream and further split into an ethane/propane product and a light gasoline/condensate product and removed from the plant by pipeline. The remaining natural gas is also removed by pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe Texas City Extraction Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity. Based on process knowledge, the Texas City Extraction Plant identified regulated substances and quantities kept on site. Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Texas City Extraction Plant are propane and light gasoline/condensate. Based on worst-case analysis, distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Texas City Extraction Plant is subject to the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management. Therefore, the Texas City Extraction Plant is subject to Program 3.\r\n\r\nProcess Controls are in place at the facility to prevent or minimize an emergency release, including various automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment. In addition, the facility is equipped with UV/IR detection and LEL/HAM (Hazardous Atmosphere Monitors).\r\n\r\nUnder EPA requirements, the worst-case scenario (WCS) assumes weather conditions that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  Based on these assumptions, the WCS vapor cloud explosion could potentially effect nearby commercial and industrial areas.  There are no residential areas within distances of the calculated endpoint.  The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the p"

The response training and drills program includes notification of local emergency response agencies. Also, environmental agencies receive applicable SARA Tier II chemical inventory reports annually.
