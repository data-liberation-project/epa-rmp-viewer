Bluff Iowa, North Sioux City and Dakota Dunes South Dakota and South Sioux City Nebraska.  The objective of the wastewater plant is to decrease the impact, of the constituents in the waste, on the environment and on human life.  Chlorine is added to the secondary clarifier effluent between April 1 and October 31 each year.  The treated water is eventually discharged to the Missouri River.  \n\nStorage:\nChlorine is delivered to the treatment plant in one-ton cylinders.  By administrative order, a maximum of 4 one-ton containers of chlorine is stored on site in the chlorine storage room or on storage rails outside.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\nThe Sioux City Wastewater Treatment Plant Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\nChlorine detectors, Employee Training, PM Program, Chemical Right to Know, Auditing and inspections and respirator/escape pack training.  \n\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\nThe facility is designed for 30 million gallons per day and handles approximately 14.5 million.  The wastewater flows by gravity into the plant where it is treated mechanically and biologically.  A treated sludge results from the material removed during the process and after it is further treated, the sludge or Biosolids material is applied to farm land for reuse.  The treated water is chlorinated and discharged into the Missouri River.  \n\nThe Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios:  \nThe worst case release scenario as postulated in the regulation (40 CFR 68.25) is the release of the greatest quantity (of Chlorine) in a single vessel.  The intire contents of this vessel are assumed to be re;eased as a gas pver a 10 minute period.  The largest single"

      "SummaryText": " vessel at the treatment plant is a one-ton container; therefore, 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine will be released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  A release of this magnitude would be possible  if the shell of the  container failed and the liquid chlorine formed a pool and vaporized over a 10 minute period.  The likelihood of this type of catastrophic release is very minimal.  According to the EPA' s model RMP*Comp, using the rural site option, the distance to the endpoint is 3.0 miles.  There are 10,365 residents along with hospitals and schools within the 3-mile readius.  \nThe meteorological conditions associated with the worst-case release scenario, as prescribed in the regulations, is a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.36 miles per hour)and very stable atmospheric conditions.  The stable atmospheric conditions will limit the mixing of chlorine gas with the ambient air as the gas travels downwind from the point of release.  The cloud formed by the chlorine release will grow in size and decrease in concentration as it travels downwind.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:  \nThe facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorine system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with applicable codes and state law.  The treatment plant maintains emergency equipment and procedures in the PSM and the hazardous response plan.  The cylinders receive care in handling and are inspected when they arrive.  The cylinders are inspected and filled according to all state and federal regulations by the supplier.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe Sioux City Wastewater facility has not had a release involving chlorine that has required hospitilization, care of a physician or that has caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering.  \n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe treatment plant has site-specific Emerg"
