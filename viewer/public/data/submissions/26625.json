The Facility Policy\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any other chemical that is stored at the facility.  The Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries AG-21 member, which at this point in time is one of three in the State of Kansas.  AG-21 is a program that is Environmental Driven.  The Coop goes above and beyond industry standards for the safety of customers, employees, and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\nThe NH3 facility is located directly east of the city limits.  The facility has two storage tanks of 30,000 and 18,000 gallons which give a total capicity of 48,000 gallons.\n\n3.  The Worst Care and Alternate Release Scenario\nWorst case scenario would release 224,313 pounds in a 10 minute period or 22,431 per minute with a 5 mile to end point.  Alternate release could involve over filling, this could travel 0.1 mile.  The figures in the alternate release are expresssed as estimates.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Coop recognizes all safety procedures required by State and Federal Regulations.  The Coop also complies with recommendations from Farmland AG-21 policies and general industry standards.  The most common accidental release would be the overfilling of nurse trailers.  An example would be if the trailer would be filled to 85-90% on a cool morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valve to let product escape.  Our policy is not to fill above 86%.\n \n5.  Five Year Accident History\nOn September 19, 1999 at approximately 1130 pm there was a release of 3,825 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The cause of the release was due to equipment failure.  There were no personal injuries or damage to property.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\nThe Coop has an Emergency Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan, and Employee Safety Committee.  All a"
