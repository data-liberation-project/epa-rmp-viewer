Albertsons operates many retail grocery stores throughout the southwest that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in Tolleson, Arizona. Albertsons LLC Refrigerated  Distribution Center #6501 uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. Albertsons LLCs Tolleson facility has never experienced  a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nPursuant to RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119), Albertsons has developed a comprehensive written PSM program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.\n\nIn elements of both the RMP and PSM programs are addressed including:\n\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Formal studies have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards. Any recommendations from the PHA are resolved to improve facility safety.\n\nOperating Procedures: Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the ste"

The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. A pre-startup safety review is also performed when the process safety information related to the system changes significantly.\n\nMechanical Integrity: This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\nHot Work Permit: These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\n\nManagement of Change: Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\n\nIncident Investigation: NH3 Incidents, near misses and odor complaints are investigated / reviewed. Any recommendations from the investigation are resolved to improve facility safety.\n\nCompliance Audits: There are procedures to conduct regular audits to ensure that the program is in place and working properly. Any recommendations from the audit are resolved to improve the prevention program. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nAlbertsons is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Tolleson distribution center.

Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community.\n\nStationary Source And Regulated Substance:\nThe facility uses 36,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a refrigerated warehouse.\nThe process is a closed loop system that operates continuously. Compressors and condensers cycle On/Off to comply with system demand during operation. Cold storage and dock areas use evaporators to maintain room temperatures.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history reveals that there have been no releases of ammonia that meet the EPA RMP definition of an ACCIDENT during the past five years (June 2019 - June 2024).\n\nEMERGENCY REPONSE PROGRAM.\nThe facility has an emergency action plan in effect and is designed to: \n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification\nprocedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be\nimplemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nFacility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures. In the event that an\nammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate\narea who are unaware of the danger. The Albertsons plant manager will determine what\nprocedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be\nnotified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan"
