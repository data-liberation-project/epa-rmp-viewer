      "SummaryText": "Overview\n\nPeekskill Terminal is a Propane Storage and Transfer location.  This transloading process and ancillary storage system includes up to five (5) stationary pressure railcars (maximum inventory of approximately 31,000 gallons of LPG [33,600 gallons of water capacity each], maximum site storage capacity of four [4] railcars), four (4) unloading towers, two (2) 30,000 gallon LPG storage tanks, and two (2) 18,000 LPG storage tanks, two (2) truck loading stations, and three (3) rail to truck transloading stations. This system was designed and constructed in compliance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Code 58 (2004 Edition).\n\n\n\nThe terminal is used in the storage and distribution of LPG products to retail and commercial end-users.  The terminal handles, transfers, and stores bulk quantities of liquefied propane.  The facility is subject to Federal PSM regulation, which makes it also subject to Program 3 prevention under RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe primary function of the Peekskill Terminal is to act as a Propane distribution facility.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with Propane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in its handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.   Peekskill Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  To that end, the Peekskill facility complies with the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA's) Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LP Gas) Code (NFPA 58-2004) requirements for facility construction and propane handling and storage.  In addition, the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of LPG, the appropriate response if a release does occur, and an Integrated Contingency Plan/Emergency Action Plan is in place for the facility.  Response activities are coordinated w"

      "SummaryText": "ith the Peekskill City Fire Department, and copies of the plan are provided to Westchester County Public Health, the local LEPC.\n\n\n\nThe safety systems employed at the Peekskill Terminal include pressure safety valves (PSVs) on pressure vessels and pumps, shutdown valves (SDVs), excess flow valves on the railcars, loading hose breakaway protection, operator activated emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons,  and static ground line controllers.  PSVs - The pressure vessels and pumps at the Peekskill Terminal are protected against overpressure by PSV's. Releases from the Peekskill Terminal PSVs are directed to atmosphere.  Smaller thermal control valves are also located on sections of pipe carrying liquids, to protect piping from overpressure due to static fluid thermal expansion.  SDVs - Shutdown valves at the Peekskill Terminal are \"air to open, spring to close\". When adequate air pressure is removed these valves go to their fail-safe state which is closed. This facility uses compressed air to activate these valves.  The air compressor in the shop supplies the SDVs. Excess Flow Valves - Each railcar is equipped with an excess flow valve. In the event of a leak caused by pipe failure or the failure of a mechanical connection in the piping system, the excess flow valve will stop flow from the involved railcar.  These valves are activated in the presence of flow greater than 250 gallons per minute.  LPG trailers are also equipped with internal excess flow valves. ESD - There is an operator-activated plant-wide kill switch located at the loaders station in the loading office.  Activation of this shut down by depressing the black button will stop all power and cause all shutdown valves to close.\n\n\n\nAccess to the Facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nRisk Modeling and Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe \"Worst Case\" and \"Alternate\" release scenario endpoints were determined based upon the use of the EPA's free"

      "SummaryText": "ware RMP Comp.  Both release scenarios assumed a vapor cloud explosion and used the 1 psi overpressure criteria as the endpoint.  Specifics of the scenarios are as follows below.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Assumptions:\n\nThis scenario was calculated assuming the complete failure of the largest vessel on site, filled to its capacity, or 90% fill of a 30,000 gallon (wc) tank.  This scenario was selected based upon EPA published, RMP guidance documentation requiring the worst case scenario to be the highly unlikely loss of the single larges vessel resulting in a total release and vapor cloud explosion.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Assumptions:\n\nThe most likely cause of release for this facility would be the loss of a loading hose during a loading operation.  For this alternate case scenario, we assumed that a hose ruptures (through faulty manufacturing or pull-away during load), and that it takes 5 minutes to control the release.  Operating at a flow rate of approximately 300 gallons per minute, releasing for 5 minutes, and adding the volume of product in the hose at vaporization was the method to determine the amount of release.  Due to the small volume, the most likely result would be a vapor cloud, thus, a vapor cloud explosion was chosen as the most likely result scenario.  This scenario still included off-site impacts, as required in EPA guidance for selecting Alternate Release Scenarios.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Impacts and Receptors\n\nOff-site receptors were determined using LandView6, Marplot, and Google Maps and Earth applications.  The EPA freeware (LandView and Marplot) were used to identify numbers of impacted residents based upon the most recent US Census Bureau numbers, as well as other public receptors.  The satellite views in Earth and Maps were used to verify the public receptor and public use areas data.  The facility is located in the middle of a heavy industrial area, however, there are residential and environmental receptors on the outskirts of the impact radius.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n"

Because it was a retail propane facility, filling and selling DOT cylinders, it was exempt from RMP regulation.  This company has leased the facility, but does not have retail propane clients, therefore, it is now subject to RMP and PSM, and this is the initial submittal for the facility in this non-retail service.
