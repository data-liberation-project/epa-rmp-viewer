Carbon fiber is utilized in many important applications such as commercial and military aircraft structural components, satellites, recreation products (golf shafts, fishing rods and tennis rackets), and infrastructure applications (bridges) and industrial products (air tanks, computer housings, etc.).\r\n\r\n \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nHexcel Decatur is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is the foundation of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  Hexcel's program covers areas such as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  For example, our critical control valves are design to fail closed, meaning in a loss of power or other incident they would close preventing a release.  In the unlikely event of a release, we are tied directly to the Emergency Management Association (EMA) who would coordinate an orderly response to minimize the impact.  We have a contracted emergency response agreement with SWS Environmental Response to contain and mitigate any onsite emergency event.  Through SWS, the EMA, and the Decatur Fire Department adequate emergency response will be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Hexcel Decatur facility is regulated under RMP due to onsite acrylonitrile storage being in excess of the 20,000-lb. toxicity above RMP applicability threshold.   The acrylonitrile storage system provides raw materials to the process and consists of a series of tanks for storage, feed, and recovery.  The single largest vessel stores a ma"

Public receptors were determined to be located within the impact zone of both the worst-case and alternative releases.  The impact zones were determined to be 2.9 miles and 2.2 miles, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing procedural, training, management and maintenance systems already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for acrylonitrile in response to the RMP requirements.  The management structure ensures safety is documented in the facility's RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and standards (US EPA 40 CFR 68).\r\n\r\nThe following outlines the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at Hexcel Decatur.  Hexcel Decatur complies with OSHA standard 29CFR1910.119 (PSM).\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nHexcel Decatur maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  This information is updated through a comprehensive Management of Change program.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are Hazop. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary, and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  All document changes and revisions are approved by a document control system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nHexcel Decatur has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Job orientation and transfer training, as well as, competency testing is used.\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nHexcel Decatur carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Only qualified personnel with appropriate training carry out maintenance operations.  These personnel receive specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures and a MOC control database are in place at Hexcel Decatur to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudits\r\n\r\nHexcel Decatur conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  We also conduct other safety, environmental, and health audits at least annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nHexcel Decatur promptly investigates any incident or near miss incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Corrective Actions are documented and followed to completion by the use of the CAR and EHS Incident database systems. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nHexcel Decatur truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
