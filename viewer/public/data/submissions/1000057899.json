In fact, we have a comprehensive safety program that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental releases and against the injuries and damage that could occur.\r\n\r\nLimiting the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance, we always consider less hazardous alternatives.  When we must use a hazardous substance, we consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\r\n\r\nPreventing releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, maintained and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  We work continuously to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release. We work closely with the Ashtabula Township Fire Department and the Ashtabula County Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.  Our safety program consists of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  We take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These steps include (1) training programs for personnel, ("

      "SummaryText": "We at ASHTA Chemicals Inc. (ASHTA Chemicals) are committed to operating our processes in a manner that is safe for our workers, the community, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, we have established a Business Discipline System to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Our mission statement reads as follows: Great people working with great care to bring great products to our customers.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with having hazardous substances at our facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at ASHTA Chemicals.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.\r\n\r\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n1. A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see sections 3 and 5.\r\n\r\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule - see Section 4.\r\n\r\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see Section 6.\r\n\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this executive summary.\r\n\r\nAlthough our risk management program helps ensure that our facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the"

We provide emergency response training to our personnel so that they are well prepared to handle emergency situations and execute emergency response actions.\r\n\r\n2.  Regulated Substances We Produce\r\n\r\nChlorine is covered as a toxic material by the RMP rule.  We produce and store chlorine in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.  ASHTA has two activities that meet the definition of process in OAC 3745-104-01.  The manufacturing process includes two 350,000-pound chlorine storage tanks that are connected to a 90-ton railcar for a maximum quantity of 880,000 pounds.  The second process is on-site storage of full 90-ton chlorine railcars.  Based on site history, the maximum number of railcars ever expected to be on site at one time is 45, which results in a maximum quantity of 8,100,000 pounds for this process.\r\n\r\n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nWe performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine to affect the public or the environment. We evaluated one worst-case release scenario and one more reasonable (but still highly unlikely) alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nWe do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  This scenario is designed to estimate the maximum possible area that could be affected by a release at our facility, but it is not a realistic scenario. An alternative release scenario was analyzed to provide emergency responders with information that should help them to improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur at a facility like ASH"

      "SummaryText": "TA Chemicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nWe have always believed that safety is the highest priority.  Beginning in 1992, we incorporated this belief into a prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  For ASHTA Chemicals, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are nearly identical to the PSM regulation.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements. \r\n\r\n4.1  Prevention Program\r\n\r\nOur accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n\r\n4.1.1.  Process safety information.  We maintain a variety of technical documents, including an Emergency Preparedness Plan, to help ensure that our employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our facility.  These documents address (a) physical properties of the hazardous substances we handle, (b) operating parameters for our equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for our equipment.  We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\r\n\r\n4.1.2.  Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update process hazard analyses of our processes to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of our processes.  This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to area personnel, and, when appropriate, change"

Our process engineers, operators, and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\r\n-  Steps for safely conducting activities\r\n-  Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\r\n-  Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\r\n\r\n4.1.4.  Training.  We train workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the process, (b) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (c) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Both written and oral reviews are used to verify that an employee understands the training material.\r\n\r\n4.1.5.  Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our processes.\r\n\r\n4.1.6.

All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\n4.1.7.  Pre-startup safety review.  We recognize that new or newly modified processes are historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation.  This review confirms that:\r\n-  Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\r\n-  Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\r\n-  Employee training has been completed\r\n-  For a covered process, a process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new, or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\r\n\r\n4.1.8. Compliance audit.  One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment.  We contract an internal and then a third party audit of our program every 3 years to ensure that we are effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved and appropriate actions or enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\n4.1.9.  Incident investigation.  We investigate all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar incidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees in root cause investigation techniques.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours"

Employee participation.  We have a written employee participation program for our covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of our workers are addressed.  We encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n4.1.11.  Hot work permits.  We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our facility.  We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form and work area before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices orientation.\r\n\r\n4.1.12.  Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures.  The contractor is required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who will work at the facility before that worker begins work at our facility. This training is updated annually for each employee.\r\n\r\n4.2  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, special measures and safety features specific to chlorine have been implemented at ASHTA Chemicals to prevent accidents or releases.

Storage tank pressures are automatically maintained at a pressure eight times less than the pressure rating of the vessel. All chlorine lines transferring liquid or gaseous product are inspected for mechanical integrity at regular frequencies.  Preventive maintenance is performed on all process equipment to ensure continuous operation without incident. ASHTA Chemicals maintains a redundant chlorine vent scrubber system in which a backup scrubber is always available should the on-line system malfunction. Emergency generators will automatically provide electricity to critical systems to prevent the release of chlorine in the event of a power loss.  These are just some of the measures which help ASHTA Chemicals safeguard the employees, public, and the environment.\r\n\r\n5.
