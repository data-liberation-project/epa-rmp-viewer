This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The City of Fort Smith's P Street Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substance but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0\tDescription of the City of Fort Smith's P Street\n\tWastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\nThe City of Fort Smith's P Street Wastewater Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of Fort Smith, Arkansas.  The facility is part of the City of Fort Smith's wastewater collection and treatment system, which has 13 contract customers and services an area with a population of over 150,000 people.  The City of Fort Smith's P Street Wastewater Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for the disinfection of the wastewater prior to releasing to the receiving stream.\n \n \n 3.0\tHazard Assessment\n \n \n The RMP Rule requires The City of Fort Smith's P Street Wastewater Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the chlorine stored and used in the chlorination process at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the to"

The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site endpoints and public receptors.\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a cylinder valve sticking in the open position allowing a sixty minute release of chlorine gas.  The toxic cloud formed by the escaping gas would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n\n4.0\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and\n\tChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for the City of Fort Smith's P Street Wastewater Treatment Plant chlorination process.  The following details the prevention program elements at the City of Fort Smith's P Street Wastewater Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1\tSafety Information\n\nThe City of Fort Smith's P Street Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the City of Fort Smith's P Street Wastewater Treatment Plant processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the City of Fort Smith's P Street Wastewater Treatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered processes.
