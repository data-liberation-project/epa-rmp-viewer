The plant is designed to separate liquids from the natural gas stream by physical separation in the slug catcher.  The Y-Grade liquids are then stabilized for transport by pipeline or tank truck.\r\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Cuero Compressor Station because the plant handles and stores methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutene, pentane and isopentane in excess of threshold quantities.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the facility:\r\n1. A Section 112(r)Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  ETC Texas PL, Ltd is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Cuero Compressor Station, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  ETC Texas PL, Ltd, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Dewitt County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n2. Risk Management Plan - The Cuero Compressor Station recovers natural gas liquids by physical separation in the slug catcher and stabilizes natural gas liquids for transport by pipeline or truck.  This process involves the handling and storage of chemicals in excess of thresholds specified in A Section 112(r), ETC Texas PL, Ltd management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids.

These programs are documented and described in the facility's Risk Management Plan.\r\nFor planning purposes, ETC Texas PL, Ltd has considered the impact of a worst case accident, defined to be the destruction of V-1600 resulting in the instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which explodes.  Using the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations, a potential radius of impact due to the explosion was calculated to extend to 0.61 mile.  Demographic information based on the 2009-2013 U.S. Census, indicates that seven (7) homes with 19 residences (residences based on 7 homes with a \"persons per household\" value of 2.66) are within the radius.  Five (5) industrial receptors are within the 0.61 mile radius.  However, it should be emphasized that the probability of the worst case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote - far less than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury.  A consideration of the 0.61 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\r\nETC Texas PL, Ltd also considered the impact of a more likely release.  This alternative release is characterized as an accident during loading of liquids between a truck and LACT skid.  If the transfer hose ruptured during unloading operations, this would cause a release of a mixture of natural gas liquids under pressure.  The duration of this release could be up to ten minutes, based on the time needed to close valves.  Using EPA OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations, the impact distance of a potential explosion of the vapor cloud formed after this release was calculated to 0.27 mile.  One (1) home with 3 residences (residences based on 1 home with a \"persons per household\" value of 2.66) and three (3) industrial receptors are located within this radius.\r\nETC Texas PL, Ltd has implemented safety precautions and proc"
