The PSM Program is incorporated into this document by reference. \r\n\r\nBecause of Saft America, Inc,'s committment to safety, rigorous safety planning and procedures for the safe handling of sulfur dioxide have been instituted. Process Safety Management (PSM) has already examined several of the safety practices and procedures in place for employees. All employees have been trained in hazard communication, hazardous materials handling training (where applicable), hazardous waste handling (where applicable), lock out/tag out, equipment emergency shutdown procedures, etc. Further, all employees have been instructed as to means of egress and congregation points. Evacuation routes are posted throughout the facility.\r\n\r\nThe worse case scenario for the release of sulfur dioxide is breach of the bulk storage tank resulting in the release of the entire tank contents. The off site consequence analysis was performed by utilizing the US EPA published Off Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document and RMP*CompTM software. Under the worse case release scenario, the sulfur dioxide released would reach off site endpoints and nearby public receptors. In addition to the worse case scenario, two alternative scenarios have also been analyzed. \r\n\r\nBecause of the potential impact to off site and public receptors, the facility has developed and implemented safety programs and procedures for the safe handling of sulfur dioxide. The rules and regulations with which we comply include 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management; 29 CFR 1910.38, Emergency Response and Fire Prevention; 40 CFR 265, Hazardous Waste Management; 49 CFR 171, Hazardous Materials Handling; 29 CFR 1910.134, Personal Protective Equipment; and other rules pertaining to water and air emissions.\r\n\r\nThis facility has not had a reportable release of sulfur dioxide during the past five years.

All of the vented gaseous sulfur dioxide, either from filling operations, electrolyte mixing, or from pressure relief valve venting, is collected and routed through a wet scrubber prior to discharge. Both the tank and appurtenant piping are routinely examined. \r\n\r\nSulfur dioxide is delivered to the facility in tanker trucks, and is unloaded directly into the sulfur dioxide storage tank. There is a specific unloading procedure posted at the facility. The unloading process involves connecting liquid transfer (loading) and vapor transfer (return) piping in the proper sequence. The reason for the return piping is to close the loop, impound all sulfur dioxide vapors and not allow escape of any material. It is a requirement that all sulfur dioxide delivery truck drivers be trained in hazardous materials handling and specifically in sulfur dioxide handling. In addition, all off loading is conducted by trained Saft America, Inc. personnel.\r\n \r\nSulfur dioxide is transferred from the bulk storage tank through a designed and engineered piping system. There are piping leak detection devices along the piping path. In addition, there are sulfur dioxide area monitors located in the electrolyte mix room and in the battery electrolyte fill room. Both of these systems are connected to an alarm system that will warn employees of the presence of sulfur dioxide. The alarm point for the area detectors is 2 ppm, which is the mandated OSHA eight hour time period exposure level (OSHA PEL of 2 ppm).\r\n\r\nBecause of the quantity of sulfur dioxide handled, Saft America, Inc. has prepared a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan in response to regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as part of 29 CFR 1910.119.

      "SummaryText": "Saft America, Inc. has adopted rigorous safety, accidental release and emergency response procedures into its overall policies. Senior management is committed to these policies. This commitment is evidenced through support and direction given to both safety and environmental programs. This commitment is further exemplified through lack of incidents, injuries and lost time accidents. \r\n\r\nAt this facility, Saft America, Inc. manufactures specialty batteries for civilian and military use. Some of these specialty batteries use sulfur dioxide as a component of the electrolyte which is encapsulated into the battery. Larger battery systems are typically built by combining several battery cells which are connected through circuit boards. All of the components (cells, wiring and circuit board) are then further encapsulated in a tough plastic box for use in remote locations. \r\n\r\nSaft America, Inc., is located on about twelve acres of a 25 acre parcel of land north of the Town of Valdese, North Carolina off Lovelady Road. A fence surrounds the entire facility. A Site Security Plan has been developed, approved and implemented and is incorporated by reference into this document. The facility is designed primarily for mechanical manufacturing, with a chemical mixing and storage area. The facility allows for (a) the receipt and storage of sulfur dioxide, (b) the receipt and storage of other electrolyte materials, (c) the mixing of the other electrolyte materials and the sulfur dioxide, (d) injection of the electrolyte into the cell, and (e) a wet scrubber and its supporting equipment for the pollution control of any fugitive emissions of sulfur dioxide. \r\n\r\nThe sulfur dioxide tank is located in a separate isolated room which has its own diking system.
