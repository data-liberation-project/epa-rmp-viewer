Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe, at the White House Utility District, are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and audits associated with the chlorination system at the water treatment plant.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  The utility is coordinated with the Hendersonville Fire Department, which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to respond to a release of chlorine, and the plant is currently included in the Sumner County Emergency Management Agency emergency response plan.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at our water treatment plant.  Chlorine is used for disinfection in the production of potable water.  Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure.  The vapor pressure of stored chlorine is 6.8 atmospheres (99.89 pounds per square inch).  Chlorine gas is non-flammable, but it is a strong oxidizer that can support combustion of other materials.  Chlorine is a toxic gas that is considered by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to be immediately dangerous to life and health at concentrations exceeding 10 parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our plant is 16,000 pounds (lbs) or eight one-ton containers.  The one-ton container is the largest chlorine storage vessel on-site and all of the containers are located in the Chlorine Room, which is of fire-resistant construction in accordance with the Chlorine Institute specification for chlorine storage facilities.  The chlorination system is equipped with safety features such as chlorine gas detection and alarm notification.\n\n3.  The Genera"

The following sections briefly review and update the elements of the Program 3 prevention program.  In the past five years, our water treatment plant has taken all the necessary steps to address the requirements of each element of the program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nOur operating staff at the water treatment plant ensures the process safety information that describes the chemical properties and chemical hazards, operating parameters, and process equipment associated with the chlorination system is accurate and complete.  Process safety information was last reviewed on April 17, 2004.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur utility district uses a team familiar with the plant\u00bfs chlorination system and the PHA technique to review the hazards of the process and to review the adequacy of the safeguards in place.  The team\u00bfs recommendations, resolutions, and corrective actions are addressed in a timely manner.  The last PHA was conducted on May 25, 2004.  No changes were recommended from the PHA.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, written operating procedures are in place, regularly reviewed, updated to reflect changes, and accessible to the operating staff.  The most recent review/revision of the operating procedures for the chlorination system was conducted on September 16, 2003.\n\nTraining\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that the operating staff is competent to operate the plant\u00bfs chlorination system.  Refresher training is provided annually and more frequently, if needed.  The training program was last reviewed/revised on May 25, 2004.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPreventative maintenance, inspection, and testing of th"

Written inspection/preventative maintenance procedures for the chlorination equipment are used at the plant.  The preventative maintenance procedures/ schedule were reviewed/revised on April 20, 2004.  The most recent equipment inspection/testing was conducted on April 28, 2004.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe White House Utility District has in place an incident investigation procedure that calls for the investigation of each incident which results in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine from its facilities.  An investigation is initiated as promptly as possible by an incident investigation team, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  Incident investigations have not been required in the last five years.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe White House Utility District maintains a team to conduct audits of all safety related programs, including the risk management program.  These audits will be carried out annually and any recommended corrective actions will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  The most recent program audit was conducted on May 25, 2004.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the water treatment plant to safely manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures of the chlorination system.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a change to the chlorination system are promptly informed of the change and given training on the change before startup.  There has not been a major change to the water treatment plant\u00bfs chlorination system in the last five years that would have triggered the management of change procedure.  A review/revision of the management of change procedure will be conducted by July 1, 2004.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews are required for major changes to the chlorination system."

The most recent review/revision of the pre-startup procedures for the chlorination system was on May 1, 2004.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the White House Utility District hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities within or near the area of the chlorination system.  The White House Utility District has a procedure in place to inform contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor\u00bfs work and the covered process.  A review/revision to the contractor safety procedures will be conducted by July 1, 2004.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe White House Utility District believes that successful implementation of the risk management program is a team effort.  All plant employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to make recommendations.  A job responsibility of the operating staff is to implement the risk management program; the operating staff has access to all the information created for the program.  A review/revision of the employee participation plan will be conducted by July 1, 2004.\n\nHot Work Permits\nWhenever hot work (welding, cutting, etc.) is performed on or near the chlorination system, the hot work procedure must be followed and a hot work certificate must be issued.  This applies to work performed by the operating staff and to outside contractors.  The hot work permit procedure will be reviewed/ revised by July 1, 2004.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\nThe water treatment plant has had an excellent record in the prevention of accidental chlorine releases over the last five years.
