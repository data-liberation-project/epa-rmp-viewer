This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as hazardous materials segregation procedures. Material handling equipment maintenance, and employee training associated with storage of hazardous materials at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 3 regulated substances present at our facility. \n1.Hydrazine\n2.Hydrofluoric Acid 70% Aqueous Solution\n3.Peracetic Acid.\n\nWe have varying inventories for these chemicals for this reason we are filing this RMP report under the predictive filing concept. The maximum inventories for these chemicals are: Hydrazine 31,000 pounds packaged in 55-gallon drums and 350-gallon IBC. Hydrofluoric Acid 70% Solution 30,400 pounds packaged in 55-galon drums and Peracetic Acid 36,400 pounds packaged in 55-gallon drums.\n\nDrums are transported and stored in wooden pallets and secured with metal strips to protect a drum from falling from a pallet.\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used RMP*Comp\u00bf.  The worse case scenario will be a liquid spill and vaporization of the biggest container present in our warehouse. A 350-gallon Intermediate Bulk Container or Tote of Hydrazine is our biggest container. We are considering the building as passive mitigation for the calculation of the toxic endpoint. The alternative scenario will be the release of hydrofluoric acid 70% from a plastic dr"
