      "SummaryText": "Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant is located approximately 2 miles north of Lusby, Maryland in Calvert County, Maryland.  The facility operates two nuclear power steam electric power plants (SIC 4911).The facility is built into the cliffs immediately adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay with an upper topography of the site that is generally flat.  The site encompasses approximately 2100 mostly forested acres.   The site is bounded on the east by the Chespapeake Bay and the rest is surrounded by predominately forested area with some residential development at the site boundary.\n\nUnit 1 of  Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Plant began generating electricity in 1975 and Unit 2 joined the system in 1977. Since then, Calvert Cliffs has continually set records for power production and worker safety.  Both of the Units are Pressurized Water Reactors.  In this design, there are three main water cycles that do not mix.  The primary loop carries pressurized heated water from the reactor to a steam generator.  The secondary system uses the water heated in the primary loop to create steam in the secondary side of the steam generator.  The steam in the secondary loop is used to turn an electric generator that produces electricity.  The circulating water system uses water from the Chesapeake Bay to condense the steam exhausted from the electric generator so that the water can be reused in the secondary system.\n\nTo preserve the secondary system for long term safe operation, precise chemistry controls are maintained and monitored.  Chemicals are added to the secondary system to prevent corrosion.  One of these chemicals is ammonium hydroxide.  The ammonium hydroxide is used to create an alkaline environment in the secondary system to reduce corrosion.  \n\nThe ammonium hydroxide is stored in a 8,500 gallon, seismic class 2 above ground, double walled, polyethylene secured by steel cables to a seismic class 2 concrete pad.  The outer tank has a 10,000 gallon capacity.  The tanks discharge is connect"

The tank is filled from a tanker truck.  The procedure for for filling the ammoina tank is Chemistry Procedure, CP-414, \"Filling the Bulk Chemical Storage Tanks\".  During the offload two persons are performing the offload fully dressed in protective equipment to provide assistance and/or summon help should a leak or spill occur.\n\nThe site maintains a large supply of spill control equipment in designated locations and maintains personnel on-site at all times to respond to fires, medical emergencies and spills.  The site maintains a strong spill response plan in accordance with the SPCC.  The emergency response plan can call back additional site personnel to respond to a spill.  Additionally the plan has vendor resources that can be brought in to assist.  A contract is maintained in place for the vendor response to prevent delays in response.\n\nThe tank is regularly inspected and monitored.  Maintenance of the tank is documented and completed in a timely fashion.  Training at the plant is conducted throughout the year.  Emergency response training is conducted annually at a minimum.  These training sessions have included drills in which Maryland Department of the Environment has participated.  \n\nThe following paragraph is the safety policy at CCNPP.  \"The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant work environment shall incorporate measures to promote safety of employees, contractors and visitors.  Design, construction, operation, maintenance and testing of facilities shall incorporate safety principles to protect the public workers and property.\"  At the core of the policy implementation is that accidents can be prevented.  To that end, CCNPP conducts periodic safety breaks to reinforce safety in the work place.\n\nCalvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant is in the process of submitting of an application to become an OSHA Voluntary Protection Pro"

      "SummaryText": "gram.  The Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) promote effective worksite-based safety and health. In the VPP, management, labor, and OSHA establish cooperative relationships at workplaces that have implemented a comprehensive safety and health management system. Approval into VPP is OSHA?s official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.\n\nThere have been no accidents involving the ammonium hydroxide tank in the last five years.\n\nCurrently a modifcation is being pursued to reduce the concentration of ammonium hydroxide stored onsite that will improve the safety of site personnel and the public in the event of a release."
