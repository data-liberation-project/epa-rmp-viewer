This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\u0095\tIntroduction;\n\u0095\tCostco\u0092s policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u0095\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u0095\tHazard Assessment;\n\u0095\tPrevention Program;\n\u0095\tFive-Year Accident History;\n\u0095\tEmergency Response Plan; \n\u0095\tEmergency Communications;\n\u0095\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n\u0095\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\n\u0095\tManagement Program\n\nII.\tCostco\u0092s Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Costco; this RMP re-submittal formalizes and documents these activities. Costco is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Costco policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility\u0092s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contract"

The facility processes ground beef and hot dogs. The NAICS code for the processes at the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one RMP regulated refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating meat products. The amount of ammonia currently present in this refrigeration system is approximately 70,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\nIV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\nThe toxic endpoint distance is 1.2 miles for the worst case scenario. Based upon year 2010 census data, the population within a radius of 1.2 miles is 3,203.\n\nV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Alternative Release Scenario (ARS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternate scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\nThe toxic endpoint distance is 0.2 miles for the alternative release scenario. Based upon year 2010 census data, the population within a radius of 0.2 miles is 2. In addition, a small population group may be affected by the ARS due to the close proximity of commercial business to the facility. \n\nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases i"

The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\u0095\tEmployee Participation \u0096 Costco has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program ensures employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  Employees at Costco have assisted in developing the initial PHA and have assisted in revalidating the PHA every five years.
