      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCountry Oven Bakery recognizes management?s responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, the environment, equipment and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Bowling Green facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company?s goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA?s Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Eric J. Smarko, Plant Engineer, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved a necessar"

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nIn addition to the Plant Safety Program, the Country Bakery facility follows the following corporate and site-specific safety guidelines:\n-Employee Handbook Plant Safety Rules\n-Kroger Company Contractor Safety Rules\n-Kroger Company Manufacturing Safety Key Element Assessment (KEA) &\nManagement\n-Kroger Company Behavioral Accident Prevention Process (BAPP) Steering Committee\n-General Office (GO) Safety Inspection Program and Abatement Plans\n-Job Safety analysis (JSA) departmental Program\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCountry Oven Bakery is part of the Kroger Company.  The facility manufactures frozen dough products and bakery items.  It operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 20,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA?s RM program.\n\nDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Process Safety Management Program consists of the following elements:  \n\nEmployee Participation - The purpose of the Employee Participation Program Element, upon implementation, is to provide for a cooperative participatory environment and necessary flow of information from management to employees and from employees to management.  This flow of information on process safety is expected to help eliminate or mitigate the consequences of catastrophic releases of highly hazardous chemicals in the workplace.  Specifically, the Employee Participation Program Element is intended to involve appropriate employees at an elemental level of the PSM Program, particularly in the"
