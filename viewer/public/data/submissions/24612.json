(Daikin) is a fluorocarbon manufacturing facility located in Decatur, Alabama.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: chloroform, hydrogen fluoride (HF), ethylene, and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE).  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 3 requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\n\nDaikin has a joint venture with 3M, called MDA Manufacturing, Inc. (MDA).  Daikin operates the MDA manufacturing process and oversees safety, environmental and maintenance for MDA.  In an emergency involving either Daikin or MDA, Daikin personnel will be directly involved.  According to Chapter 1 of the EPA General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), for joint ventures, \"? the legal entity you have established to operate these processes should file the RMP.  If you consider the entity a subsidiary, you should be listed as the parent company in the RMP\".  Therefore, Daikin is submitting the RMP for the covered process, which includes the MDA operations.\n\nHF and chloroform are delivered to the facility via railcars and are offloaded to storage tanks.  In the process, HF and chloroform are used as raw materials in the production of chlorodifluoromethane (R-22) at MDA.   \n\nTFE is produced from R-22 at Daikin.  TFE is stored in storage tanks and is used as a raw material for other Daikin products.  It is transported via pipeline to MDA to manufacture hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and is also transported via pipeline to a nearby 3M facility.\n\nEthylene is delivered and stored on site in tube trailers.  Ethylene is a raw material used in the production of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene at Daikin.  \n                                                                  \nVinyl chlorid"

Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Daikin\n\nDaikin is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Plant Safety Manual.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n \nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform the following offsite consequence analyses.\n? One worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated toxic substances held in excess of the threshold quantity.  A worst-case release scenario analysis was conducted for HF.\n? One worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated flammable substances held in excess of the threshold quantity.  A worst-case release scenario analysis was conducted for TFE.\n? One alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in excess of the threshold quantity.  An alternative release scenario analysis was calculated for both HF and chloroform.\n? One alternative release scenario to represent all regulated flammable substance held in excess of the threshold quantity.  An alternative release scenario analysis was evaluated for TFE. \n\nThe following are brief descriptions of the release scenarios that are being submitted by Daikin in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).   Daikin elected to use the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document and the \"look-up\" tables contained in this document to calculate estimated release rates and to determine the distances to the appropriate toxic and flammable endpoints.  Daikin evaluated numerous scena"

More detailed information is provided in Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5. \n\nToxic Chemicals\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario for Daikin was determined to be an instantaneous liquid spill and vaporization of the entire contents of a HF railcar.  A major release of this magnitude is extremely unlikely due to the advances that have taken place in railcar design as well as the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs present at both the Daikin facility and that of our suppliers.  Daikin used the EPA \"look-up\" tables to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint from the release location.  Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 of the RMPlan provide information regarding the residential population, public and environmental receptors located within the distance to the endpoint for this scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nThe alternative release scenario for HF was determined to be a pressure gauge failure on the discharge of the HF pumps.  Vapor sensors in the area will provide indication to the control room that a HF leak has occurred.  Upon verification of the leak the control room operator will stop the HF pump, close the HF receiver outlet valve and isolate the piping and pump from the reactor and receiver.  The failure could result in a release of liquid HF.   Daikin used the EPA \"look-up\" tables,  to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for HF from the release location. Sections 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14 of the RMPlan provide information regarding the residential population, public and environmental receptors located within the distance to the endpoint for this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chloroform was determined to be a release from a piping failure.  Daikin used the EPA \"look-up\" tables, to calculate distance to the toxic endpoint for chloroform from the release location.  The dis"

Daikin used the EPA \"look-up\" tables, to determine the distance to a 1 psia overpressure from the release location.  The distance off-site for this release scenario is very short, resulting in no impacts to residential areas or environmental receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative flammable release scenario for the facility was determined to be a PSV relief on a vinyl chloride storage tank.  Daikin used the EPA \"look-up\" tables to determine the distance to the lower flammable limit for vinyl chloridefrom the release location. The distance off-site for this release scenario is very short, resulting in no impacts to residential areas or environmental receptors.\n\nD. Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  \n\nOn 11 May 1999 an explosion and fire occurred at the Daikin facility involving TFE, killing three (3) Daikin employees and injuring one (1) Daikin employee.  No offsite impacts occurred as a result of this accident.  This accident has been reported under Section 6 of the Accident History portion of the RMP Plan.  \n\nDaikin has not had any other accidents within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nE.
