It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with ORLANDO FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Orlando facility's primary activities include the repackaging and distribution of chemical products.  We have three (3) regulated substances present at the Orlando facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous and Aqua Ammonia.  Chlorine is received into Orlando in 180,000 pound railcars.  Chlorine is repackaged in different  containers and used to produce bleach (sodium hypochlorite)for distribution to our customers.
