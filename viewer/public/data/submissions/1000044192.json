This is accomplished to a great extent by a well developed, up-to-date and implemented Risk Management Program. All USCS facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner. It shall be the responsibility of the plant manager to ensure that all procedures are followed as set forth in our Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs. In the unlikely event of an accidental release it is USCS policy to immediately call the National Response Center, Local Emergency Response Committee, the local Fire Department and other agency(ies) that may be required. All USCS facilities will have an emergency response team to assist these agency(ies).\r\n\r\nUnited States Cold Storage, Tracy is a public refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia, most commonly known as ammonia, is an excellent refrigerant and is commonly used in most of the world's industrial refrigeration systems. Ammonia has an excellent warning property, its odor. Ammonia's odor is familiar to most people due to the fact that it is commonly used in household cleaning solutions. Ammonia can be detected as low as 5 parts per million (PPM) and has an average life span of 7 days in the environment before it breaks down to its common elements nitrogen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nTypical items stored within USCS facilities are raw or processed food items that can be found in your supermarket or local restaurant. Temperatures range between -30 degrees to +45 degrees F. The refrigeration equipment and piping are located inside and outside the facility. The condensers and related piping are on the machine room roof with the piping to and from the freezers, coolers, truck and rail docks located on the warehouse and dock roofs. The machine room contains most of the large refrigeration machinery and vesse"

      "SummaryText": "ls.  In an unlikely event of a refrigerant leak in a refrigerated space, the ammonia vapor would be contained inside the space, due to the vapor tight construction of the facility. It then may be treated and/or vented under controlled conditions.  The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors throughout to help lessen any leaks that might occur and to provide an early alert.\r\n\r\nUSCS believes that prevention is foremost.  All of USCS facilities are maintained by a staff of trained maintenance personnel. Most of these people are members of the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) and all Chief Engineers are members of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). USCS has on staff at the corporate level a Regulatory Compliance and Safety Manager who is a certified Safety Professional by Board of Certified Safety Professionals.  All the vessels and piping have been installed according to ASME vessel and piping codes and applicable local Building, Fire and Mechanical Codes. The Tracy facility was engineered and built to a Seismic 4 Earthquake Code. \r\n\r\nThe USCS Tracy facility has been operating at this location for the past 22 years. Within that long history the facility has seen no refrigerant releases. Since March 1993, this facility has not experienced any accidents releases from out refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for 29 CFR 1910.38-Emergency Action Plan, OSHA's 1910.119, Process Safety Management and 1910.120 HAZWOPER standards. We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nThe review of the PHA recently performed for this facility produced seven recommendations to improve safety. The first PHA produced 29 recommendations to improve safety at the Tracy facility. Such recommendation included training, installation of new mitigation and/or controls, equipment and/or technology along with organizational chang"

Housekeeping of the engine room area includes wiping up and investigating oil leaks and moping, the engine room floors on a daily to weekly bases.
