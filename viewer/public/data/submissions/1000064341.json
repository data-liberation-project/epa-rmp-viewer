The Ormesa Geothermal Projects are near the Cities of El Centro and Holtville, California within the East Mesa Known Geothermal Resource Area (KGRA). The facilities are located east of the Highline Canal. They generate electricity from renewable geothermal resources in an environmentally friendly manner.\n\n\n\nOrmat operates the Ormesa Geothermal Projects in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations and is committed to maintaining compliance with these regulations.  The Ormesa Geothermal Projects have emergency response procedures and protocols in place at the facility in coordination with local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nThe project area, defined as the stationary source under RMP, covers a large geographic area and consists of three independent geothermal power plants, and associated geothermal wells. Each power plant is separate process as defined under the CalARP regulation as well as the Federal EPA Risk Management Program Regulation (RMP, codified at 40CFR68), and the Federal OSHA Process Safety Management Regulation (PSM, codified at 29CFR1910.119).\n\n\n\nOrmesa 1: Is a binary geothermal power plant consisting of four Ormat Energy Converters (OECs). The OECs extract heat from pumped hot geothermal brine to vaporize isopentane, which in turn drives associated turbines and electrical generators. The isopentane exiting the turbine is condensed, pumped, and re-vaporized in a closed-loop cycle. Approximately 12-14 megawatts of power is generated from this plant.\n\n\n\nOrmesa 2: Is a binary geothermal power plant consisting of two Ormat Energy Converters (OECs). The OECs extract heat from pumped hot geothermal brine to vaporize isopentane, which in turn drives associated turbines and electrical generators. The isopentane exiting the turbine is condensed, pumped, and re-vaporized in a closed-loop cycle. App"

      "SummaryText": "roximately 15 megawatts of power is generated from this plant.\n\n\n\nGBU: The GEM Bottoming Unit (GBU) is a binary geothermal power plant consisting of one Ormat Energy Converters (OECs) and one brine reinjection pump unit. There are adjacent dual flash plants, GEM 2&3, at this location that flash geothermal brine to produce steam to drive turbines and electrical generators. The GBU plant extracts heat from the hot residual liquid that remains after the brine is flashed at GEM 2&3. The heat from the dual flash plant liquid is used to vaporize isopentane, which in turn drives associated turbines. The isopentane exiting the turbine is condensed, pumped and re-vaporized in a closed loop cycle. One turbine drives an electrical generator, producing approximately 3 megawatts of power. The other turbine drives a brine reinjection pump rated at 3,500 Hp. It should be noted that the GEM2 dual flash plant has been decommissioned at this time and all hot brine for the GBU is produced from GEM 3.\n\n\n\nAll three Ormesa processes are subject to RMP, PSM, and CalARP due to the presence of isopentane in excess of 10,000 pounds in each process. Isopentane is a listed flammable substance in RMP and CalARP. Isopentane meets the definition of a flammable liquid under the PSM regulation.\n\n\n\nOffsite consequence analyses have been conducted for each of the three Ormesa processes. A worst case release can potentially impact offsite public receptors on an adjacent recreational area. The most stringent prevention program requirements are applied at all Ormesa processes. \n\n\n\nOrmat has revalidated the prevention programs required by RMP, PSM, and CalARP.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n - MSDS (in the new safety data sheet format) is available for isopentane and the hazards are well understood.\n\n - Block flow and heat and mass balances are available for all processes.\n\n - Maximum intended inventory is defined.\n\n - Safe upper and lower limits with consequences of deviation are defined for each proce"
