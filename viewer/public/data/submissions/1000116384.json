Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies  \nArcher Daniels Midland Company's facilities, located in Cedar Rapids, IA strive to prevent and mitigate accidental releases of applicable substances under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  Specifically, those substances are anhydrous ammonia, anhydrous sulfur dioxide, and pentanes contained as a mixture within our fuel-grade ethanol denaturant.\nOur commitment is reflected in our Risk Management Program (RMP), as codified in 40 CFR Part \u00a768, incorporates the following, where applicable:\n1.\tImplementation of a management system, per 40 CFR \u00a748.15;\n2.\tConducting hazard assessments, per 40 CFR \u00a768.20 - \u00a768.42;\n3.\tImplementing the prevention requirements, per 40 CFR \u00a768.65 - \u00a768.87; \n4.\tImplementation of an Emergency Response Program, per 40 CFR \u00a768.90 - \u00a768.95; and\n5.\tSubmittal of Program Elements, per 40 CFR \u00a768.175. \n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe two stationary sources operated by ADM storing applicable Risk Management Program chemicals above their respective thresholds are a corn wet milling facilities and one support facility, cogeneration.  The combined products produced by the corn milling process are corn sweeteners, both liquid and dry packaged; fuel grade ethanol; dried corn starch, and dried co-products from corn milling.  The cogeneration facility provides steam and electricity to both facilities.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is solely utilized at the cogeneration facility for minimizing NOx emissions from the boilers and gas turbine, through respective Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) chemistry.  Atmospheric emissions using this technology are regulated in accordance with the air quality permit established by Linn County Public Health Department, Air Quality Division.  \n\nSulfur dioxide is used solely in the wet milling process as a manufacturing aid for separating the corn kernel into its viable comp"

      "SummaryText": "onents.  Sulfur dioxide is also a disinfectant that satisfies our necessary product quality requirements for food grade product applications.  The dual application of sulfur dioxide provides the necessary operational flexibility and minimizing extraneous chemical inventories for similar applications.\n\nPentanes (n-pentane and i-pentane) are RMP listed components of natural gasoline, used for denaturing ethanol for fuel grade applications.  The estimated quantity of pentanes are over-stated in accordance with threshold determinations (40 CFR \u00a768.115(b)(2)).  Because both n-pentane and i-pentane are represented by the supplier as being present in quantities greater than one percent, the entire weight of the mixture is managed as the regulated material.  Natural gasoline is stored in dedicated trailers and a dedicated bulk storage tank the Wet Mill before mixing.   Emissions from these storage locations are regulated in accordance with the air quality permit established by Linn County Public Health Department, Air Quality Division.\n\nC.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAccidental releases were evaluated for both gases and flammable liquids in accordance with the applicable requirements for worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  To aid in estimating potential offsite impacts from these release scenarios, ADM utilized US EPA's recommended software (RMP*Comp, Ver. 2.01) to estimate the endpoint radius from the facility.  Having estimated the endpoint radius, ADM applied that value to MARPLOT, Ver. 5.1.1, for identifying the offsite populations and environmental receptors.\n\nA worst-case release scenario analysis for liquefied gases has been prepared per 40 CFR \u00a768.25(c) for Program 3 type evaluations.  Liquefied sulfur dioxide gas in full railcar delivered to the site is completely released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  By this extremely conservative basis, the endpoint radius to 1/10th the IDLH value is estima"

      "SummaryText": "ted at 16 miles in any direction.  In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 68.25(a)(2)(i) and (iii), only one worst-case release scenario needs to be determined for gases. \n\nA worst-case release scenario for pentanes has been prepared per 40 CFR 68(f) for Program 3 type evaluations.  For this type of evaluation, the entire contents of a full bulk storage tank are spilled instantaneously forming a liquid pool.  Because pentanes are liquid at room temperature, the 10 minute volatilization rate is estimated by the aforementioned software, assuming the entire contents as pentanes (n-pentane and i-pentane).  Using this extremely conservative basis, the endpoint radius of 1 psi overpressure is 0.5 mile in any direction.  Worst-case release scenarios have been prepared for both n-pentane and i-pentane, resulting in identical endpoint radius to 1 psi overpressures. \n\nAlternative release scenarios have been prepared for each of the four materials, in accordance with 40 CFR 68.28(a). To develop the respective endpoint radius, in any direction, active and passive mitigation systems may be incorporated into the estimated value.  Alternative release scenarios are:\n\nSulfur dioxide\t        Vessel pinhole leak\t0.5 mile radius\nAnhydrous ammonia\tTanker truck release\t0.2 mile radius\nPentanes\t        Vessel pinhole leak\t<0.1 mile radius \n\nHaving estimated the potential offsite impact, the facility does incorporate safeguards for the minimization of accidental releases. Supported by the various Program 3 requirements (Process Safety Information, Process Hazardous Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, etc.) the facility continually identifies opportunities for improvement and implementation.  Examples include standardization of design through engineering specifications, to review and training on the operating procedures.  Increasing our focus and review of recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices whether through PHA"

Opportunities present themselves during mechanical integrity inspections, evaluations, and preventative programs that can be further evaluated with the management of change program.  Externally, ADM Cedar Rapids, IA facilities can take advantage of the acquired knowledge and experience from our family of facilities within the business unit. \n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\nSince the last 5-year US EPA RMP update, the ADM Cedar Rapids, IA facilities have not experienced an accidental release from our covered processes consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR \u00a768.42 regarding sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, and pentanes. \n\nE.  Emergency Response Program\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with ADM personnel, contractors, the Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the City of Cedar Rapids Fire Department so that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures will be implemented.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan to deal with the prevention of and response to accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The facility is also a member of the Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nF.   Planned Changes to Improved Safety\nAs indicated in the previous sections, ADM continues to evaluate and implement changes when necessary to improve safety at the Cedar Rapids facility.  Incident investigation and process hazard analysis recommendations are reviewed and implemented as necessary on a continuous basis.  This is evident through the elimination of covered processes in the Wet Mill, anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine from the Wet Mill and Cogen facilities."
