      "SummaryText": " MISHAWAKA PLANT:\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nRelease prevention and emergency response policies\nPersonnel at this Bayer Corporation (Bayer) facility take a very active approach in maintaining and improving chemical safety.  Building on well-established corporate policies, this facility has developed and follows an OSHA process safety management plan that complies with 29 CFR 1910.119.  Thus, even before the development of this risk management plan, this facility was in compliance with the level 3 prevention program requirements.\n\nBayer demonstrates its management's commitment to safety through the efforts of corporate and facility safety personnel.  Through safety committee meetings, internal audits, and monitoring of new regulatory and industry developments, Bayer meets or exceeds process safety requirements.  For compliance with 40 CFR 68, Bayer established an ammonia RMP planning committee (ammonia is the regulated substance at this facility), comprised of representatives of Bayer facilities coast-to-coast.  The activities of the committee ensure that, in addition to merely achieving compliance, Bayer is consistent in its approach to safety at all of its plants.\n\nFacility and regulated substance   \nBayer's Mishawaka Plant is part of Bayer's Diagnostics Division.  It manufactures self-testing products for blood glucose and point-of-care products such as urine chemistry analyzers and reagent strips to test for indication of kidney and liver disease.\n\nProcess cooling and the cooling of work and office areas are accomplished with a refrigeration system charged with anhydrous ammonia.  It is a closed loop system capable of producing up to 1,800 tons of refrigeration.  Hot, gaseous anhydrous ammonia is compressed to approximately 180 psig and condenses with the help of water-cooled evaporative condensers.  Liquid ammonia from the condensers is collected and stored in two receivers from which it is then transferred on demand to various chillers to cool glycol which then provi"

After absorbing heat from the glycol, the ammonia gasifies and is pulled into the compression system where the cycle is repeated.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system as a whole contains up to 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario involves one of the high-pressure receivers, each of which can contain up to 6,900 pounds of ammonia.  The rule for worst-case release analysis assumes all of the contents are released in 10 minutes.  Each receiver is inside of a building and such a release would also occur inside the same building.  Thus, an enclosure was assumed as passive mitigation in the event of the worst-case release.  Furthermore, rainout of ammonia-containing droplets and attenuation of the release to the outside air was assumed.  Taking these into account and using the appropriate EPA guidance, the release rate to the atmosphere was assumed to be 40% of an unmitigated release (280 vs. 690 pounds per minute).  No other mitigative measures were considered.  However, in the event of an actual and significant release of ammonia, a water deluge system would be activated manually or, in the presence of fire, automatically.  It operates with overhead spray nozzles tied to the fire sprinkler system loop.  The deluge system is manually activated when a high ammonia concentration or high sump level is detected and an alarm is sounded.  When this occurs, the exhaust fans blow to evaporator condensers, not to the outside air.\n\nThe alternative release scenario was based on a methodical analysis of accident history, process hazard analysis, experience at other similar company facilities, and industry experience.  The result was that a blowing 3/4-inch relief valve on the compressor oil separator discharge line was chosen as the most likely alternative scenario that would have an offsite impact.  Even this is not very likely in that system overpressure conditions r"

When this occurs, the system overpressure condition is quickly corrected to prevent further releases from the relief valve.  However, such brief bursts of gas would not have an offsite effect.  Therefore, a blowing of the 3/4-inch relief valve for one minute was chosen because it was the only relief valve scenario that would have an offsite impact, however improbable that scenario might be.  Because the release would be directly to atmosphere, no enclosure factors were considered.  No other mitigative measures were considered.\n\nFor both analyses, the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used.  The results were verified using RMP*Comp, which is based on the formulae used in the guidance document.  The distance to endpoint for the worst-case release was 0.7 mile.  For the alternative release, the distance was less than 0.1 mile.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program complies with the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 process safety management standard and the corresponding sections of the EPA 40 CFR 68 rule for program level 3 processes.  To achieve and maintain this compliance, Bayer has in place many procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an extensive employee training program and detailed operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered process.  The technological safeguards include level controls, sensors, alarms, relief valves, and redundant systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of ammonia, or at least minimize the effects of a release.\n\nFive-year accident history\nThis facility has had no accidental release of ammonia, which meets the criteria of Section 68.42 of the rule, in the last five years.\n\nEmergency response program  \nThe facility has a well-developed, written emergency response and preparedness plan t"

      "SummaryText": "hat is coordinated with local emergency responders.  The Mishawaka City Fire Department or the South Bend Hazmat Team is the primary responder.  Their response is triggered by phone communication.  Bayer employees handle incidental releases of ammonia and are trained and equipped to do so.\n\nThe emergency response and preparedness plan includes procedures for reporting emergencies, notifying the public, evacuation, system shutdown, and post-response, or cleanup, activities.  The plan clearly defines the actions that employees should take when an emergency occurs.  The lines of internal notification and authority are clearly stated.  \n\nThe facility has sensors which signal alarms located in the building, at the control panel, and at Main Plant Security.  Main Plant Security is staffed continuously.  Fire alarms and firefighting sprinkler systems are provided throughout the facility.  These are connected to Main Plant Security.  In addition, there is a deluge system that can be used to mitigate a release of ammonia.\n \nPlanned changes to improve safety\nThe maintenance and improvement of safety is an ongoing job at this facility.  Training in matters of safety takes place throughout the year.  Safety-related recommendations from employees, whether made during formal sessions like process hazard analyses or made upon observation of a potential hazard, are always considered carefully for implementation.  This process is continuous and, even at times when no major process changes are anticipated, existing safety systems and procedures are fine-tuned as a matter of course."
