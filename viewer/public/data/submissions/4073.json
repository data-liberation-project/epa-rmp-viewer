Chlorine rail cars are fabricated, tested and inspected regularly by the chlorine car owner per Department of Transportation regulations.  If this scenario actually occurred, the plant\u0012s fire protection system would be utilized via fire monitors which circle the plant to reduce the vapors generated from the spill; therefore, the theoretical distance a toxic cloud would travel is reduced.  The plant also has emergency equipment on site and personnel trained in its use to mitigate leaks from a chlorine rail car (for example,  Chlorine Institute\u0012s C-Kit).\n\nThe worst case scenario for a flammable is a 1,3 butadiene release from a 35,000 gallon storage tank.  Given the constraints of the RMP rule, the estimated distance to the endpoint is 0.5 miles.  At this distance the effect would likely be limited to minor structural damage such as broken glass (1 psig overpressurization).  It is noted that a vapor explosion can only occur if the butadiene vapors come in contact with an ignition source.  By design, the area in the vicinity of the storage tank is void of such ignition sources by utilizing explosion-proof fixtures and equipment.  The same likelihood as the chlorine rail car applies to this scenario.  The storage tank is designed, constructed and tested per American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) specifications.  The tank is protected against accidental vehicle damage by its location within a concrete dike and is not located in an area likely to be subject to damage from maintenance activities or overhead work.  The other possible cause of this scenario is due to tank failure due to over-pressurization.  The tank is protected by dual relief valves and rupture disk combinations that are annually tested and are designed to relieve tank pressure prior to causing any damage to the tanks"

      "SummaryText": "Plant Description\n\n Tomen Agro\u0012s facility in Perry, Ohio has produced a fungicide, Captan, at its current location for 45 years.  The facility is located on 77 acres in eastern Lake County in a generally rural area. \n  \nThe facility handles several chemicals in the manufacture of Captan, five of which are addressed by the RMP rule: 4-four toxics (chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, carbon disulfide and perchloromethyl mercaptan) and 1-one flammable (1,3-butadiene).\n\n\nRMP Summary\n\nThe RMP rule requires the reporting of a worst case scenario for one toxic and one flammable chemical.  In addition, an alternative scenario for each toxic and one flammable chemical  must be evaluated.  Below are the plant\u0012s scenarios.  The worst case scenarios are defined in the RMP rule as the hypothetical release of the largest quantity of the material in 10 minutes from its container.  Only passive mitigation efforts such as those controls in place that do not require action by an employee to initiate are allowed to be considered (such as a dike or enclosure in a building).  The alternative release scenarios were determined using assumptions based on past experiences by experienced plant personnel.  These alternative release scenarios are more credible to real-world potential incidents.  For alternative release scenarios, facilities are allowed to include active mitigation which includes procedures and equipment that contain or minimize the impact of an accidental release.\n\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario for toxics is a chlorine release from a 90 ton rail car that by regulation is assumed to be emptied in 10 minutes.  Under worst-case weather conditions, chlorine could travel 14 miles before reaching the toxic endpoint from the RMP regulation.  It is noted that this scenario assumes meteorological conditions that are uncommon to the area, specifically a wind speed of 1.5 mph that is far less than historical averages.  Average wind speed in this area as determined by the Natio"

This reduces the likelihood of a vapor cloud explosion.  There are also 4 fire monitors that can be directed on the tank to flood the tank with significant amounts of water.\nSimilar to the chlorine scenario, meteorological assumptions are not indicative of the region\u0012s historical averages that would increase the dispersion and dilution of the vapors generated and significantly reduce the likelihood, severity and radius of damage from this hypothetical event\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a leak of a barco joint on the unloading line used to transfer chlorine from the rail cars to the process reactors.  This scenario assumes that the 1 inch joint leaks for 5 minutes under worst case weather conditions.  The estimated distance to the endpoint for this scenario is 0.4 miles.  The mitigating circumstances that would reduce the likelihood of this event include the presence of surveillance cameras continuously monitored by plant personnel, chlorine detectors on the unloading dock to detect leaks, emergency shutoff valves on the chlorine cars that can be actuated remotely and excess flow valves built into the rail cars that are designed and constructed to Chlorine Institute standards.  In addition, the barco joints are inspected annually to insure their integrity.   \n\nThe alternative release scenario for1,3 butadiene is a quarter inch hole in the liquid unloading hose used to off-load butadiene from the rail cars to the storage tanks.  This scenario assumes an off-loading rate of 300 pounds per minute under the same worst case weather conditions as the chlorine alternative release scenario.

In addition, there is an emergency shutoff valve on the rail car that can be actuated remotely in the event of a leak and the unloading operation is continuously monitored by plant personnel.  Also, the unloading hose is tested annually to assure its mechanical integrity.\n\nThe alternative scenario for carbon disulfide is a gasket leak in the 2 inch unloading hose utilized for the off-loading of carbon disulfide from rail cars to the storage tanks.  An off-loading rate of 41 gallons per minute is assumed at 30 psig (pressure utilized to off-load the chemical).  An earthen dike under the rail car aids in the mitigation of the event and the resulting release goes off-site less than half a mile.  This event is also mitigated by several measures including a fire monitor in the vicinity,  constant monitoring of the area during the unloading operation by plant personnel and automatic shutoff valve on the car that can be actuated by several switches throughout the plant.  \n\nThe corresponding scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the lifting of a 3/4 inch relief valve in the refrigeration system due to pressure buildup in the system.  The capacity of the relief valve over a 10 minute duration results in an event that extends less than half a mile from the source.  After the system\u0012s pressure drops below the 250 psig set point, the relief valve reseats and the leak stops.

This event is the failure of the loading hose utilized for the transfer of the chemical from the storage tank to an ISO container for shipment of PMM to an external customer.  This 1-1/2 inch hose failure is assumed to last for 5 minutes with no mitigation.  Distance to the endpoint for this scenario is less than half a mile from the source.  Plant personnel are present in the area during the entire loading procedure to monitor the transfer who can stop the transfer pump in the event of a leak to help mitigate this event.  Also, the loading hose is tested annually to insure its integrity.  \n\nIn all these alternative release scenarios, the same meteorological assumptions apply that are not indicative of actual area norms.  The use of actual averages would significantly reduce the exposures and concentrations detected at the toxic endpoints.\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years, there has been one accident meeting the reporting requirements of the RMP rule.  In November of 1996 a vessel failure and fire occurred in the THPI manufacturing area.  This incident caused equipment damage but did not result in any injuries or chemical release.  Operator error combined with contaminated raw materials caused the overpressurization.  The entire process area was redesigned and rebuilt to prevent a reoccurrence through the use of numerous redundancies, computer interlocks and safety equipment.  The accident was responded to by the local fire department and the plant\u0012s emergency response team and did not result in any off-site impacts.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response \n\nTomen Agro complies with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0012s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard in addition to this Risk Management Program.
