The facility utilizes Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperatures of Milk, Cream, and Ice Cream at 514 Division Street Madison, WI 53704.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a very effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia, a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, is used in an anhydrous form liquefied under pressure in a two stage process.  The refrigeration system consists of a High Pressure Receiver, Evaporators, Condensers, Piping and numerous types of Valves.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  \nSchoep?s Ice Cream Company is dedicated to promoting safe handling of hazardous materials for the sake of the Plant, Employees and Surrounding Community.  The facility is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of federal regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and the EPA?s Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated and maintained in such a way as to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  Also, these programs ensure the development of procedures that serve to minimize the impact of releases in the event that they do occur, as well as outlining proper emergency response steps.\nWorst case Release Scenario: EPA?s ?Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CRF PART 68)? and RMP*Comp Ver. 1.07 are the documents and software primarily used to develop the worst case release scenario. The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  This analysis is not necessarily intended to be used as a rational basis for emergency response planning; rather the purpose of the worst case release analy"

      "SummaryText": "sis is to support dialogue with the community on release prevention.  The worst case release scenario is a model of the potential consequences of an accidental chemical release.   As defined by the EPA, the worst case scenario is a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. It is assumed that this would be the result of a catastrophic failure of the high pressure receiver (HPR) leading to the release of 13,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.   The distance to the endpoint is 1.7 miles.  This is the distance an ammonia vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur.  The worst case release scenario was formed assuming the receiver was filled to capacity and that the entire system charge was released within ten minutes.  \n\nThis situation is unlikely because the HPR was built to 300 psi as opposed to the required 250 psi. this was done in order to mitigate structural failures due to over pressurization.  \nIn addition, Schoep?s Ice Cream has installed a complex ammonia sensor control system to monitor, report, and mitigate accidental releases of ammonia.  It consists of Ammonia Detectors, Sirens, Fire Door Controls, Ventilation, and a Purging/Scrubbing System to ?knock-down? ammonia vapor in the event of a release in the main engine room.    The control system was engineered to be expanded in the future.  This was done to expand the number of mitigation steps that can be taken in order to prevent accidental releases.  \nAlternative Case Scenario:  The EPA?s ?Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CRF PART 68)? and RMP*Comp Ver. 1.07 are the documents and software primarily used to develop the Alternative Case Release Scenario. The Alternative Cause Respond Scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.  The alternative case rel"

These programs include:\n1)    Process safety information\n2)    Process hazard analysis\n3)    Operating procedures\n4)    Employee training  \n5)    Mechanical integrity\n6)    Management of change\n7)    Pre-Startup safety review\n8)    Compliance audits\n9)    Incident investigations\n10)    Employee participation\n11)    Hot Work permits\n12)    Line Break Permits\n13)    Contractor Notification and Safety\n\nEmergency Response Information:  As a part of the PSM program this facility maintains an emergency action plan in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency and to improve the reliability of action taken to mitigate the incident.  The plan includes all information needed to respond to an emergency situation, as well as complete notification instruction for Local, State, and Federal emergency response agencies.  Local hazmat teams have been consulted to ensure a rapid and complete response in the event of an emergency.   \n\nFive Year Accident History:  This facility has had no reportable releases in the last five years\n\nPlanned Changes to improve safety:  In addition to complying with EPA and OSHA regulation and standards, Schoep?s Ice Cream Co. has worked closely with the Wisconsin Department of Commerce, Division of Safety & Buildings to comply with Wisconsin COMM 45, further ensuring the safety of our personnel, the community and the surrounding environment.  It is our goal to continuously improve safety at our facility by carefully monitoring our systems and policies to identify any opportunity for improvement."
