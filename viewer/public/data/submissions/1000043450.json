However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe Lost Creek Compressor Station is located approximately 0.5 miles north of Wamsutter, WY on East Carlton Road.  The plant is designed to process 275 MMSCFD of natural gas.  The natural gas is dehydrated and hydrocarbon liquids are removed, stored in atmospheric tanks and sold as condensate.  The plant process is idled when liquid hydrocarbon content in the feed gas is low enough that processing is not necessary but is always maintained and ready for immediate resumption of operation.  Design liquid production is approximately 120 BPD, but actual production rates have seldom been that high.  The plant has gas compression, dehydration, and utilizes a propane refrigeration process for hydrocarbon liquid recovery.  The plant contains propane (which is used as the refrigerant), mixed hydrocarbon liquids in the process, and natural gas which are all regulated flammables.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic is present at the plant site.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results:\r\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Lost Creek Compressor Station is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) from a catastrophic tank failure involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing propane. Physical limitations of the tank limit the storage inventory to 17,000 lbs. Therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.2 miles per RMP"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into  account in evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario associated with a release of flammable substances at the Lost Creek Compressor Station is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) from a 2\" flange leak for a minute before ignition resulting in 4,700 lbs to be released.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this alternative scenario is <0.1 mile per RMP*Comp.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into  account in evaluating this alternative release scenario\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps:\r\nThis facility was built in accordance with the appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program.  Written programs and procedures cover all of the key elements of the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific steps Include:\r\n1.  Hydrocarbon Detectors;\r\n2.  Process Safety Relief Valves;\r\n3.  Automated Plant Shutdown System.  The plant will be automatically shutdown should key process parameters vary from specified ranges;\r\n4.  Manual valves to permit isolation of various portions of the process;\r\n5.  Appropriately placed portable fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires;\r\n6.  Back-up generator to keep controls powered during a power failure.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nThe Lost Creek Compressor Station was initially started in 2000.  The station has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site and no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nThe Lost Creek Compressor Emergency Response"
