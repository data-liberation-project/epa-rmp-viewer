Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\nThe management and employees of LaSalle County Farm Supply Company are committed to the prevention of any accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release occurs, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\nThe primary activity of the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 140,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/l for the worst-case scenario is 1.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint if .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .1 miles.  This release has the possibilityof extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  The accidential release prevention program.\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidential Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U>S> Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 2"

Five year accident history.\nThere have been no accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n      -   have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n     -   to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\nThe facility has:\n\n     -   a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     -   Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)."
