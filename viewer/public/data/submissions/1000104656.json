The owners, management and employees of Acme Supply Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Saline County LEPC and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility information. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and distribution of products to farmers. The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and is distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for that purpose.\r\n\r\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program. This facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and CGA 2.1-2014 and the Missouri Department of Agriculture Regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n4.\tFive-year accident history. This is a new facility and therefore there has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility, nor to our knowledge, there has not been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Program. The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38. We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 933 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety. Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluat"
