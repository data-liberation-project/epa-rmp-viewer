A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs is used to ensure the safety of  employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that  have been designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n    A description of the facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n    An overview of accidental release prevention programs\n\n    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n    An overview of the emergency response program\n\n    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n    Certification by company official\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Jacksonville facility produces aroma and flavor chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The facility consists of 54 acres in a predominantly residential and commercial neighborhood. The main processes are distillation and reactions. The chemicals in use that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release, are as follows:\n\n\n\nToxics:\n\n\n\nHydrogen Chloride (anhydrous)\n\n\n\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nRenessenz has provided a worst-case scenario and an alternate scenario for off-site consequences of an emergency event involving "
