      "SummaryText": "Helena Industries, LLC is a manufacturer and formulator of agricultural and turf and ornamental chemicals.  Isopropylamine and Aqua-Ammonia are the only chemicals handled on this site that is included in the Risk Management Plan. We receive 70% isopropylamine in trucks several times per year and transfer directly into a formulation blend tank. The Aqua-Ammonia is included in two covered processes.  Covered Process 1 involves unloading 47,000 pounds from a truck into a 30,000 gallon stationary storage tank.  As related to Covered Process 2, aqua-ammonia is transferred from the stationary storage tank through above ground piping that is connected to the mix tanks.  At the mix tanks, the aqua ammonia is mixed with other ingredients (none that are regulated) to manufacture a plant micronutrient formulation.\n\n\n\nHelena Industries, LLC is committed to safety from the senior management level to the employees. Compliance with federal and state regulations is a priority. Several company safety programs are in place; Process Safety Management, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan, Hazard Communication and Community Right-To-Know, Safety Committee, written emergency procedures, incident investigations, management of change, employee training,and HAZWOPER. Each new employee is given Right-To-Know training, and overall Safety Awareness training. These programs combined with safe operating procedures, controls, and equipment maintenance contributes to the overall climate of safe working conditions.\n\n\n\nHelena Industries, LLC plant is located on 47 acres of flat terrain in a rural/industrial area of the community. Within the facility, a storm water drainage system manages water runoff. This system operates under an NPDES Permit issued by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IADNR) and required monitoring of the outflows from this system is done by annual sampling per an Industrial Storm Water permit.

      "SummaryText": " tracks in the paved area directs spills on toward the spill containment basin west of the main building.  There is a sluice gate located at the west end of the trench, which is normally closed during unloading operations, in order to help contain any spill and prevent it from migrating to the basin.  The basin is designed to handle a spill from a full tank truck and a 24 hour, 25 year rain event.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program: \n\nThe facility operates under OSHA Process Safety Management. Additionally, the facility operates under a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC Plan). This plan outlines procedures for plant operations pertaining to oil products and by extension all other liquid chemical products handled at this facility. This plan covers operations pertaining to transfer, loading, unloading, piping, storage, and containment of liquid chemical products. The isopropylamine is transferred over a paved surface graded to the trench for spill containment. The aqua-ammonia tank sits in a cement dike with over flow into a secondary spill containment.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response: \n\nFacility personnel do not respond to emergency situations. They do clean up incidental spills of chemical products. The facility has coordinated its response actions with the local fire department. The fire department annually receives the facility EPCRA report.  We have training on the emergency plan annually and evacuation drills at least annually.\n\n\n\nAccident History: \n\nThere are no accidents to report at this facility.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes:\n\nTo add a new process using a regulated chemical unloading isopropylamine from trucks."
