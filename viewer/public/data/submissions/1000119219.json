Continuous review of standard operating procedures (SOP's) and mechanical integrity programs help to ensure that the chlorine system is operated and maintained in a safe manner. The Department provides formal training for all operators and Maintenance personnel focusing on chlorine safety. Annual audits are conducted by representatives of the Parish Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to familiarize themselves with the chlorine system.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Policies: Operators at the Luling Oxidation Pond will not respond to leaks beyond their ability to control through the use of valves. In the event of such a release, plant personnelwill notify EOC and evacuate the area. EOC will establish the safe perimeter and begin public notification. EOC will handle all emergency procedures and evacuation. The facility is included in the Local Emergency Planning Committee's community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nTHE WESTBANK WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\r\n\r\nThe Luling Oxidation Pond (Pond) is a 3.2 million gallons per day oxidation pond that serves the Luling area of St. Charles Parish. Treated effluent from the plant is discharged to Wetlands. Disinfection of the effluent is accomplished by injecting chlorine into the effluent box. Chlorine is stored in a maximum of six one ton cylinders. The Pond is owned and operated by the Parish.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM and CHLORINE RELEASE PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe critical elements that the Parish uses to prevent accidental releases are the recently reviewed and updated Standard Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity Program, and Training Program. These three programs have a significant impact in the continued safe operation of the chlorine s"

Instead, the Emergency Action Plan will be implemented which notifies the Parish EOC. EOC will provide support and technical assistance to contain chlorine releases beyond the ability of Parish personnel.
