The contractor\u00bfs safety procedures were last reviewed in March 2002.\n\nPre-Start-Up Safety Reviews (PSSR) is used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality standpoint.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete.  Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters.  The last Pre-Start-Up Safety review was conducted on 3/21/99.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations.  Equipment used to store, process, or handle acetylene has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.  The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria fro acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.  This program was reviewed in March 2002.\n\nHazardous work or non-routine work is controlled in a consistent manner.

This Program was reviewed in March 2002 for both employees and contractors.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include modifications for equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \u00bfreplacement in kind\u00bf.  A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.  Management of Change procedures was reviewed March 2002.\n\nProcess incidents, which result in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of acetylene, are investigated, including \u00bfnear misses\u00bf, within 48 hours of the incident.  The purpose of the incident investigation is to identify the underlying causes of the incident and to implement corrective action to prevent similar incidents and avoid past mistakes.  Process incidents are investigated by a Team, which include both management and employees and is multidisciplinary.

The facilities Emergency Response plan was reviewed and tested in March 2002.\n\nThe facility receives a compliance audit in accordance with EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Standard Part 68 at least once every three years.  The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the risk management system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to ensure compliance.

A Protocol Policy has been developed to ensure that proper follow-up is accomplished.\n\nAirgas will make available all information, including any Trade Secret information as it relates to compliance with this regulation.\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan, which has been integrated with local community Emergency Response Plan.  All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work.  The Emergency Plan is tested and critiqued twice a year to insure that it is current.  Changes are made and reviewed if deficiencies are found.

The management and employees of the Waukesha facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of acetylene.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, storage and distribution of acetylene.  Acetylene is manufactured by the addition of Calcium Carbide into water in a reactor vessel.  A chemical reaction takes place and the acetylene is then compressed into cylinders containing an inert filler material and acetone.  The acetylene dissolves into the acetone in the cylinder.  Each cylinder is checked for weight of acetylene to insure that they have the proper amount of product.  Cylinders are removed from the fill lines and placed into storage for shipment.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of acetylene.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.\n\nWritten process safety information was developed for the acetylene system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), which assists management and employees in making decisions from improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of acetylene.  The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process identifying potential failure p"
