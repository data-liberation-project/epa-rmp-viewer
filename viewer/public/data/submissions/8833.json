The Facility Policy\n\n    The owners, Management, and employees of LaPorte Co. Co-op, Union Mills Branch committed to the \n    prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the\n    facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and\n    minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n   - This facility receives & stores grain from farmers and stores and blends fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n   - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production   \n     nutrients. \n   - The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity handled would be the   \n     unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n   a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank  \n       released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which\n       represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design  \n       standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.10 miles.\n   b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in\n       a transfer hose,  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .60 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of \n    Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the  \n    standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \n    \"Stor"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n   - Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge,  \n     have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or  \n     environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\n   - The facility has:\n\n   a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n   b. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information  \n       as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n   c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120,  \n       including pre-emergency planning and employee training. \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to  \n    assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety\n    recommendations for implementation at this time."
