Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWhiteWave Foods became the legal owner of the property on November 18, 2010.  Prior to that date the property was previously owned and operated by Americana Foods for the production of ice cream and frozen dessert products.  Since the purchase of the property, WhiteWave Foods has completely renovated the building and its anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  This is our initial RMP for this property and we anticipate charging the newly installed refrigeration system on November 28, 2011.\r\n\r\nWhiteWave Foods is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration system. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Dallas Fire Department and the Dallas County LEPC for emergency response support.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThis facility is primarily used for the production and storage of soy based dairy products.  The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  The new ammonia system contains approximately 44,690 pounds of ammonia.\r\n\r\nDue to the  and characteristics of our ammonia system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is"
