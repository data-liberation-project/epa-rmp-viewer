The program must consist of a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  Additionally, the operator must describe the site's risk management program in a risk management plan (RMP). However, the regulation provides for 3 different programs of compliance dependent upon the eligibility criteria of covered processes including, but not limited to, the potential impact of chemical releases as identified in the hazard assessment.  For example, chemical processes which meet the criteria for program level 1 and program level 2 have very minimal requirements for release prevention programs and emergency response as compared to those for program level 3.  \n\nAt General Chemical's Richmond Works, one listed chemical, Oleum, is managed on-site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria. No chemicals are managed on-site under program level 1 or program level 2 criteria. As identified in this plan, Richmond Works is in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for management of Oleum.\n\nThis RMP describes Richmond Work's risk management program which includes a hazard assessment, release prevention program and emergency response program. The hazard assessment includes one worst case release scenario and one alternative case release scenario. The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with "

However, if a release does occur, Richmond Works has prepared employees in conjunction with local emergency response groups, to respond to a release.\n\n2.0 Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nGeneral Chemical's Richmond Works produces Sulfuric Acid and Electronic Grade Sulfuric Acid. Oleum is produced as an intermediate chemical in a state-of-the-art facility that was installed in 1997.  As one of the most advanced plants of its kind, it produces ultra-high-purity Electronic Grade Sulfuric Acid having overall ionic contaminant levels of less than 400 parts per trillion.  Sulfuric Acid and Electronic Grade Sulfuric Acid are used in many applications including pharmaceuticals, batteries, and plastics.  A major use of the acid produced at this facility is in the production of gasoline at a neighboring refinery.  The maximum quantity of Oleum on-site is 72,000 pounds.\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\nUSEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Provisions require that General Chemical provide information about the worst case release scenario and alternative case release scenario for Oleum handled at its Richmond Works.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n3.1    Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario as defined by the USEPA is a hypothetical accident for one of the chemicals at a site.  It assumes that all safety systems in the facility simultaneously fail and that all of the chemical in the largest container holding it at a site is released in a very short time. USEPA designated table defines the distance the material will travel until it disperses so much that it is no longer hazardous.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario at General Chemical's Richmond Works assumes that a process vessel containing Oleum fails. The USEPA requires us to assume that all safety and release prevention systems simultaneously fail, except for the secondary containment currently installed around "

The USEPA designated table states that the material released would travel 4.0 miles before it reaches a non-hazardous concentration. \n\n3.2    Alternative Case Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative case release scenario is a more credible hypothetical, site-specific chemical release. It takes into account safety and release prevention systems and procedures used at the plant to control releases. It is more realistic than the worst case release scenario; it is calculated based on the DEGADIS air dispersion modeling program, and is used to plan a facility's emergency response to accidents.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario for Oleum at Richmond Works assumes Oleum would be lost due to failure of a transfer line during the transfer process.  It takes into account plant safety systems designed to limit a release.  The DEGADIS modeling program has determined that the material released would travel 0.52 miles before reaching a non-hazardous concentration. \n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps \n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operations of our processes.  The accidental release prevention program implemented at Richmond Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the risk management program including:\n\n* Process Safety Information - Information relating to the hazards of the chemical(s), process technology and equipment information is maintained to ensure proper operation.\n\n* Mechanical Integrity - Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis - Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the operating conditions.\n\n* Standard Operating Procedu"

This incident, and the resulting procedural and technological changes are described below:\n\nAccident Description\n\nOn July 26, 1993, approximately 3.9 tons of sulfur trioxide was released to the atmosphere from a railcar during off-loading.  The pressurized air and sulfur trioxide in the vapor space escaped through a safety rupture disc installed in the dome on top of the car, and poured through the opening for approximately three hours until the disc was replaced.  The Contra Costa County Health Service Department activated the Community Alert Network.  Castro Street and neighboring streets were closed to vehicular traffic until the release was stopped.\n\nUnderlying Causes\n\nThe"

      "SummaryText": " release was caused by a sudden increase of pressure in the vapor space inside the railcar.  \n\nMeasures taken to avoid reoccurrence\n\nThe facility no longer stores Oleum in railcars. The facility has chosen to eliminate the storage and transport of Oleum by implementation of the Oleum Risk Reduction Project.  The Project consists of manufacturing Electronic Grade Sulfuric Acid on-site instead of storing and shipping Oleum to General Chemical's Bay Point Works (approximately 30 miles east).\n\n6.0       Emergency Response Program\n\nGeneral Chemical's Richmond Works maintains an emergency response plan, which addresses all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the administering agency - Contra Costa Health Services Hazardous Materials Division.  In addition, the facility is a member of Contra Costa County CAER Group, Inc., which is comprised of local government officials, local emergency response officials, industry representatives and community representatives.  Richmond Works, Contra Costa Health Services and the local fire departments have coordinated communication to notify the public quickly, if necessary, as well as facilitate quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic CAER meetings, Richmond Works conducts periodic emergency response drills that involve emergency response organizations.    \n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRichmond Works performs periodic process hazard analyses to evaluate and to strive continuously to improve health, safety and environmental performance as technical developments, scientific understanding, consumer and community needs, and regulatory requirements evolve and change, some of which result in process modifications.
