      "SummaryText": "Haveman Grain Co., Inc., Murray, Ne., is a small grain elevator near the UP Railroad.  The railroad cuts through the town, with the bigger part of the town being on the west side of the tracks.  Murray, Ne. has a population of around 420 people.  The elevator is on the west side of the tracks, with Railroad Ave running on the west side of the property.  The Anhydrous tanks are on the east side of the property with  a large Morton building on the west of them and then Railroad Ave west of the building.  We only have anhydrous in the tanks during the fertilizer season which would be 30 to 40 days in the fall, November and part of December, and then 30 to 60 days in the spring, last of March and into May. We try to have them as empty as possible when the season is over.  We have never had an anhydrous release and try to take care with the handling of the product. The local fire department has been trained in anhydrous realeases and knows our facility.  Haveman Grain handles grain, feed, seed, chemicals and fertilizer.  We have been in business 24 years."
