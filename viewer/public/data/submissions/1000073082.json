      "SummaryText": "The Dover Chemical Corporation plant manufactures a variety of fire retardant and surfactant chemicals for customers who make consumer and commercial products. Certain raw materials and by-products are toxic chemicals that are regulated under EPA Risk Management Programs regulations that can be hazardous if released to the air in large quantities.\n\nDover Chemical Corporation is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities. We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. If there is an emergency, we will immediately mobilize our emergency response team to contain and minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through local emergency management agencies. \n\n\n\nToxic Regulated Substances Handled\n\nChlorine:  Chlorine is a raw material that is delivered as a pressurized liquid in rail cars and is a gas at atmospheric temperature and pressure.  This material has a pungent, irritating odor and poses a severe inhalation hazard.  \n\n\n\nBromine:  Bromine is a raw material delivered in tank trucks and iso-containers.  It is a volatile liquid at atmospheric temperature and pressure.  Bromine has a pungent odor and releases irritating fumes.  Both liquid and vapor are corrosive to all body tissues and may cause serious burns\n\n\n\nAq. HCL:  Aq. HCl is a product of the chlorination and phosphites processes. Anhydrous HCl is generated in the production of our products and is immediately absorbed into water to make the product acid.  This acid is shipped to customers via tank trucks and rail cars.  Hydrochloric Acid has a pungent, irritating odor and poses a severe inhalation and skin hazard.  \n\n\n\nChloroform:  Chloroform is a solvent used in the chlorinations processes.  Chloroform is a liquid at atmospheric temperature and pressure.  During the ch"

This conversion results in the solvent used in the process is approximately 50/50 chloroform/carbon tetrachloride. Chloroform is delivered via tank trucks. Chloroform has a pleasant ethereal odor that acts as a relatively potent anesthetic.  Inhalation of chloroform vapors damages the central nervous system.\n\n\n\nPhosphorous Trichloride: PCl3 is a raw material used in the phosphites processes.  PCl3 is a liquid at atmospheric temperatures and pressures and can be delivered in rail cars, tank trucks or iso-containers. \n\n\n\nPhosphorus trichloride has a pungent, irritating odor similar to that of hydrochloric acid. Both liquid and vapor are corrosive to all body tissues.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nTo minimize the potential for a chemical release, our facility maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving a hazardous chemical. The prevention program has twelve elements designed to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nOur facility is committed to personnel safety, public safety, and continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance. Based on this commitment, the EHS Manager and the PSM/RMP Leader have assumed responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program. We have also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the twelve prevention program elements.\n\nOur prevention measures include, but are not limited to, the use of:\n\n- Chlorine and hydrochloric acid process area detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n\n- Fence line chlorine and hydrochloric acid detectors to assist in emergency response;\n\n- Operator attended truck loading and unloading operations;\n\n- Automatic shutoff systems for chlorine unloading operations;\n\n- Video camera on the rail c"

If an emergency did occur, plant personnel will immediately activate our emergency response team to contain and minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through local emergency management agencies.\n\nPlanning to Maintain a Safe Operation\n\n\n\nDover Chemical continually works to safely manage the hazards of chemicals to protect employees and the community we serve. The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices. Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analyses and coordinate with the community emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\n "
