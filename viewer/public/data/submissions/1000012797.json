      "SummaryText": "FS demonstrates their commitment to preventing releases to the environment by being actively involved with the Livingston County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  GFS has developed in conjunction with the Livingston County LEPC a Chemical Emergency Response Plan & Standard Operating Procedures (Emergency Response Plan) for GFS's Brighton Distribution Center.  The stated purpose of this Emergency Response Plan is:\n* To ensure the safety of Emergency Response Team Personnel during a hazardous materials emergency.\n* To provide adequate safety precautions in protecting Gordon Food Service employees and the public from harm caused by a chemical release.\n* To provide the Emergency Response Team with management direction during all operations directly related to a hazardous material emergency.\n\nGFS has developed and trained a HAZMAT team, in accordance with all applicable OSHA regulations; to implement their established policies and the procedures established in this Emergency Response Plan.  The HAZMAT team is supported and sufficient resources have been provided to this HAZMAT team by GFS's upper management.\nSite Description and Substances Handled\nGordon Food Service (GFS) distributes general grocery items to restaurants, cafeterias, and Marketplace stores throughout the Midwest.  GFS utilizes refrigerated warehouses (Distribution Centers) to receive product from venders, which is then distributed to Marketplace stores and clients within a 250-mile radius.  The Brighton Distribution Center for GFS is located in an industrial park east of the City of Brighton, Michigan. \n\nThe structure of the Brighton Distribution Center consists of a warehouse building subdivided to house building maintenance; administration; dry, refrigerated, and frozen product inventory; and unloading and loading dock areas.  Refrigerated and frozen inventory cooling at the Brighton Distribution Center is provided by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system located within the Distribution "

      "SummaryText": "Center.  The storage and use of the anhydrous ammonia is the only substance used by GFS that is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The refrigeration system at the Distribution Center contains approximately 23,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The refrigeration system consist of the following basic elements:\n* compressor,\n* high pressure receiver,\n* liquid pump,\n* evaporator,\n* condenser, and \n* associated piping and valves.\n\nRefer to the attached process flow diagram for further design of the refrigeration system at the Brighton Distribution Center.  This refrigeration system is a closed loop system that requires minimal amounts of additional anhydrous ammonia on a yearly basis.  \nAmmonia System Design \nThe major components of the refrigeration system including the high-pressure receiver at the Brighton Distribution Center are within the warehouse facility itself in an enclosed concrete block room (compressor room).  The chillers are suspended from the ceiling of the warehouse throughout the refrigerated and frozen food product areas.  The only exterior components (outside of the Distribution Center building itself) of the refrigeration system is the condenser and associated piping and valves.  The compressor room has only two access points.  One access point is a door that opens into the warehouse itself and the second access point is a door that leads directly to the outside of the facility that remains continuously locked from the inside. \nWorst-Case Release Scenario \nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined a worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint\".  Basically, a worst-case release is a catastrophic event that destroys the process and/or storage vessels and causes and immediate release of all stored materials.  In order to determine the impact of a worst case accidental release of ammo"

RMP*Comp(tm), developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was the model utilized to perform the calculations for the offsite consequence analysis. The following site-specific parameters and required default parameters were utilized to conduct the offsite consequence analysis for the Brighton Distribution Center:\n* Quantity of ammonia liquefied under pressure: 12,114 pounds (present in the largest single vessel - high-pressure receiver (site-specific value)\n* Height of Release:  ground level (default value)\n* Release Duration: 10 minutes (default value)\n* Mitigation Measures:  Release in enclosed space in direct contact with outside air due to the presence of two doors one of which leads outside (default value)\n* Topography: Urban Surroundings (site-specific value)\n* Wind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (default value)\n* Stability Class: F (default value)\n* Air Temperature: 77 degrees Fahrenheit (default value)\n* Compressor Room volume:  59,616 ft3 (site-specific value)\n\nSince the High Pressure Receiver is located within the warehouse, a calculation was performed to assess if the building would fail as a result of the release.  The following equation was utilized to determine the building strength as recommended by the EPA:\nCompressor Room Volume/Quantity of ammonia \n59,616 ft3/12,114 pounds = 4.92 ft3/pounds\n\nSince the answer is greater than 0.1ft3/pound, then the building will be able to sustain and contain an ammonia release.  Therefore, the default values for a Mitigated Release will be able to be utilized for calculating the estimated distance to the Toxic Endpoint.  Next, site specific values and default values were input into the RMP*Comp(tm) model to calculate the estimated distance to the Toxic Endpoint.  The calculated result is 1.0 miles.  \n\nIn order for a release of this magnitude to occur, all automated "

Basically, a catastrophic event like a tornado, earthquake, or explosion would have to destroy the High Pressure Receiver located inside the warehouse instantaneously to meet the assumptions required by a worst case scenario.  Since the High Pressure Receiver is located in the Compressor Room that has limited access and has no vehicle traffic it is highly unlikely that a catastrophe of this magnitude would occur damaging this vessel.  \n\nAdditionally, the compressor room has only one door that leads to the outside of the facility and it is locked from the inside.  This door is only used for emergency purposes.  Therefore, there are no direct outlets present for a release of anhydrous ammonia to impact outdoor air.  \nAlternate Release Scenario\nGFS has reviewed their ammonia refrigeration system to determine a more likely release scenario.  The Process Hazard Analysis conducted in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 indicated that a release caused by a hole in piping caused by corrosion or a leaking valve along the piping run located on the roof of the warehouse is a more plausible release scenario.  Under normal operating conditions, the rooftop piping and associated valves are operating under 175 psig.  The alternate release scenario was calculated assuming a valve was damaged creating a 1.5 inch hole (diameter of the valve).  The release rate was calculated utilizing the Bernoulli Equation:\nQR = HA x (203)(Pg)1/2\nWhere:    QR = Release rate (pounds/minute)\n    HA = Hole area (square inches)\n    Pg = Gauge pressure (psig)\n\nUsing this equation, the release rate was calculated to be 4,972 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per minute could be released if the valve was damaged.  Inputting the calculated release rate of 4,972 pounds/minute and the default release duration of 60 minutes into the RMP*Comp(tm) model, an estimated distance to the Toxic Endpoint was calculated to be "

      "SummaryText": "0.5 miles.  This radius of impact is significantly smaller than the worst case scenario however, it does meet the requirement for off-site impact.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario model assumes that all of the engineered fail safe measures present in the ammonia refrigeration system at GFS including automatic and manual alarms and shutoff mechanisms fail.  Therefore, the odds of the alternate release scenario described above occurring are still very low.  Additionally, that ammonia vapor cloud that would form when a release occurred would dissipate in the direction of the wind predominantly west-southwest.  This would significantly reduce the ammonia radius of impact by only affecting the public located immediately downwind of the release.  \nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nTo prevent the accident release scenarios described above and others outlined in GFS's Process Hazard Analysis at the Brighton Distribution Center, GFS has implemented an aggressive prevention program within the last four years.  GFS has made a commitment to understand the environmental aspects and safety aspects of the refrigeration system operations.  In response to this increased knowledge and awareness, GFS has devoted much time and effort to insuring the refrigeration system at the Distribution Center is working efficiently, effectively, and safely for not only on-site employees but also the residents and public areas surrounding the Distribution Center.  \n\nGFS is subject to the OSHA Process Safety management (PSM) requirements.  Therefore, the PSM GFS has instituted is in compliance with these standards, at minimum.  GFS's prevention program includes the following:\n* Daily manual and automated pressure checks of temperature and pressures in engine room.\n* Weekly inspection of exterior insulation, valve stations, and piping runs.\n* Bi-weekly leak checks of all valves and valve stations.\n* Preventative maintenance program based on observations from"
