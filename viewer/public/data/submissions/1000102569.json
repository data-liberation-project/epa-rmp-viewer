Accident prevention includes designing safe operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of operating facilities.  ConocoPhillips's policies and dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help to prevent accidental releases.  \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Helena Stabilizer, located in Karnes County, Texas, is owned by ConocoPhillips Company and operated by the ConocoPhillips L48 Business Unit.  The Helena Stabilizer is an oil stabilization facility that recovers and separates hydrocarbon liquids.  Inlet streams from wellhead oil production facilities are delivered via pipeline or tanker trucks to the facility.  The recovered hydrocarbon liquids and gas are transported via pipeline or are trucked offsite for further processing and eventual sales.  The Helena Stabilizer's operation includes separation of the inlet stream, stabilization (distillation), storage, trucking and compression.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the Helena Stabilizer's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were on site in quantities above the threshold quantities.  [Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following list of flammable substances are handled in quantities above the substanc"

There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at this facility.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Helena Stabilizer does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. Since this facility does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure for flammables. This hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  The Ethane-Propane-Butane-Pentane Mix was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of the entire inventory in the largest storage vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of RMP*Comp modeling.\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because the scenario's assumption was the instantaneous release of the entire content in the vessel.  We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors and are part of a rigorous Mechanical Integrity Program which ensures all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected to prevent leakage or failure.  In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected, and pressure tested before they are placed in service.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulations require the operator to model a single \"alternative release scenario\" for all regulated flammable substances.

The alternative release scenario if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of RMP*Comp modeling.   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Helena Stabilizer adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These policies and procedures include and embrace the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements of the Risk Management Program that are currently in operation at the Helena Stabilizer.  The Helena Stabilizer has aligned and integrated its safety management programs at a high level with the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program regulations for consistency and effectiveness.  As a result, this overview describes the safety management system that is in place for each of the safety management program elements, which also make up the Risk Management Program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAll employees and contractors at the Helena Stabilizer are involved and participate in all facets of Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention.

These initiatives are focused on facility processes, general worker safety (including slips, trips, and falls), and off-the-job safety.  These initiatives include safety teams that have been chartered to improve safety, both on and off the job.  These safety teams typically have members from various functional areas including operations, maintenance, engineering, and management to ensure the team has a broad perspective, which leads to better ideas to improve safety.  The employees and management are also supporting an employee driven Behavioral Based Safety program.  This allows employees and managers the opportunity to audit the safety performance of their peers, and give immediate constructive feedback on safety performances.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Helena Stabilizer has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the facility's operations and processes are identified and minimized.  This is a systematic procedure in which each part of the process is examined to identify all of the potential hazards associated with the process, and to ensure that appropriate recommendations are developed and implemented to eliminate or control the potential hazards.\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis procedure utilized at the Helena Stabilizer is carried out by a team of functional experts from engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety, who work with a PHA Facilitator to identify and evaluate all of the potential hazards that could possibly result in a release of a regulated substance.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. Whenever a process modification is made, the procedures are revised as appropriate to cover the modification.  The procedures are kept current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThese procedures are used in employee training and are readily available to employees for use in their daily job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Helena Stabilizer employs a comprehensive training program for all employees.  All operating and maintenance personnel receive facility-specific process overview training.  Each employee receives training on: \n\n(1) An overview of the process.\n(2) Safety and health hazards.\n(3) Applicable maintenance procedures. \n(4) Emergency response plans.\n(5) Applicable safe work practices.\n\nThey are thereby trained in the specific knowledge, skills, and procedures needed to safely conduct their work.  In addition, each operator receives facility-specific training on how to operate the facility, including detailed training on the operating procedures, including startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, and emergency operations.  As part of this training, an operator in training is paired with an experienced operator, as a mentor, to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate, through peer review and skills demonstration, the knowledge level needed to perform their duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, then and only then, they are allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a high level.  This refresher training is provided as often as necessary and no less than every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for e"

This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  The MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.  A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training regarding the process modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\nThe Helena Stabilizer conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure before startup of the modified process or unit that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  Another key purpose of the PSSR's is to ensure that all personnel have been trained on the modification, including any revisions to the operating procedures or to the safety systems and controls.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that all personnel and supporting systems are operationally ready to operate the newly-modified pro"
