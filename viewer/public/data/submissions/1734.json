Facility policy\n     The owners, management, and employees of Padonia Grain Farmers are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility information\n     The primary activity at this facility affected by the Risk Management Plan is the storage and retail sales of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by farmers.  The maximum quantity stored would be 100,000 lbs in our 12,000 storage tank and all nurse tanks.\n\n3.  The worst-case release and alternative release scenario\n     Because the Reserve Branch of Padonia Grain Farmers sits in an open area without a lot of large buildings or trees nearby to provide plume obstructions, we considered it to be in a rural location.\n     The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank and nurse tanks due to some catastrophic event like a derailed train striking and substantially damaging all anhdrous storage vessels causing a total release over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released wuld be 10,000 lbs.  The distance to the endpoint of the release is 11.4 miles.\n     The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is based on the most likely potential incident that would produce an offsite leak, would be the overfilling of the storage tank that would in turn result in the failure of the pop-off valves.  If we assume that the entire contents of the tank were involved over a two hour time frame, the quantity released would be 60,000 lbs.  The distance to the endpoint would be .59 miles.\n\n4.   The accidental release prevention program\n     Padonia Grain Farmers, In"

This manual includes step by step procedures for day to day operations as well as periodic checks to ensure proper equipment use and maintenance.  These procedures were developed and implemented with regulations set forth by OSHA and ANSII in mind.\n\n5.   The five year accident history\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.   The emergency response\n     The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standards 20 CFR 1910.38, and provided state and local authrities the emergency planning and community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintentance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia recommendations for implementation at this time."
