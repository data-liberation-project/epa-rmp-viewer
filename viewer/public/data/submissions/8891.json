The use of chlorine as a disinfectant; inactivates numerous pathogens potentially present in raw drinking water supplies. The same properties that make chlorine an essential part of protecting the public from waterborne diseases make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our employees. Our emeregency response plan is based on the EPA's model for WWTP plants and the Chlorine Institutes Pamphlet # 64 Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The Emergency Response Plan includes notification of ( 911 )  Mission Fire Department Haz-Mat response protocol. The Mission Fire Department is the primary first responder in all chemical spill or release emergencies in Mission , Texas.  The primary purpose of this facility is to provide drinking water for the City of Mission,Texas. Chorine is delivered from the vendor in DOT approved ton containers on a flat bed trailer equiped with a hydraulically operated unloading device. The inventory of chlorine stored at this facility is 10,000 pounds.    The worst case release scenario of a one ton container would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine. It is assumed that the contents would be released as a vapor , which is heavier than air. The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/l ( 3ppm) would be .9 miles or less than 1 mile as determined by the EPA  RMP COMP model   An alternative release scenario  of a hole in a gas chlorine delivery tube off of chlorine regulator woul"

This facility complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The handling of chlorine in this facility is in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institutes Chlorine Manual and pamphlet #'s 6,63,64,65,73,74,89,151,155 and 162. We have not had any accidental releases or incidents in the last 5 years.  This facility was constructed in 1997 to current Standard Building Code Standards as well design engineering for chemical applications . We will continue to improve our operations by incorporating new ideas and principles in responsible safety and care."
