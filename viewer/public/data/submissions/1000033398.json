This Plan was prepared in accordance with the Federal Risk Management Plan [Clean Air Act 112(r)] and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP - Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5) Program requirements. This is the first 5-year update to the original RMP that was prepared in 2008.\n\nThe WWTP chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are subject to the federal RMP program because of the quantity stored. This plan meets the requirements the federal RMP.\n\nThe LCWD has also a water system network that uses chlorine for treatment at individual well stations.  Separate accidental release prevention plans have been prepared for each water well facility that has chlorine.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nAt the LCWD WWTP, located at 909 Myrna Avenue in Yuba County, California, chlorine is stored in up to eight one-ton cylinders in a building that has leak detectors and an automatic ventilation system with an air scrubber. Up to four one-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide are stored in a separate room that has leak detection that triggers self closing doors and ventilation shut off.\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe regulated substances at the WWTP are anhydrous chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5) and anhydrous sulfur dioxide (CAS # 7446-09-5). \n\n\n\nFEDERAL RMP, CALARP AND OSHA PSM APPLICABILITY\n\nThe Federal Risk Management Program (RMP) program and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) programs require facilities that handle regulated substances on the federal extremely hazardous substances list (or the state list of regulated substances), in quantities greater than federal or state threshold quantities, to submit a RMP plan. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide quantity at the WWTP exceeds the federal RMP threshold values. Therefore, an Accidental Release Prevention Plan is require"

The chemicals are subject to CalARP requirements until it is injected into water (reducing the concentration to below 1 percent). LCWD stores up to 16,000 pounds of chlorine and up to 8,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide at the WWTP.\n\nThe quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide are over the federal Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) thresholds.  Therefore, both processes are in the RMP/CalARP program level 3 category. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\nLCWD has not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nLCWD has developed an accidental release prevention program to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n -     Continuation of the employee participation program to ensure that all personnel working with chlorine and sulfur dioxide are aware of the CalARP program and relevant Process Safety information, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\n\n -     Process Hazard Review to identify, evaluate and control risks associated with process hazards and the regulated substances. \n\n -     Maintenance of updated, accurate and written standard operating procedures. All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n\n -     Initial safety training and three-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff working with covered processes.\n\n -     Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same level of safety training that LCWD provides for its own employees for working on or around the covered processes.\n\n -     Review of the design of all equipment and contr"

The key elements of the Emergency Response Plan are as follows:\n\n -     All LCWD staff members that work with chlorine or sulfur dioxide are trained in emergency response procedures.\n\n -     Guidelines for leak/spill confirmation, classification and remediation, and evacuation are provided.\n\n -     Important emergency contact numbers are listed.\n\n -     The chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage facilities are equipped with electronic gas detectors. The gas detectors have visual and audible alarms and alert LCWD when the preset amount of gas is detected. The WWTP chlorine facility has a scrubber that automatically starts when a specified level of gas is detected. \n\n -     In the event of a large release, LCWD would immediately contact the Fire Department. The Fire Department would conduct emergency response and repair the leak. LCWD has staff trained to handle the remediation of minor leaks/spills.\n\n\n\nHYPOTHETICAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Risk Management Plan must assess the downwind impacts of hypothetical accidental releases.

The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for various compounds were specified by EPA, and are generally concentrations that would cause no physical harm but could interfere with people's ability to leave the area. The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for the RMP chemicals at the facility are 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of chlorine in air and 0.0078 mg/l of sulfur dioxide in air. In accordance with EPA's rule, hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide. \n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nLCWD will continue to improve safety by continually updating process safety information, providing employee training, encouraging employee participation and incorporating system improvements identified during scheduled hazard reviews. \n\n\n\n"
