If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Montgomery County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.\tFacility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in nurse tanks designed for this purpose.  The anhydrous ammonia facility is in operation on a seasonal basis only (approximately three months of the year). The facility is manned during this time period.\n\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario \n\nAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).  In the event of an accidental release or emergency it is the policy of Service and Supply Cooperative employees to immediately dial 911 to notify local emergency services.  \n\n5.\tFive-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the"
