The branch located in Kansas City is one of the outlying distribution branches. G.S. Robins has specialized in serving the unique chemical needs of the Midwest. The Kansas City branch is involved with chemical storage and transportation. Employees at the branch location handle the chemical containers, but do not open any of the containers.\n\nG.S. Robins and Company is a long time member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD). Through the NACD, G.S. Robins has committed and pledged to constantly improve the management and handling of chemicals by following NACDs Responsible Distribution Process (RDP). RDP is a system that promotes continuous improvement in the health, safety, and environmental performance of all member companies. G.S. Robins? implementation of the RDP includes a commitment to comply with relevant environmental, health, and safety regulations. The senior management at G.S. Robins has formally accepted these guiding principles. \n\nRDP includes guiding principles for all aspects of environmental, health, and safety. These include: communication with emergency response officials, operating our facilities in a safe manner, responding to community concerns about chemicals, and to make health, safety and environment a priority. In order to verify that G.S. Robins has complied with the guiding principles of RDP, the NACD conducts a third party on-site verification every three years.\n\nThe primary activities at the Kansas City branch consist of the following: drum and tote storage, material loading and unloading, and transportation. The GSR-Kansas City facility has 1 RMP chemical at or above the threshold value. This chemical is: Chlorine. The facility has one Process identified with this chemical above the threshold. The process is Storage.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case scenario for the GSR-"

      "SummaryText": "Kansas City facility involves chlorine. Chlorine is stored on-site in 2,000 lb cylinders and 150 lb cylinders. The worst-case scenario demonstrates all of the chlorine on-site being released at one time. The maximum amount on-site is 9,100 lbs. The scenario would either be a fire or explosion causing a complete release of all material at one time. The scenario has an offsite impact radius of 2.1 miles (estimated distance to Toxic Endpoint, 0.0087mg/L as specified in 40CFR68, Appendix A). The modeling was done using RMP Comp. The likelihood of this scenario taking place is remote. The chlorine is stored in the facility?s inside storage area. G.S. Robins does not have the maximum amount of inventory on-site at all times. \n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\nThe alternative scenario at GSR-Kansas City consists of a release from just one of the cylinders described above. The cylinders are stored on-site and ship to outlying GSR branches or directly to customers. The Alternative Scenarios represent incidents that are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. \n?    Scenario 1: Release of chlorine from a 2000 lb cylinder: Toxic Endpoint (0.0078mg/L) = 0.9 miles\n?    Scenario 2: Release of chlorine from a 150 lb cylinder: Toxic Endpoint (0.0078mg/L) = 0.7 miles\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nG.S. Robins and Company has NOT had a reportable accidental release in the past five years at this site.\n\n\nEMERGENCY REPSONSE PROGRAM\nThe G.S. Robins and Company Emergency Action Plan consists of guidance for evacuation, fires, spills, tornadoes and bomb threats. In addition, the plan contains information on emergency contacts, plant layouts, and emergency reporting requirements.\n\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nG.S. Robins and Company is committed to improving safety and sustaining the environment. This is a continuous process and we are constantly seeking input. We audit internally and have third parties audit periodically. We constantly train our employees in all aspects of safety and will continue to "
