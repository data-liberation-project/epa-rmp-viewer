On June 1, 2009, the nylon division of Solutia, including the Pensacola site, was purchased by SK Capital Partners, and became a wholly owned subsidary of SK; given the name Ascend Performance Materials LLC.  Pensacola is one of the five chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company. Ascend has approximately 1800 employees. \n\nBuilt in 1953, the Pensacola Plant is situated on a 1900 acre tract, 12 miles north of the City of Pensacola, on the Escambia River. Over 600 acres are presently in use for manufacturing.\n\nStaffing at Pensacola is currently 700 Ascend employees and 200 permanent contract employees.   Ascend is one of the world's largest producers of nylon polymer chips for the automotive and electrical industries, as well as nylon for carpet staple. Some of the adipic acid produced on-site is sold outside the nylon markets, where it goes into food additives -- Jell-o and No Salt to provide tartness.  The facility also produces maleic anhydride, which utilizes butane as a raw material.  The maleic anhydride facility is owned by Huntsman Corp., but staffed and run by Ascend personnel \n\nMost major raw materials (ie. Anhydrous Ammonia and Butane are the two regulated substances) arrive at the plant by barge on the Escambia River - 7 miles from the lntercoastal Waterway. Rail and truck shipments of butane supplement the barges. Butane barges can hold up to a maximum of 3.3 million pounds, remain under the control of the carrier, and normally there are no more than two barg"

Also tanker trucks of butane are occasionally unloaded, with the largest containing 45,000 pounds. We only receive anhydrous ammonia by barge and it remains under the carrier's control. Although we have never had more than one barge of ammonia on site, we believe there could be situations warranting two. The largest ammonia barge contains 5 million pounds. \n\nThe plant also utilizes chlorine gas to treat the plant process and domestic water systems.  All of the chlorine used in this operation is received into the plant in one-ton capacity cylinders and in 150 lb capacity bottles.  The one-ton cylinders contain a maximum net weight of 1350 lbs.  There is no more than one 1350 lb. cylinder at each of the two water treating systems.  The chlorine inventories are therefore under the threshold quantity for inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nAscend Performance Materials has the following six commitments, expressing our intention to operate responsibly:\n\n- We will ensure that our operations and distribution systems are safe for employees, visitors, site contractors, communities and the environment.\n- We will make products that are safe when used responsibly.\n- We will keep our operations open to our communities and foster open communications with all of our stakeholders.\n- We will continuously improve our raw material and energy utilization efficiencies, to reduce our impact on the environment and improve the sustainability of our businesses.\n- We will encourage active participation in and positive contributions to safety, health and environmental stewardship by our employees.\n- We will search worldwide for new technologies that bring environmental, safety and health value to all of our stakeholders.\n\nA commitment to safety is involved in everything we do at the Pensacola Sit"

Our goal is simple -to create an incident-free workplace for employees, contractors, guests and the surrounding community.\n\nWe believe in preventing accidents before they occur. Toward that end, employees are thoroughly trained for their work. In addition, our manufacturing processes use state-of-the-art equipment, designed with the latest safety features.\n\nThe Pensacola plant has earned recognition for its commitment to safety as the first manufacturer in Florida to earn Star designation in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\nAscend endorses and supports the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care program --an international initiative that has helped chemical makers achieve one of the best safety performances of any industry in North America.\n\nAscend, Pensacola has clear written policies regarding employee involvement in all aspects of Safety.  Both the Safety Program Management policy Section IV - 1.07 and the Process Safety Management Employee Participation policy Section IV - 1.13 describe this involvement.\n\nThe plant's written ES&H procedures and standards are incorporated into two manuals.  The first manual contains 87 plant wide procedures that are revised at least every five years.  The second manual contains area-specific procedures (over 125 in number) that are reviewed and revised on a three-year cycle.  So, on average, sixty procedures are reviewed and updated each year.  The Safety Dept. manages the ES&H Manual revision program.  \n\nManagement demonstrates its leadership through attendance at safety meetings, participation in Focus Walk-thrus, area housekeeping inspections, and compliance training.  Communication is the key to the success of management commitment.  The site manager utilizes a variety of media (e.g., site wide TV monitors, attendance at various meetings) to convey his personal commitment that comp"

These include PSM and non-PSM audits, ISO audits, Corporate and insurance surveys and audits, environmental and industrial hygiene audits, and Management of Change audits.  We conduct safety reviews on new processes or process modifications at a number of stages of the project design and installation.  Pre-startup inspections are done before the process is commissioned.\n\nThe Pensacola plant is very dedicated to emergency response preparation in the event of any major incident.  The plant has 60 firefighters across all 4 shifts, giving 24/7 coverage.  These firefighters train 96 hours annually at the site on events such as flammable liquid fires, interior and exterior fire fighting, hazardous communications, and incident command.  The firefighters also train at the Texas A&M fire training school.  The plant fire department has one Class A pumper with foam capabilities to supplement the six fire pumps that take water from a 2 million gallon supply reservoir.\n\nCurrently, the plant has 16 EMTs training 48 hours annually on trauma assessment, burn care, and other medical topics.  The plant also has a fully stocked ambulance for transportation to the plant medical clinic.\n\nAll firefighters are trained as Hazardous Materials technicians, to respond to on-site  chemical emergencies.  These individuals are trained to handle both railcar and tanker truck emergencies.  \n\nThe site maintains 155 separate sprinkler systems, 68 monitor nozzles, 96 hydrants, hundreds of fire extinguishers, and other protection equipment.  The plantwide alarm system consists of 300 manual pull stations and 100 supervisory alarm systems.  In addition to the plantwide alarm system, individual operator radios are used to communicate an emergency.\n\nAscend is a member of the Local Emergency Planning"

Ascend also has a good working relationship with other nearby industrial facilities and with the local community fire departments.\n\nThe Pensacola site falls under compliance of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, which was implemented as a result of 9/11.  Ascend has worked with the U.S. Coast Guard, who has responsibility for the Security Act, to develop a new facility security plan which improves the security of our personnel, chemicals, and operations.  Implementation of the plan has included installation of new security cameras and motion detection devices around our ammonia and butane storage facilities.  \n\n\nFive Year Accident History: \n\nWe have had one accidental release of ammonia in the past five years.  A small quantity of ammonia was released in February 2006, which resulted in a minor injury to a contractor on site.  There were no offsite consequences from the release.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n- Process safety information\n- Process hazard analysis\n- Operating procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical integrity program\n- Management of change process\n- Pre-startup reviews\n- Compliance audits\n- Incident investigations\n- Employee participation\n- Hot work permit\n- Contractor management\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nAmmonia\n- The ammonia storage tank is a state-of-the-art installation.  Material is stored as a cryogenic liquid, which is the safest way to store.  The tank is essentially a tank within a tank, surrounded by a tall concrete dike with a vented roof.\n- Sensors are located throughout the ammonia area, which would alarm in the control rooms if a leak were t"
