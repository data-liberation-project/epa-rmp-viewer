The facility is located at 481 County Road 9, Schuyler, Nebraska 68661.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 28,800 pounds of ammonia for freezers and cold storage.  The majority of the system including vessels and compressors is located in the machine room.  The condensers are mounted on the machine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective freezer/cold storage areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Nor-Am Cold Storage facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in 2004 in accordance with the appropriate building and fire codes.\n\nThe Nor-Am Cold Storage ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.    For example, the Nor-Am Col"

In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems is used at the facility.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental ammonia releases at the Nor-Am facility since system startup in early  2004.  There have been no injuries due to ammonia system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nNor-Am Cold Storage has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nNor-Am Cold Storage maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE S"
