      "SummaryText": "Standard Hemp recently purchased an existing Cold Storage facility to dry and process Hemp. The facility has 2 separate buildings with 2 separate closed loop refrigeration systems. One is over 10,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia refrigerant and one is below 10,000 lbs. Both are operated as Program 3 facilities. With the reduced refrigeration load for Hemp its possible to connect to the two systems and remove the smaller separate mechanical room. This is being evaluated. The Risk Management Program at Standard Hemp complies with US EPA and Cal ARP requirements. \n\n\n\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations are outlined by the following major steps:\n\n1.    Identify Covered Processes\n\n2.    Determine Program Level\n\n3.    Establish a Management System\n\n4.    Conduct a 5-year Accident History\n\n5.    Perform Hazard Assessments\n\n6.    Develop an Accident Prevention Program\n\n7.    Develop an Emergency Response Program and\n\n8.    Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\n\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Standard Hemp are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training demonstrates this commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around processing and storage of tree fruit.  This activity is consistent with SIC 0723/ NAICS 115114 post harvest crop activities. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to use as a refrigerant. Ammonia (anhydrous) "

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \"dialogue\". According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  To perform the required offsite consequence analyses for other substances we have used.  Details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rulemaking.\n\n\n\nAlternate case scenario has also been evaluated and included. \n\n\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Mechanical Code. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nStandard Hemp maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our pr"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner and less than 2.5 years unless coordinated with the UPA.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Standard Hemp maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nStandard Hemp has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nStandard Hemp carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel or Refrigeration Contractors with a strong background in maintenance practices.  Specialized training is provided to these personnel as needed.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nStandard Hemp conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nStandard Hemp promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. Any incidents that release a reportable amount of Ammonia require updating the 5 year Accident History and filing a revised RMP with the EPA.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nStandard Hemp truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\n \n\nHot Work Permit\n\nAt Standard Hemp Hot Work Permit procedures are in place and enforced.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Standard Hemp has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\n\nStandard Hemp has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period at our previous Cold Storage facility. Any re-portable release requires updating the Accident History within 6 months.\n\n\n\n6.    Emergency Action Plan\n\nStandard Hemp has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes steps for evaluation, health and safety, mitigation without entering a hazardous area, notification if emergency response is required, appropriate Clean-up and reporting. Any changes in Emergency Contact information is reported within 30 days.\n\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. More frequent replacement of Safety Relief Valves, daily written logs of mechanical room inspections, updating emergency ventilation and possibly connecting the smaller cold storage to the Main plant and removing the smaller separate refrigeration system.    These and other changes recommended at the last PHA re-validation should be implemented by 7/1/2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
