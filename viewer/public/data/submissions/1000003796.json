The Facility Policy\n\n    The owners, management and employees of Hyman Farm Service, LLC are committed to the  prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be approximately 43,775 pounds in our 10,000-gallon storage tank.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the  43,775 pounds is rounded to 44,000.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n        a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 43775 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. Due to the rounding requirements fo the RMP Submit Program the 43775 pounds is rounded to 44000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of despersion to 200 ppm) is 1.4 miles.\n        b. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia"

The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
