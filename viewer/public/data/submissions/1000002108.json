The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nThe Linde Gas North America, LLC facility located in Hammond, Indiana complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane or acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Hammond Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  In addition, each employee is trained monthly on safety policies and procedures.  Employees also participate in Quarterly Safety Committee meetings for the facility.  Hazards identified during the meetings are corrected accordingly.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe Linde Gas facility manufactures and stores acetylene.  Acetylene is put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a medium pressure acetylene generator and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  The acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  \n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe Linde Gas facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The propane and acetylene systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA and state law at the Linde Gas facility in Hammond, Indiana.  All leaks are immediately reported to supervision.  Prompt clean-up of accidental releases and investigation into root causes are conducted to make corrections and to prevent future occurances.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\nThe Linde facility"
