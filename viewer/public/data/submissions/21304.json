Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Farmers Union Oil Company in Tolna are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Tolna Fire Department, which provides\nadditional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include liquid fertilizer manufacturing.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank at our facility in Tolna (Figure 1). The maximum amount\nstored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85 %.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the  \nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum distance\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population within a 5.2 -mile\nradius of this facility is 600.\n\nThe alternat"
