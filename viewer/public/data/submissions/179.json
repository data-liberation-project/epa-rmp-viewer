THE FACILITY POLICY.   \n\nTHE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF WEST CON ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES,TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. \n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION.\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZER FOR SALE TO FARMERS.   ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n     \nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA  STORED WOULD BE  180,000 POUNDS IN OUR 18,OOO GALLON AND 17,500 GALLON STORAGE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 79,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.94 MILES.\n\nB.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.78 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n     THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910."

THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME."
