              "Description": "Amines Plant No. 1 - U.S. Amines:\n\nU.S. Amines owns and operates two multi-purpose amine plants on site.  The plants are called:\n\n1.  Amines Plant No. 1\n2.  Amines Plant No. 2\n\nRMP specific to Cyclohexylamine:\n\nThese units include one common RMP listed chemical above the RMP threshold, cyclohexylamine.  Cyclohexylamine can be produced by both plants, and can be stored in the following locations:\n\n1.  Amines Plant No.1 has daily production storage tanks in the unit.\n2.  Amines Plant No.2 has daily production storage tanks in the unit.\n3.  There are two storage tanks in our tank farm storage facility.  Both plants can use these tanks.\n4.  The site can also store cyclohexylamine in railcars, while they are awaiting shipment.\n\nOperations of these storage locations and production of cyclohexylamine fall under the site PSM program.  The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.\n\nRMP specific to Amines Plant No. 1:\n\nAmines Plant No. 1 also includes the following RMP listed chemicals above the RMP threshold:\n\n1.  Ammonia\n2.  Ethylamine\n3.  Isopropylamine\n\nAmmonia\n\nOperations of the storage locations for ammonia and the operations using ammonia fall under the site PSM program.  Ammonia is stored as a liquefied gas.  There are three storage tanks for pure ammonia which do not have storage containment dikes because diking would not contain the ammonia from evaporation.  Storage for ammonia within the process unit does include diking as the ammonia stored in the process is not pure and diking would contain some of the material that would not immediately evaporate.  \n\nEthylamine and Isopropylamine\n\nOperations of the storage locations and production of ethylamine and isopropylamine fall under the site PSM program.  The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.\n\nRMP elements common to the site:\n\nThe plants are subject to and operated in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  The site maintains one PSM plan which includes application of the OSHA PSM rule.\n\nThe site has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM rule.  Some of those polices are listed below:\n1.  Sight glass use: Sight glass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service.  In cases where sight level indicators are needed, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n2.  Quarter-turn valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight handle valve open.\n3.  Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process in order to provide more consistent evaluation of risk.  This provides better guidance in reducing risk, over the HAZOP only type of analysis.\n4.  The plant belongs to and participates in a local emergency response group (LEPC) and a local community advisory panel (LCAP).\n5.  All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform.\n6.  All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n7.  A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory issues.\n8.  All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n9.  The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability and water reservoir.\n10.  The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response and decontamination materials.\n11.  The plant alarm system is tested weekly.\n12.  Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.",

              "Description": "Amines Plant No. 2 - U. S. Amines:\n\nU. S. Amines owns and operates two multi-purpose amine plants on site.  The plants are called:\n\n1.  Amines Plant No. 1\n2.  Amines Plant No. 2\n\nRMP specific to Cyclohexylamine:\n\nThese units include one common RMP listed chemical above the RMP threshold, cyclohexylamine.  Cyclohexylamine can be produced by both plants, and can be stored in the following locations:\n\n1.  Amines Plant No.1 has daily production storage tanks in the unit.\n2.  Amines Plant No.2 has daily production storage tanks in the unit.\n3.  There are two storage tanks in our tank farm storage facility.  Both plants can use these tanks.\n4.  The site can also store cyclohexylamine in railcars, while they are awaiting shipment.\n\nOperations of these storage locations and production of cyclohexylamine fall under the site PSM program.  The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.\n\nRMP specific to Amines Plant No. 2:\n\nAmines Plant No. 2 also includes the following RMP listed chemical above the RMP threshold:\n\n1.  Propionitrile\n\nOperations of the storage locations and production operations using propionitrile fall under the site PSM program.  The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.\n\nSpecial personal protective equipment is used with propionitrile to prevent absorption of liquid or vapors into the skin.  The vapor space of the storage tank is purged with nitrogen to prevent formation of an explosive atmosphere condition.\n\nRMP elements common to the site:\n\nThe plants are subject to and operated in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  The site maintains one PSM plan which includes application of the OSHA PSM rule.\n\nThe site has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM rule.  Some of those polices are listed below:\n1.  Sight glass use: Sight glass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service.  In cases where sight level indicators are needed, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n2.  Quarter-turn valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight handle valve open.\n3.  Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process in order to provide more consistent evaluation of risk.  This provides better guidance in reducing risk, over the HAZOP only type of analysis.\n4.  The plant belongs to and participates in a local emergency response group (LEPC) and a local community advisory panel (LCAP).\n5.  All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform.\n6.  All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n7.  A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory issues.\n8.  All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n9.  The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability and water reservoir.\n10.  The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response and decontamination materials.\n11.  The plant alarm system is tested weekly.\n12.  Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.",

Like our community neighbors, the people who work at the Bucks site want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why US Amines has a \"zero incident\" goal.  We are committed to reducing emissions and continuously improving our performance toward zero injuries and zero environmental incidents.\n\nThe amines plant began operations in 1974.  We manufacture amines in five product groups.  We also operate an on-site fertilizer plant owned by IB Nitrogen that is not covered by RMP.  We have about 45 site employees and 15 resident contractors.\n\nThe US Amines product groups are:\n     Isopropylamines\n     Propylamines\n     Cyclohexylamines\n     Ethylamines\n     Butylamines\nThese products are used by other chemical companies to make herbicides, insecticides, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe IB Nitrogen product is:\n     Isobutylidene diurea\nThis product is a slow-release specialty fertilizer used on golf courses and turf farms.  It is also used in plant nurseries for growing ornamentals such as azaleas and poinsettias.\n\nThe US Amines Bucks Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in our operations.  The LeMoyne Community Advisory Panel and the LeMoyne Industrial Park companies are recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding cooperation.  This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\n\nPlant Organization:\n\nThe plant has a site director (plant manager) who oversees all plant activities.

They are trained in the specifics of incident command, emergency response, and medical response.  The plant conducts weekly tests of the plant alarm system and conducts emergency response drills.\n\nThe US Amines Bucks plant complies with RMP and OSHA 1910.119, (the OSHA Process Safety Regulation) through our Process Safety Management Program.  The Bucks plant manages all plant processes per our Process Safety Management program.  The program meets all of the RMP and OSHA requirements such as:\n*  Develop and implement a risk management system.\n*  Conduct hazard assessments of all processes.\n*  Implement accident prevention requirements.\n*  Develop an emergency response program that is coordinated with\n    local agencies.\n*  Track and analyze incidents to prevent reoccurrence.\n\nThe RMP regulation has an additional requirement to develop worst case and alternate case scenarios and make them available to the public.  A summary of these studies is presented below:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\nThe Worst Case Scenarios are meant to represent the worst possible incident. There has never been a Worst Case Scenario type event in the 30-year history of the Bucks plant.
