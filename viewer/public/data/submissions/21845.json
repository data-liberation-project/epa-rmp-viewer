The Honeywell Danville Plant endeavors to accomplish this by participating on and cooperating closely with the Vermilion County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n \n\n2. Plant Description\n\nThe Honeywell Danville Plant is located at 209 Brewer Road in Danville, IL, county of Vermilion. The area is bounded on the north by woods, on the east by a railroad switching yard, on the south by farmland and on the east by several residences. The plant employs 21 workers.\n\nThe Honeywell Danville Plant's one covered process is comprised of storage tanks and bulk loading and unloading facilities for difluoroethane (HFC 152a) and methyl ether (also known as dimethyl ether). \n\nBoth HFC 152a and methyl ether are used as propellants for various personal care products, primarily hair spray in cans.\n\n \n3.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  \n\nIt is the policy of the Honeywell Danville Plant to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by\n\n\u00b7 identifying and controlling health, safety, or environmental risks related to its operations; \n\u00b7 designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; \n\u00b7 conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and \n\u00b7 establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of difluoroethane and methyl ether involves: \n\n\u00b7 the integration of safety programs, devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, \n\u00b7 safe operational procedures and management practices, \n\u00b7 operator training, \n\u00b7 the preparation and testing of plant emergency response plans, \n\u00b7 the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment, and \n\u00b7 a trained Emergen"

Both management systems are integrated with all other plant management systems.  These systems contain documented procedures for safe work practices, management of change, maintenance of process safety information, work permitting, emergency response, environmental monitoring, pollution prevention and employee health monitoring.\n\nThe emergency response plan is a documented procedure that covers activation, response, notification, personnel protection, evacuation and incident critique.  The plant's emergency response personnel are regularly trained to maintain a high level of readiness and expertise. Emergency response drills  are held within the plant and we plan to hold them with local emergency response agencies.\n\n4.  Worst Case and alternative release scenarios and administrative and mitigation controls in place to limit the impact of a release\n \nEPA's Risk Management Program requires the Honeywell Danville plant to prepare an analysis of a hypothetical worst case release of the chemicals covered by the RMP regulation.  EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure.  EPA also assumes that the failure takes place instantaneously and that all safety systems fail to operate.  In addition, the release must take place during infrequent weather conditions that would inhibit dispersion of any vapor cloud.  For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.  In addition, the Honeywell Danville plant is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario for the chemicals covered by the RMP regulations.\n\nThe offsite consequence anal"

The offsite consequences for each identified scenario were modeled pursuant to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  \n\nThe worst case scenario for flammable chemicals was identified as a release of methyl ether from a rail car.  The contents of one car, 110,000 pounds, were assumed to be released instantaneously to the atmosphere followed by a vapor cloud explosion. There would be an offsite impact from this release.\n\nBecause of the safety systems and prevention programs in place, the plant focussed emergency planning resources on release scenarios that, although unlikely, represent some potential for occurrence.  The facility evaluated process hazard analyses conducted on the regulated processes and reviewed incident histories to identify potential release scenarios.  The worst case alternative release scenario is described below:\n\nMethyl ether (Dimethyl ether)\n\nA review of the methyl ether handling system was conducted to identify an alternative release scenario.  Methyl ether is transferred to tank trucks through 20 feet sections of 2- inch diameter hose connected to transfer piping with Camlock style connectors. The failure of a hose connector was chosen for planning purposes. \n\nIt was estimated that should this situation occur, the incident would be discovered and the transfer activity ceased within 10 minutes.  The plant emergency brigade could respond and direct water to mitigate the vapors shortly thereafter.\n\nIt is estimated that about 1,480 pounds of methyl ether would be released. The AEROPLUME Module of the HGSYSTEMS Model indicates that such a release would not result in an offsite impact. \n\n5.
