ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nIn response to the federal Environmental Protection Agency requirement, and as stipulated in Section 68 of Title 40 in the Code of Federal Regulation, and the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule under the Clean Air Act, Section 112?; this Risk Management Plan (RMP),  has been developed for the Nunes Cooling, Inc., Cantua Creek, CA   produce cooling and shipping facility.  The purpose of this RMP is to:\n* Increase the protection of public health and the environment by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling an acutely hazardous material (AHM).\n* Assist Nunes Cooling Inc. and the local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling an AHM.\nThis document addresses the AHM system for the produce refrigeration process at the Nunes Cooling, Inc. facility.  The AHM to be used at the facility and for the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia.  The devices that use and store this AHM will be the subjects of investigation throughout this RMP document.\n\nNUNES COOLING INC.  Is located within Fresno County, California, in an entirely agricultural area, and is a produce pre-cooling, cold storage, and shipping facility.   The facility was first constructed on this site in the year 2000.   Anhydrous ammonia is used as the closed loop system refrigerant for the pre-cooling and cold storage equipment and is the only acutely hazardous chemical used on the site in reportable quantities .   The facility consists of approximately 52,000 sq ft of cold storage warehouse space and various types of fixed and mobile pre-cooling equipment on the approximate 23 acre site.\nThe risks to the community from this facility would come from an incident in which the ammonia normally contained within the refrigeration system was allowed to escape into the atmosphere.

      "SummaryText": "ence Analysis contained herein incorporates the worst-case scenario and an alternate release scenarios.   Events which were considered possible and able to cause a release of ammonia for the purposes of the Hazard Evaluation were: equipment failure, operator error, design deficiency, vehicular accident, acts of sabotage/vandalism, fire and earthquake.   It is expected that other specific events would have similar results as those listed above.\n          Mitigation of ammonia releases is addressed by the following:\n               1.   System design and construction\n               2.   Administrative controls\n               3.   Containment curb inside the main engine room\n               4.   Diffusion tank for PRV releases\n               5.   Operating engineer on-site daily\n               6.   Off-hours security service\n               7.   A release inside of a building could involve closing the building doors\n       Administrative controls and policies to be used in the event of a release are contained in the existing \" Business Response  \n       Plan - 2004\".   The major topics covered by this document are:\n               1.   Emergency Contact List\n               2.   Emergency Action Team\n               3.   Notification Procedures\n               4.

Employee Training\n               9.   Employer Emergency Response Checklist\n       Risk reduction steps have been and are continuing to be implemented by Nunes Cooling Inc. to .minimize the possibility of\n       an accidental release of ammonia,  and in the event of an accidental release, to minimize the effects upon the surrounding \n       properties.   The essential risk reduction steps now in effect at this facility are:\n               1.   Regular daily equipment inspections\n               2.   The weekly equipment insp"
