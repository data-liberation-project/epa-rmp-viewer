Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 14 states.  Twenty processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest U.S. grain companies.  Perdue also manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\nThe Perdue Farms DeFuniak Springs facility is a poultry processing plant located approximately two miles east of the city of DeFuniak Springs, Florida.  This facility employs approximately 400 associates and  normally operates 24 hours a day, six days a week.  The refrigeration department, however, works 24 hours per day, seven days per week.\n\nThe regulated substance at the DeFuniak Springs facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as an integral part of its refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system, comprising several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping, and air handling units located throughout the processing plant, is used to maintain proper food safety temperatures.  The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is 27,000 pounds, distributed throughout the refrigeration components.\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe working conditions and safe pr"

Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans at each operations facility as part of an overall chemical management program.  The program involves a wide range of senior management personnel, including the Director of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to its staff.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe Perdue Farms DeFuniak Springs facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components.  As part of the program, trained maintenance personnel inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance, as needed.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe mechanical room and the towers that support the condensers are located approximately 40 feet from a railroad line.  The worst-case scenario for the refrigeration system involves a train derailment and collision of one or more railcars with the mechanical room equipment and condenser towers.  Such a collision could result in release of all the ammonia, approximately 27,000 pounds, contained in the system.  Using the RMP*Comp Ver 1.06 modeling software, the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.9 miles, affecting schools, residences, hospitals, prisons/correction facilities, recreation areas, major commercial, office or industrial areas, libr"

The estimated population within the 2.9-mile radius is 3,800, based on U.S. Census Bureau information contained in LANDVIEW III mapping software.\n\nAlternative release scenarios:\n\nSeveral alternative release scenarios were considered.  The alternative release scenario selected for further evaluation involves the release of anhydrous ammonia from an open pipe flange connection on a high pressure liquid line on the roof.  It was estimated that this type of accident would result in a release of 1,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in 15 minutes.  Using the DEGADIS dispersion model, the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles, affecting residences only.  The estimated population within the 0.2-mile radius is 11, based on U.S. Census Bureau information contained LANDVIEW III mapping software.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving ammonia at the Perdue DeFuniak Springs facility that have resulted in death, injuries, property damage, evacuations, environmental damage or sheltering in place.  \n\nEmergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the refrigeration system, the facility has a well defined incident command system.  The written Emergency Response Plan includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release, and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials.  Perdue continues to train its associates on hazardous responses and awareness, and conducts mock drills routinely.  The facility has discussed its response program with local LEPC and fire department representatives.\n\nAs part of its Risk Management Program, Perdue Farms has developed an RMP Communications Plan.  The goals of this plan are (1) to educate the public on the potential risk of regulated substances used by Perdue; (2) to respond to any concerns that RMP disclosures may cause with honest, fact-based communications; and (3) to be fully prepared to effectively respond to a"

In addition, training and information materials for the Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civic groups, the media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nAs part of Perdue's continual improvement philosophy, all Perdue facilities continue to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety."
