      "SummaryText": "Redfield Energy, LLC  (Redfield) is an ethanol fuel production plant located in Redfield, in Spink County, South Dakota.  The facility began operations on April 26, 2007.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Redfield has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that exceed reporting thresholds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRedfield is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. Redfield uses natural gasoline as a denaturant to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  Redfield uses anhydrous ammonia is for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  It is the policy of Redfield to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Redfield to notify the City of Redfield Police & Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process co-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of natural gasoline, or denaturant, which may contain approximately 25 percent n-pentane, 28 percent isopentane, and 3 percent n-butane, all RMP regulated substances. The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is approximately 550,000 pounds (total n-pentane approximately 140,000 pounds, isopentane 150,000 lbs, and n-butane 17,000 lbs).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored o"

Redfield has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to the reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented. Redfield has coordinated emergency response with local authorities and responding agencies and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Redfield has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP and Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRedfield Energy, LLC does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years."
