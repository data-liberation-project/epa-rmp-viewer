The Prevention Elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) System prepared in compliance with CFR 1910.119\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and State requirements.  The chlorination process at the Mercedita Pumping Station uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, PROSHO and EQB.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Mercedita Pumping Station observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine. The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Mecedita Pumping Station and the inmidiate surounding areas. Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release as well as a written emergency program for respose to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Mercedita Pumping Station pretreats the raw wastewater prior to pump it to the watewater treatment plant. Chlorine is used to treat the water in order to eliminate objectionable odors.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in one tons container. The maximum inventory of Chlorine is 6,000 pounds. \n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program is composed of many elements and its objective is to prevent accidents and protec the human health, the environment and the property.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPRASA has an emergency response program.  Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area fo"

The emergency response program is coordinated with Emergency Management Agency for notification of the public. \n\nPRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training. All PRASA facilities are scheduled to receive refresher training .\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years, there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPRASA uses Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety.  Issues identified from at PHA are then addressed in PRASA Prevention Program. Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent trainings in operating procedures and emergency response, and an improved maintenance program."
