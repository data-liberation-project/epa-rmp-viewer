The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nDreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nDreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department/HazMat team.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Dreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The Dreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  Chief Engineer  will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to the Low Pressure Receivers (2), where the pressure and temperature of ammonia is reduced.  The resulting low pressure ammonia liquid flows to the evaporators to provide cooling capabilities for the cold or frozen storage rooms. \n\nAs the air is cooled around the evaporator, the heat removed from the air vaporizes the ammonia liquid inside the coils or tubes.  The ammonia is returned to the low pre"

Vapor from the Low Pressure Receiver # 1 (-30 ?F) is sent to the booster compressors.  The vapor is compressed from low pressure ammonia vapor to an intermediate pressure vapor.  The booster compressor discharge is sent through the Low Pressure Receiver # 2 ( +15 ?F) to reduce the temperature before being sent to the high stage compressors.  \n\nThe high stage compressors then take the vapor discharge from the Low Pressure Receiver # 2 and generate a high pressure vapor.  The high stage discharge is transferred to the condensers where it changes phase and becomes a high pressure liquid and is returned back to the High Pressure Receiver where the cycle can begin again.  Discharge from the high stage compressors is also used as hot gas  defrost of the evaporators.  \n\nAll refrigeration equipment was installed per American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the process flow lines handling ammonia were designed according to American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, and are of steel construction.  The ammonia vessels were designed and constructed in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code.  The original equipment was put into operation in 1960, with a major expansion in 1969.  The majority of the ammonia equipment is inside the engine room where flammable materials are not stored.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the facility is 11,000 pounds.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n      Scenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel - 11,000 pounds in 10 minutes.

The enclosure of the building was considered a passive mitigation which impacts the release rate to the outside atmosphere.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.

The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 134 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  Reference tables in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Dreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Dreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  facility operates in accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nIn addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is centrally located (inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to protect the integrity of all the vessels.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through v"

Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nCurrently, the facility has ammonia sensors in the cold storage rooms and engine room.  The detectors are connected to the Andover computer system.  The two engine room detectors have two setpoints which are set to page the maintenance operators at the first level and shutdown the system at the second setpoint.  The ammonia detectors in the cold storage rooms  have a single set point to alarm through the Andover computer system and page a maintenance operator.  \n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. \n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility?s accident history during the period between the initial HAZOP (October 19, 1995) and the PHA Revalidation (December 17, 2001) was reviewed and found no accidents or near misses at the facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the facility?s RMP document.  As a company policy, Dreisbach employees do not respond offensively to ammonia emergencies.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Contra Costa County Fire Department and the City of Richmond.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the Contra Costa County Hazardous Materials Response Team.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center is called.\n\nThe Dreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  facility has an Incident Command System in place.
