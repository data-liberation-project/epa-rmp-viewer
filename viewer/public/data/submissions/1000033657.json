ANPI (formerly the Apache Powder Company) has been manufacturing at its Cochise County facility since 1922. ANPI established a mission to be best in its class and recognizes that attaining that commitment means operating and maintaining its manufacturing process in a safe and responsible manner. To prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances, ANPI has developed and is implementing a comprehensive Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. ANPI understands the risks associated with releases of hazardous substances and ensures that those risks are being well managed at its facility.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure the safety of its employees and the public as well as to protect the environment, ANPI's RMP is a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning programs. ANPI has already begun implementation of this program. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities ANPI has developed and is implementing.\r\n\r\n2.0 SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nANPI manufactures nitrogen-based chemical products for the mining and agricultural industries. In simplest terms, ANPI converts anhydrous ammonia into various ammonium nitrate products. There is one manufacturing process at the ANPI facility consisting of six interconnected production units: 1) Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area, 2) Nitric Acid Plant AOP3, 3) Nitric Acid Plant AOP4, 4) Liquid Ammonium Nitrate (LAN) Plant, 5) Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant, and 6) Liquid Fertilizer Plant. ANPI has two support (i.e., non-production) units that are located apart from the manufacturing process: 7) Brine Concentrator and 8) Powerhouse. For the purposes of this Risk Management Plan, the Brine Concentrator and Powerhouse units are not part of the RMP covered"

MOC procedures ensure that specific listed items are addressed prior to any change. Also, ANPI employees and/or contract employees affected by the change are informed of, and trained in, the change before start-up. If a change results in a change to the PSI or the OPs, these PSM elements are updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n11. Incident Investigation - ANPI investigates each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, an accidental release of a hazardous substance (ANPI Document No. PSM-0011). An ANPI investigation team immediately initiates an incident investigation. The ANPI investigation team prepares an incident report and develops a system to address and resolve report findings and recommendations. In addition, the incident investigation report is reviewed with all affected ANPI personnel and the report is retained for five years.\r\n\r\n12. Compliance Audit - At least every three years, ANPI evaluates compliance with the provisions of the PSM (ANPI Document No. PSM-0013). ANPI specifies the requirements for the audit team and the report. Response or corrective actions to compliance audit findings are implemented and documented.\r\n\r\n4.2 Response Actions in the Event of a Release\r\n\r\nIn the event of accidental release of a hazardous substance that could have offsite consequences, ANPI response actions would include any or all of the following: employing mitigation measures, implementing the ER Plan, notifying the community, performing shelter-in-place, or evacuating the affected area(s).\r\n\r\n4.2.1 Mitigation\r\n\r\nMitigation prevents or minimizes an accidental hazardous substance release.

Mechanical integrity training is provided to ANPI maintenance employees.\r\n\r\nThe schedule of inspection and testing is consistent with manufacturers' recommendations and good engineering practices. Daily walk-through inspections are performed for each production and support unit at the ANPI facility. Inspections are conducted to find any unusual or increasing vibration, leaks, stress corrosion cracking, or other indications of potential failures. Scheduled replacement and preventive inspection and maintenance for pressure relief valves are performed. Scheduled inspection and calibration of liquid level, temperature, and pressure instruments, switches, and shutdown devices that have safety implications are performed. Scheduled inspections of major powered equipment such as compressors, pumps, large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, and mountings are performed.\r\n\r\nAlso, process equipment is inspected and tested according to generally accepted good engineering practices and each inspection and test is documented. Any deficiencies in equipment that are outside acceptable limits are corrected in a timely manner. In addition, construction of new equipment is evaluated to ensure proper assembly and installation. Finally, maintenance materials and spare parts must be suitable for ANPI's manufacturing process.\r\n\r\n9. Hot Work Permits - ANPI has established and implements a process that issues a hot work permit (i.e., safety checklist) for all hot work operations performed on or near a manufacturing process (ANPI Document No. PSM-0009). Hot work operations include welding, cutting, brazing, burning, grinding; using non-intrinsically safe electrical tools and instruments; working on electrical circuits; or using flame or spark producing devices.

Different safeguards apply to different units in the covered process, except for the Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area and Liquid Fertilizer Plant which share safeguards.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the ANPI facility in an amount equal to or greater than the threshold quantity, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68. Anhydrous ammonia is imported to the ANPI facility by railcar. The railcars are unloaded into the Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area. Ammonia then enters into ANPI's Nitric Acid Plants (AOP3 and AOP4). The resulting acid feeds into the LAN Plant where it is reacted with more ammonia to produce LAN. The majority of the LAN is then pumped to the Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant where it is concentrated and converted from liquid to solid form. The remaining LAN is either sold directly to customers or converted into fertilizer solutions at the Liquid Fertilizer Plant. At the Liquid Fertilizer Plant, LAN is used to produce several liquid fertilizers to serve the seasonal needs of the agricultural industry.\r\n\r\n3.0 SUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS\r\n\r\nThe potential hazards associated with ANPI's manufacturing process are related to chemical releases, equipment failures, and process upsets. The nature of the hazard is related to the type of event or accident that could occur.\r\n\r\nRelevant onsite or facility hazards associated with the production and support units are reported in this document on a unit-by-unit basis.

ANPI's risk to offsite receptors near the ANPI facility. At the ANPI facility, the frequency and severity of a hazardous substance release is reduced through the implementation of effective prevention, management, mitigation, and emergency response (ER) measures.\r\n\r\n4.1 Prevention Program Management System\r\n\r\nANPI's RMP reduces the likelihood of a hazardous substance release by implementing a prevention program. An organizational chart illustrating ANPI's prevention program management system is provided.\r\n\r\nANPI's prevention program elements are the same as the requirements for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). ANPI has qualified employees trained in PSM and has established an organization to assure proper implementation of PSM within the RMP.\r\n\r\nANPI implements a set of twelve management areas designed to protect worker health and safety in the event of accidental releases. To address the hazards of a potential hazardous substance release, the following PSM steps are taken at the ANPI facility:\r\n\r\n1. Employee Participation - ANPI consults with its employees on the development of process hazard analysis (PHA) and the development of the other elements of PSM. In addition, ANPI employees are provided access to all PSM information. ANPI has also prepared a written plan of action that describes how employee participation is imple"

Process Safety Information (PSI) - ANPI has established and implements a written program that addresses and controls written PSI on each production and support unit in the manufacturing process (ANPI Document No. PSM-0002). PSI was compiled with respect to the hazard of the chemicals used in the process, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process. ANPI implements good engineering practices for the design, maintenance, inspection, testing, and operation of process equipment.\r\n\r\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - ANPI has established and implements a written program to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards for each production and support unit in the manufacturing process (ANPI Document No. PSM-0003). ANPI has performed eight PHAs. ANPI established the priority order and schedule for conducting the PHA, addressed the items to evaluate in the analyses, decided the make-up of the PHA team, and determined a system to resolve PHA findings and recommendations. ANPI retains the PHA record for the life of the manufacturing process.\r\n\r\n4. Operating Procedures (OPs) - ANPI has developed and implements a written program that addresses and controls written OPs process (ANPI Document No. PSM-0004). OPs are consistent with the PSI for each production and support unit in the manufacturing process. OPs address the steps for each operating phase of the manufacturing process, the operating limits, certain safety and health considerations related to the process, and safety systems and their functions. OPs are readily accessible to ANPI employees, reviewed periodically for accuracy, and reviewed on an annual basis. ANPI has developed and implements safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the manufacturing area.\r\n\r\n5.

Contractors - As part of its selection process, ANPI evaluates the safety performance and programs of ANPI contract employees in accordance with ANPI Document No. PSM-0006. ANPI informs contractors of process hazards and applicable parts of ANPI's Emergency Response Program (ERP). ANPI has developed and implements safe work practices to control contractor access to the manufacturing process areas. ANPI conducts periodic walk-through inspections to evaluate the safety performance of contractors. ANPI's policy is to hire qualified contractors who are trained to safely perform their jobs and who are knowledgeable in the hazards related to their jobs. The contractor's training is verified by ANPI. Safety rules are strictly enforced at the ANPI facility to ensure that contract employees follow safety rules. ANPI requires contractors to inform ANPI of any unique hazards presented by the contractor's work.\r\n\r\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) - When a modification requires a change in the PSI, ANPI performs a PSSR for new sources of hazardous substances (ANPI Document No. PSM-0007).
