This facility is also aware of it regulated status as set forth within 40 CFR 68 as a Program 2 facility with regard to\n\nChemical Accident Prevention requirements.\n\n\n\nThe owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\nTherefore, the facility has coordinated facility details and hazards associated with the process with the Local Emergency Planning Committee within\n\nSt. Martin Parish as well as the local fire department.\n\n\n\nThis facility is a potable water treatment plant. Treatment includes chlorination of water with two (2) one ton chlorine cylinders located at the facility\n\n(4,000 lbs total). The process basically involves continuous mixing of chlorine with water whereby the final mixture contains less than 1 % chlorine\n\nby weight. The storage cylinders and mixing equipment are subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements because they contain threshold quantities of regulated\n\nsubstances.\n\n\n\nThe facilities general accidental release prevention program is comprised of operator training, facility maintenance, procedural reviews, and routine\n\nequipment inspections. These programs are outlined within 40 CFR 68 Subpart C Program 2 Prevention Program. Additionally, the facility complies\n\nwith 40 CFR Subpart E Emergency Response regulations. Although the facility has elected to evacuate in the event of a release, the program\n\nestablishes notification procedures to alert the public and response resources.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required. A written program is in place as a stand alone document.\n\nEmployees of this facility are trained in emergency procedures. As"
