The same properties that make Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide valuable as water treatment chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling both materials.  The prevention of unnecessary human exposure reduces the threat to the health and safety of employees as well as to nearby members of the community.  The primary goal of this Risk Management Pan is to ensure the safety of the employees of this facility and all residents that may be impacted by a release from this facility.\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Camden to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, and the training of the personnel.\n\nThis Risk Management Program, including the Emergency Response Program, was developed with the assistance of ALTEC Environmental Consultants, Inc. and NRS Consulting Engineers, Inc.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the appropriate agencies and potentially affected members of the community.  In addition, it provides procedures for mitigating any releases that may cause harm to the community.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the wastewater by utilizing chemicals such as Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are received in individual one-ton cylinders and stored until needed.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are injected into the wastewater treatment system by automatic feeders.  The feed system uses a vacuum \u00bfshut-off\u00bf system, which is designed to automatically shut the system down if a leak occurs.\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at this facility are Chlorine and S"

The maximum amount of Sulfur Dioxide stored at the facility is 2,300 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of and total release from the largest storage tank when filled to capacity, resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of Chlorine.  Both Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide create a hazard when released.  They are both toxic materials, with the same distances to their endpoint based on EPA\u00bfs document entitled \u00bfBack Up Information For The Hazard Assessment in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\u00bf  However, as Chlorine is the more toxic of the two chemicals, a worst\u00bfcase scenario of Chlorine has been used.\n\nActive mitigation has been considered for this scenario.  The Chlorine storage tanks are located in the Chlorine Cylinder Room, which is constructed of concrete wall on two sides and two open sides.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a vapor. The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.9 miles.\n\nAn alternative scenario was determined for this facility.  However, the alternative release should be minimal due to the type of control system in place.  The vacuum \u00bfshut-off\u00bf system has been determined to be effective in preventing greater than small quantities of Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide from being released.  Estimations based on the line capacity for the feeder lines would be approximately 10 pounds released into the atmosphere under this scenario.   This quantity of Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide vapor released would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.1 of a mile.\n\nThis wastewater treatment facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State of Arkansas codes and regulations.\n\nThere have no accidental releases of Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide in the last five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program was developed for the City of Camden and the surrounding areas with th"
