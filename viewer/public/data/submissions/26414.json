      "SummaryText": "\nThe Nevamar Company, Fome-Cor facility in Glasgow, Kentucky is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the Fome-Cor plant has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a pentane and 1,1 difluoroethane (152A) Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68 and with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  The Fome-Cor facility has complied with the OSHA PSM standard since 1993.  \n\nPentane is stored on site in a 30,000 gallon tank.  152A is stored in a 5400 gallon tank.  \nPentane and 1,1 difluoroethane are mixed together to produce the foam.  The foam is then laminated with paper. This laminated foam is sold for use in the graphic arts industry and construction market.  \n\nIn order to minimize the potential for release, the facility has developed detailed procedures for handling pentane and 152 A.  The facility also proactively maintains the components of these systems by conducting nondestructive testing of the storage tanks and piping to ensure that any potential failures are detected before they occur.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is failure of the 30,000 gallon pentane storage tank when filled to 85% resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint with a 1 psi over pressure will have offsite impact.  This explosion would impact local industries.  It would not impact any residential areas.  \n\nThe most realistic release scenario would involve a release from a hole in a pipe due to physical damage.  If this leak occurred at the discharge of the 152A transfer pump, approximately 7200 pounds of 152A could be released over a two hour period.  If this vapor cloud exploded, it would have offsite impact.  Similar to the worst case scenario, only industri"

The facility has coordinated emergency response actions with the fire department.  Facility personnel will not provide emergency response.\n\nThe facility recently completed safety improvements that were identified during a process hazard review.  There are no further safety changes scheduled at this time."
