A 20% aqueous ammonia solution is utilized at the facility as required for producing ammoniated zinc. \r\n\r\n1.2.2 Facility Location\r\n\r\nButtonwillow Warehouse Company Tank Farm Mixer is located at 125 Front Street, Buttonwillow, CA 93206. The latitude and longitude of the tank farm mixer is 35.398346, -119.470706. The facility is located approximately 4 miles west of Interstate Highway 5, surrounded by the city of Buttonwillow to the north and agricultural land to the west, east, and south.\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\r\n\r\nButtonwillow Warehouse Company Tank Farm Mixer is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Buttonwillow Warehouse Company Tank Farm Mixer has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\r\n\r\nAt Buttonwillow Warehouse Company Tank Farm Mixer, the 20% aqueous ammonia solution is stored in a portable poly tank and pumped to the 2,500 gallon mixer where it is mixed with zinc powder and water to form ammoniated zinc. During the mixing process, the 20% aqueous ammonia solution is consumed by the chemical reactions which occur.\r\n\r\nProcess Chemistry\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia is utilized at the Warehouse Tank Mixer as a reactant in"

The Zinc(II)Hydroxide is not soluble in water and precipitates out of solution; making the solution thicken and turn white.\r\n\r\n2NH4(+) (aq) + Zn(OH)2 (s)\r\n\r\nWhen the above reaction is complete, more aqueous ammonia and water are added until the concentration of ammonia is quadruple that of the Zinc(II)Hydroxide. This excess ammonia shares electrons with the zinc that simultaneously fill the outermost, bonding electron shell of the zinc and the nitrogen. This breaks the bond between the Zn and the two hydroxyl groups; causing them to separate and form hydroxide ions, OH(-).\r\n\r\n4NH3 (aq) + Zn(OH)2 (s) &#8594; 4NH3(+) (aq) + Zn(2-) + 2OH(-)\r\n\r\nFinally, the ammonia molecules combine with the zinc and form a complex ion with a +2 charge overall. The charges within the complex ion, -2 on the Zn and +1 on each NH3 molecule, make the molecule polar, meaning that it has localized areas of both positive and negative charge, and since water is also polar, the ion is soluble and dissolves in solution.\r\n\r\n4NH3 (aq) + Zn(2+) &#8594; [Zn(NH3)4](2+) + 2OH(-)\r\n\r\nThe ammoniated zinc that is formed is the chemical intermediate that is utilized in fertilizer manufacturing, and the solution is filtered to remove impurities and then stored until use.\r\nSafety Systems\r\n\r\n2,500 Gallon Mixing Tank Control Panel\r\n\r\nThe 2,500 Gallon Mixing Tank has a control panel which starts and stops the pumps and conveyor associated with the tank.\r\n\r\nScale\r\n\r\nThe 2,500 Gallon Mixing Tan"

When a RMP-CalARP program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, BWC Tank Farm Mixer has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-CalARP program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, BWC Tank Farm Mixer now thinks of the RMP-CalARP program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for BWC Tank Farm Mixer employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-CalARP program BWC Tank Farm Mixer will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
