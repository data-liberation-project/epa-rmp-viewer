It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  The Plasti-Kote, Inc. Medina, Ohio facility has a detailed, practiced Emergency Response Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION:  The Plasti-Kote, Inc. Medina, Ohio facility manufactures architectural paint and coatings.  The majority of the paint and coatings manufactured at the plant are filled in pressurized spray cans.  The facility operates several storage tanks that contain a flammable mixture of propane, n-butane, isobutane, and/or methyl ether that is used as propellants for the aerosol cans.  In addition, the facility operates an on-site warehouse for storage of architectural and industrial aerosol coatings.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  The Medina, Ohio Facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, which is a systematic method of preventing accidental releases and complies with EPA's accident prevention rule.  As such, the facility has completed a detailed analysis on the process to ensure the safe use and operation of the applicable equipment.   Numerous safeguards are in place and include Operational Procedures, manual and automated control systems, safety interlocks, and other accepted good engineering and industry practices.

Medina, Ohio plant has never had an accident involving flammable propellants that resulted in injuries, property damage or environmental releases.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  In the event of an emergency involving flammable propellants, plant personnel will notify the Medina Fire Department and rely on their expertise to handle the situation.  We have provided the fire department with our Emergency Response Plan and members of the fire department have inspected the plant.  In addition, Plasti-Kote has a contract with a qualified emergency response firm to aid in the cleanup of a release.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Plasti-Kote has an ongoing and continuing process to audit, update and review our manufacturing process for safety considerations. Based upon this review Plasti-Kote will further investigate changing the leak detection equipment in the tank farm."
