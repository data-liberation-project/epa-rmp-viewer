Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Zero Mountain, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Anhydrous Ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in our system.                                         .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is approximately 34,000 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for our Program 3 toxic substance involves a catastrophic release from the High Pressure Receiver on the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  In this scenario 5791.87 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.   At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.38 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm)(0.14 mg/L).\n\nOne alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) invol"

Toxic gas is assumed to be released.  The entire release is estimated to have occured for 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s) and Ammonia Sensors and Emergency Response from the Haz-Mat Team.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm)(0.14 mg/L) of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.14 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the Safety Relief Valveon the High Pressure Receiver of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. The scenario involves the release of 217.50 lb. of Ammonia vapor.  Toxic gas is assumed to be released to the atmosphere.  The release is estimated to have lasted for 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s) and Ammonia Sensors and Emergency Responce from the Haz-Mat Team.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm)(0.14 mg/L) of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.11 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR-2-1992 Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Machanical Refrigeration Systems.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nZero Mountain, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with our process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts com"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What if...  Methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years or as needed.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/22/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Zero Mountain, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nZero Mountain, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the process are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and usually on a semi-annual basis.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nZero Mountain, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; compressors, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
