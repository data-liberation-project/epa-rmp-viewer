As operator, Camden Water has improved upon this successful program to achieve an even greater level of process safety and risk management at the Water Treatment plant.\n\nAll process safety information is clearly documented in a central location where operators and contractors working on or near the covered process are encouraged to access and review information found therein.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analyses are conducted on a five-year schedule by a process hazard analysis team.  The team is composed of a team leader/process engineer, maintenance specialist, plant superintendent and a process operator.  Vulnerable processes or procedures are identified and recommendations to eliminate the vulnerability to the extent possible are identified. \n\nThe water treatment superintendent using the process safety information in cooperation with the process operator writes the operating procedures used when working on or around the chlorine processes.  The water treatment superintendent and a process operator verify all existing operating procedures for correctness once a year.  Operating procedures are available at the plant.  \n\n Training is formulated and tracked by the plant superintendent according to a training schedule developed to respond to the development needs of the employees.  The plant superintendent keeps the training materials on file.  Written tests, oral exams and demonstration assure understanding of the training.  The Group Health & Safety Officer also tracks training for the site.\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity program assures the continued integrity of process equipment.  The program consists of equiipment lists, preventative maintenance procedures and a time dependent maintenance schedule.  Equipment is replaced prior to the expected useful life of the equipment or if excessive wear that indicates degradation of its effectiv"

The Responsible Manager assures the Mechanical Integrity program.  \n\nThe Management of Change program ensures that system changes are properly reviewed against original design specifications and can be accomplished safely.   It ensures any changes made to the processes will not increase the risk of an accident occurring on the process.  It is composed of a written program with elements delegated to appropriate members of the management team.  The Responsible Manager quality assures the Management of Change Program and keeps all completed Management of Change forms on file.  \n\nThere is a written pre-startup safety review program that ensures that prior to startup,  any changes made to the processes, which require a change in the process safety information, are reviewed to ensure that the process is ready to operate safely.  The pre-startup safety review program is quality assured by the Responsible Manager.  Progress is documented in the Management of Change files.  \n\nCompliance Audits assure that the program remains compliant in all respects.  The audits are led and conducted once a year by the Responsible Manager in cooperation with the delegated personnel implementing the program elements.  Deficiencies are noted and scheduled for system improvements by the delegated program implementers.  The Regional Operations Manager with the Project Engineer monitor scheduled completion dates.  \n\nThe incident investigation program reduces the risk of incidents that come close to causing an accident.  The program follows corporate policy for fact determination, root cause system analysis, and recommendation implementation.  The Regional Operations Manager, together with the Group Health & Safety Officer, monitors system update schedules developed through the compliance audit and incident investigation.  \n\nEmployee Participation is incorporated in each program element description.  \n\nThe Contractor Program follows Camden Water Contractor policy.

Firewalls are used for mitigation systems.  The process areas are monitored by leak detection systems indicated by an audible alarm.  The maintenance program conducts equipment reliability reviews to assure operation of the prevention devices.  \n\nThere have been no accidents resulting in off-site releases.  Minor releases have occurred on two occasions, which have been rapidly controlled on-site.  \n\nThe company's emergency response program for chlorine release is continually revised to ensure that it is current.  The plan defines the response organization, coordination with local emergency response committee, equipment, response procedures, training, notification procedures, and drills.  The plan is tested annually through drills."
