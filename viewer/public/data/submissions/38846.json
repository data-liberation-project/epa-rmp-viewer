Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Chicago Customer Service Center are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Chicago Fire Department, in Cook County, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass storage, transfer and shipping of sulfuric acid and the transfer and shipping of liquid sulfur dioxide . We have one (1) regulated substance, sulfur dioxide present at our facility. The regulated substances at our facility are involved in transfer from rail tank cars to truck cargo tankers. \n\nThe maximum inventory of sulfur dioxide that is expected to be present in this facility based on shipping requirements is 540,000 lbs. \n\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-                                       \n       Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The sulfur dioxide processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.  \n\nProcess Safety Information"

      "SummaryText": "The Chicago Customer Service Center maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three (3) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes,  the Chicago Customer Service Center maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n The Chicago Customer Service Center has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.   Refresher training is provided at least every three (3)  years and more frequently as needed.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n The Chicago Customer Service Center carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, hoses, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Chicago Customer Service Center.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Chicago Customer Service Center conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n The Chicago Customer Service Center promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n The Chicago Customer Service Center truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.   The Chicago Customer Service Center has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractors work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Chicago Customer Service Center has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, No accidental releases have occurred during this period. \n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Chicago Customer Service Center carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  \n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. \n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Vessel and piping thickness testing and replacement of transfer hoses with the SMART hose are some of the major steps we plan to take to improve safety at our facility.
