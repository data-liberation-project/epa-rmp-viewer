The Site was originally built in 1980 and has been owned by RPC since 1985. The Site normally operates 6 days per week, 24 hours per day.\n\n\n\nThe Site manufactures doughnuts, which are frozen for shipment. The Site's North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 31141 (Frozen Food Manufacturing)\n\n\n\nAs part of the refrigeration system to freeze the doughnuts for shipment, the Site handles quantities of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance/highly hazardous chemical, as defined in the USEPA's CAPP and OSHA's PSM standard, in an amount exceeding the regulatory threshold for anhydrous ammonia in a single process, i.e., the Site's refrigeration system. The Site is registered to Program Level 3 under the CAPP program.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the refrigeration system. The Site's engine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nWhile there are few long-term environmental consequences to ammonia use, it can present health hazards if handled improperly. RPC has developed a comprehensive safety program in compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements to ensure the responsible management of the ammonia onsite (the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program, respectively). All refrigeration Associates receive operator training, safe work practices training and training on the standard operating procedures (SOPs). Safety meetings are conducted to further protect Associates and the community as a whole.\n\n\n\nThe Site's prevention program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates and the community in the event of a release or spill.\n\n\n\nThe Site endeavors to eliminate accide"

The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\n\n\n\nThe Site has incorporated many safety features in the design of the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Site's ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shutdown pump and the components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\n\n\n\nRPC considers the health and safety of each Associate as its most important responsibility. It is our policy to provide a healthy and safe work environment. This facility follows operating practices that safeguard all associates and result in safe working conditions while maintaining efficient operations.\n\n\n\nSafety is the responsibility of all Associates. Each associate is expected to comply with the requirements of RPC's Standards for Safety Performance. Management is responsible for the implementation, communication, documentation, and necessary trainin"

Management is committed to maintain a high level of interest in health and safety throughout this facility. This commitment extends to the associates and their involvement in preventing accidents.\n\n\n\nRPC has established its Health and Safety Program to insure that:\n\n\n\n-- Associates work in a healthy and safe environment.\n\n-- Associates are trained on safe work practices.\n\n-- Associates practice safe work habits.\n\n-- Management and associates are both involved in the program.\n\n-- There is constant communication between all Associates on safety issues.\n\n-- Compliance with all regulatory agencies is maintained.\n\n\n\nMajor safety features at the Site include:\n\n\n\n-- Installation of Ammonia leak detectors in processing areas and the engine room\n\n-- Remote emergency shutdown switches for the refrigeration system\n\n-- Fire sprinklers throughout the Site\n\n-- Component specific safety shutdowns of the refrigeration system\n\n-- Water-filled diffusion tank to treat accidental release of ammonia through pressure relief valves, and\n\n-- A proprietary Refrigeration Energy Management System (REMS) computer monitoring system.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Site has reported one accidental release over the last five years. While a release was reported as having been discovered on October 18, 2014, further additional investigations determined that a reportable release had not occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Site is equipped with an emergency warning system. Alarms are placed throughout the Site to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered. RPC has developed specific procedures to be followed in the event of release. These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so. RPC maintains a w"
