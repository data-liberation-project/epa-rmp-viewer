The program is designed to inform all Site employees (hereafter referred to as Associates) of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency response plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, associate training, etc.).\n\n\n\nRPC is guided by a set of core values that include:\n\n\n\n-- Cherish Our Culture - Work, learn and celebrate together;\n\n-- Innovate - Imagine what's possible and create what's valued;\n\n-- Be the Trusted First Choice - Listen, understand and deliver for customers like no other company;\n\n-- Better Our Communities - Devote time and talent where we work and live; and\n\n-- Do What's Right - No matter what.\n\n\n\nRPC is committed to an irrevocable obligation to act responsibly in every decision made and with every person encountered.

The Site was originally built in 1980 and has been owned by RPC since 1985. The Site normally operates 6 days per week, 24 hours per day.\n\n\n\nThe Site manufactures doughnuts, which are frozen for shipment. The Site's North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 31141 (Frozen Food Manufacturing)\n\n\n\nAs part of the refrigeration system to freeze the doughnuts for shipment, the Site handles quantities of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance/highly hazardous chemical, as defined in the USEPA's CAPP and OSHA's PSM standard, in an amount exceeding the regulatory threshold for anhydrous ammonia in a single process, i.e., the Site's refrigeration system. The Site is registered to Program Level 3 under the CAPP program.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the refrigeration system. The Site's engine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nWhile there are few long-term environmental consequences to ammonia use, it can present health hazards if handled improperly. RPC has developed a comprehensive safety program in compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements to ensure the responsible management of the ammonia onsite (the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program, respectively). All refrigeration Associates receive operator training, safe work practices training and training on the standard operating procedures (SOPs). Safety meetings are conducted to further protect Associates and the community as a whole.\n\n\n\nThe Site's prevention program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates and the community in the event of a release or spill.\n\n\n\nThe Site endeavors to eliminate accide"

RPC's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards. An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system. Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike. The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\n\n\n\nThe Site has incorporated many safety features in the design of the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Site's ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shutdown pump and the components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\n\n\n\nRPC considers the health and safety of each Associate as its most important responsibility. It is our policy to provide a healthy and safe work environment. This facility follows operating practices that safeguard all associates and result in safe working conditions while maintaining efficient operations.\n\n\n\nSafety is the responsibility of all Associates. Each associate is expected to comply with the requirements of RPC's Standards for Safety Performance. Management is responsible for the implementation, communication, documentation, and necessary trainin"

While a release was reported as having been discovered on October 18, 2014, further additional investigations determined that a reportable release had not occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Site is equipped with an emergency warning system. Alarms are placed throughout the Site to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered.

These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so. RPC maintains a w"
