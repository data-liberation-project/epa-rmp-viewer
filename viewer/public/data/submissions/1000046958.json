Buckley Water Treatment Plant went into operation in 1966, been very concerned with chemical safety, especially chlorine safety.  Over the first ten years of operation of the water treatment plant, chlorine safety policies and procedures were developed and implemented.  These policies and procedures are continually revised and refined.  As new administrations have come to City Hall, each has supported the commitment to chlorine safety.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance Description\n\n\n\n    The City of Troy, Department of Public Utilities, is responsible for the public water supply for the City and several surrounding communities.  The water is treated at the John P. Buckley Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The plant is a full-scale conventional water plant, manned 24 hours per day, treating an average of 18 MGD.  Chlorine, which is the regulated chemical, is used as a disinfectant at the plant. Prior to the water being treated at the WTP, it is pre-disinfected with chlorine dioxcide at the Melrose Chlorination Station.  The station is located six miles Northeast of the WTP.  The station is an unmanned facility that is attended to by the water plant operators several times per day.  The chlorine is purchased in one ton containers and is extracted and fed as a gas.  An average of 120 pounds per day is used.  Up to six containers may be onsite at a time.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\n\n\n     The worst-case release scenario involves failure of one of the fusible plugs on the ton chlorine container. It is projected as emptying the container in ten minutes, or leaking at the rate of 200 pounds per minute. The worst-case release scenario is predicated on a release from only one container.  Even though it is expected that any leak would be contained within the bui"

The \"Aloha\" software package was used for the modeling.\n\n\n\n    A release of this type would activate the comprehensive City of Troy, Department of Public Utilities, Chlorine Emergency Action Plan, and would involve the City of Troy HAZMAT Team, which also serves as the Rensselaer County HAZMAT Team.\n\n\n\n    Alternate release scenarios involve a leak on a pigtail of the ton chlorine container.   Such a leak could involve a complete shearing of the pigtail, with a release of up to 400 pounds of chlorine before the container \"freezes up\".  The chlorine scales hold two (2) one ton chlorine containers. The regulator allows for both cylinders to be activated through the pig tail to the regulator. When one cylinder is emptied the regulator automatically activates the other cylinder providing a continuous flow of chlorine gas.  Therefore, these scenarios involve less than half of a container leaking due to the \"freeze up\", and functionality of the regulator. Such releases within the building would have complete containment in the building, with no offsite impact expected.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Steps\n\n\n\n    The City of Troy, Department of Public Utilities, complies with the rules and regulations as put forth by the New York State Department of Labor through the Public Employees Safety and Health Bureau.  The rules and regulations are NYS Public Employee Safety and Health (PESH) which are modeled after OSHA.  This includes as examples, the Chlorine Emergency Action Plan, and the Right-to-Know Law utilizing the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  \n\n\n\n    The Department also provides chlorine training for the water treatment plant operators multiple times per year. The training includes, but is not limited to operational procedures, self contained breathing apparatus familiarity, the Chlorine Institute \"B\" repair kit familiarity, feed equipment procedures, and general chlorine safety practices.\n\n\n\n    The facilit"

It encompasses general information, plan implementation, evacuation procedures, onsite coordination, rescue and medical responsibilities and other information.  It is reviewed by water treatment plant personnel as part of the ongoing training program.\n\n\n\n    Periodic discussions are held between the Rensselaer County Bureau of Emergency Services, the City of Troy Fire Department (HAZMAT Team) and the Department of Public Utilities regarding the plan and chlorine safety. The Melrose Volunteer Fire Department has also been trained and holds keys to the treatment facility for emergencies.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n    The instrumentation at the WTP has been upgraded and a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system has been installed.  Parts of the chlorine system have been automated and monitoring and alarms systems have been improved, and incorporated into the system. The Melrose station is fully monitored by the Water Plant Personnel at the water plant.  Training and procedures will be reviewed and revised as required. New scales have also been installed for better record keeping and easier reading.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n    While the City of Troy, Department of Public Utilities is aware of the dangers of chlorine, its use in the water works industry remains a necessity.  The City strives to make its use safe for the employees, the water consumers, and the surrounding residents.     \n\n"
