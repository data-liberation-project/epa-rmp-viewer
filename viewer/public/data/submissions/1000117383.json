The Niles LP Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used for the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Niles, MI. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low sulfur diesel/#2 fuel oil, butane, ethanol, and various petroleum-based additives.\n\nNiles LP Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. MPLX believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\nThe Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. MPLX promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that MPLX has designed and implemented including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances;\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals;\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\nA.

By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Butane Tank Blending Process.\n\nThe Butane Tank Blending process is a batch-type process based on seasonal RVP adjustments. Butane is received by truck (transports) and typically piped to a horizontal storage vessel and subsequently injected into the gasoline recirculation lines associated with atmospheric storage tanks. The process retains the original capabilities to move butane directly from a transport to the point on injection.  Process safety controls for the offloading skid that are used include emergency shutoff valves with a fusible element (rated at < 250 deg. F) with local and remote manual actuation; a check valve for instantaneous closure in the event of a pull-away event, and a \"Smart Hose\" with engineered breakaway capabilities plus self-closing valves at each connection point. The butane storage vessel utilizes Internal/Excess Flow Valves which close in the event of a downstream pipe shear, fire exposure or actuation of the emergency shutdown system.  Other protective measures/system controls include pipe thermal/hydrostatic reliefs and grounding devices. Access to the Facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and approved contractors/visitors.\n\nB.

The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Niles LP Terminal:\n\n1) Employee Participation;\n2) Process Safety Information;\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA);\n4) Standard Operating Procedures;\n5) Training;\n6) Contractors;\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review;\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance;\n9) Hazardous Work Permits;\n10)Management of Change;\n11)Incident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation;\n12)Emergency Response;\n13)Compliance Audits; and\n14)Trade Secrets.\n\nThese fourteen (14) individual elements of this prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. The Niles LP Terminal and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, MPLX also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the Terminal's operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help prevent, identify, contain/control, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures:\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards;\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators;\n-Redundant control systems;\n-Manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of safety devices;\n-Limited/secured facility access;\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;"

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP)/\"Smart Plan\" is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the Niles Township Fire Department (primary responder) and the City of Niles Fire Department (mutual aid).\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Niles LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal keeps records for all incidental and significant chemical releases inclusive of any root cause analyses and associated follow-up actions, where appropriate. There have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the release of materials resulting in consequences covered under the EPA RMP reporting requirements.  The Terminal tracks all process safety incidents per API 754.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Niles LP Terminal is identified as a \"non-responding facility\".

An ERAP/\"Smart Plan\" is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release or fire including implementation of emergency response notification procedures.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Niles (North) LP Terminal butane tank blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Niles Township Fire Department and request their assistance.\n\nThe Niles Township Fire Department and Berrien County Emergency Management participate in annual butane training sessions for this system.\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMPLX is continually striving to make the Niles LP Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for its employees, neighbors and community.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, MPLX actively seeks employee input on process safety improvements. All Process Safety Events (as identified in API 754) are electronically recorded, reviewed, and/or investigated via a root cause analysis (TapRooT) per corporate policy. The Niles Township Fire Department (primary responder) and the City of Niles Fire Department (mutual aid) are contacted regarding participation in site emergency response and/or drills. Additionally, MPLX will work cooperatively with the community to address any concerns."
