This\n\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\n\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\n\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\n\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\n\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant, located in rural Palo Pinto County, Texas, operates a variety of processes\n\nto recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas. Natural gas enters the Plant and is then compressed and sent to a Glycol Dehydration Unit. Propane is compressed and used as a refrigerant. The cooling effect from the expansion is used to cool the inlet gas and drop out liquids. The remaining gas stream is condensed and sent to the Amine Unit. The sweetened liquid product is then placed into one (1) 30,000 gallon and one (1) 15,000 gallon pressurized tanks for storage pending shipment off site. There are no\n\nthreshold quantities of toxic substances present. As such, the Lone Camp Plant is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Lone Camp gas plant. \n\nBecause processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's\n\n(EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety\n\nand Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this\n\nsummary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in\n\nplace to implement the ac"

Employees have access to all information created as part of\n\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the\n\naccident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is\n\nmaintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In\n\naddition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and\n\nemployee safety issues.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\n\noperation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated\n\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\n\ndesign basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned\n\nresponsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The reference documents\n\nand their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help\n\nemployees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\n\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is\n\nsupplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known\n\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

Within this program, each process is\n\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\n\nmanage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the What If analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The\n\nanalyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience\n\nas well as engineering expertise.

Compliance audits are conducted at\n\nleast every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel may participate as audit team members. \n\nThe audit team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions\n\ntaken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution\n\nof each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Lone Camp gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued\n\nsafe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention\n\nof accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized above is applied to all RMP covered processes at\n\nthe Lone Camp gas plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential\n\naccidents that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Lone"

      "SummaryText": " Camp gas plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a\n\nrelease, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety\n\nfeatures are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\nA? Process relief valves\n\nA? Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\nA? Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\nA? Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n- Hydrocarbon detection sensors\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\nA? Fire extinguishers\n\nA? Trained personnel\n\nA? Personal protective equipment\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. \n\nThere have been no releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, property or\n\nenvironmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect the\n\nsafety of workers and the public, as well as the environment.  There are no 112(r) threshold toxic\n\nsubstances on the plant site.  For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance, including the\n\npossibility of a fire, response actions have been coordinated with the local fire department, and\n\nmechanisms for notification are in place.  Employees receive training as necessary to perform\n\ntheir specific emergency actions.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary, and\n\naffected personnel are informed and/or trained in the changes.  \n\n\n\nThe gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and\n\nemergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the\n\npublic of an incident if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident."
