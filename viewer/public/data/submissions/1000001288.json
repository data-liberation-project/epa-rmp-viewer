Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Aervoe Industries Incorporated are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nAervoe Industries Incorporated manufactures a variety of aerosol products, liquid filled containers and fuel containers for portable heating devices.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include butane, Difluoroethane (Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-), Isobutane  (Propane, 2-methyl), Methyl ether  (Methane, oxybis-) and Propane. Butane used in portable heaters as a fuel supply. The other chemicals are used as an aerosol propellant.\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAervoe Industries Incorporated maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.
