We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.

This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\r\n\r\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes. These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies. Hydrite warehouses one chemical regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program. All storage containers are designed to comply with National Standards including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).  Worst case scenarios and alternate scenarios are identified within the RMP.  Hydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance. Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards,\r\nenvironmental hazards and process hazards. Aqua ammonia is regulated by EPA's RMP program. As required by this program, this process undergoes a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular\r\nbasis. Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemical, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new chemicals.  Equip"
