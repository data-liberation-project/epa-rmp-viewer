FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nHaarmann & Reimer (H&R) at Bushy Park, SC,  produces aroma chemicals and cosmetic ingredients.  The H&R corporate headquarters is located In Holtzminden, Germany. ( Haarmann & Reimer GmbH, Muhlenfeldstrasse 1,D-37603, Holzminden, Germany)  The H&R, Bushy Park Site manufactures various forms of menthol, sunscreens, cooling agents, and fragrance specialties.  H&R was formerly a subsidiary of Bayer Corporation who established the Bushy Park site in 1970.  H&R was acquired by EQT Partners on October 1, 2002.  Prior to this date, H&R was included in the RMP considerations of Bayer Corporation who filed their RMP by the statutory deadline.\n\nH&R is located within Bayer's 1650 acre site which is operated as an Industrial Park wherein Bayer owns the land and the various tenants own and operate the assets on the land.  The site is on the Cooper River just a few miles east of Goose Creek, S C.  H&R has contracted with Bayer Corporation to purchase various materials and services.\n\nII. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nH&R is committed to health, the environment and safety.  Haarmann & Reimer considers its responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees, customers and the area communities of primary importance in the conduct of its business.  It is H&R's policy to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to establish and implement responsible practices where laws and regulations do not exist.  Further, H&R will work with government and industry groups to foster the development of appropriate health, environment and safety programs, laws and regulations.  H&R will co"

      "SummaryText": " ensure that all chemicals are handled safely.  We also work closely with our suppliers, other companies, local officials and the public to maintain stringent safety and environmental programs and to minimize risks.  \n\nIn keeping with our commitment, H&R has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases.  Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\nSeveral processes at the site are regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the employee and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  The Bushy Park site is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.  \n\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nA new process is in the final construction stage and is approaching start up. The new process will be in compliance with PSM requirements for the Risk Management Program listed in 40 CFR Part 68.  The new process includes an ammonia refrigeration system and a pentane storage and handling system.  Ammonia is present as liquefied gas under pressure.  It is regulated as a toxic substance.  Pentane is a liquid stored at ambient temperature and is regulated as a flammable material. \n\nH&R will use anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in the new process area. Prior to now, H&R was included in the Bayer RMP for ammonia.  It is delivered via an overhead pipeline system from Bayer Corporation's plant-wide distribution system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor.  Exposure to ammonia can irritate the eyes, nose and throat.  Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\nH&R will "

Pentane is a highly flammable liquid that can reach explosive concentrations in the atmosphere if released without restriction.\n\nIV. RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst case scenarios are included in the plan for ammonia and pentane and an alternative case scenario (or more likely scenario) is included in the plan for each of the two regulated substances.  \n\nH&R receives its liquid ammonia via pipeline from Bayer Corporation.  The worst case scenario for H&R would be Bayer's worst case since most of the liquid ammonia is under Bayer control. The ammonia worst-case scenario is based on the complete failure of the largest process vessel in the Bayer system containing 36,200 pounds of liquid ammonia.  A written operating procedure, high level alarm, and visual level display in the Bayer control room prevent the vessel from being operated with more than 36,200 pounds of liquid ammonia even though the vessel could contain as much as 42,500 pounds.  The maximum distance for the most impacting hypothetical worst case release with no mitigating measures is 2.3 miles to the level of concern (LOC) or toxic end-point.  Several industrial, commercial, residential, public and military facilities are in the potential impact area.\n\nToxic end-point or Level of Concern (LOC)\n\nThe Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 - Level of Concern (ERPG2-LOC) is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or serious health effects, or symptoms which impair their ability to take protective action.  The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the ERPG2-LOC concentration.  The ERPG2-LOC for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or 200 parts per million (ppm).  The concentration (estimated from toxicity data) that is immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) for ammonia is 300 ppm.\n\nHaa"

      "SummaryText": "rmann & Reimer will use pentane as a solvent in the new fragrance chemical manufacturing process.  Pentane will be stored in a 70 m3 tank with a maximum working capacity of 60 m3 or 79,200 pounds of liquid.  The storage tank is located in a diked area (passive mitigation).  The worst case scenario would be the complete failure of the storage tank and all contents spill into the dike.  The dike is considered in the mitigation since it is a passive measure.  In this worst-case scenario, the entire quantity released was assumed to have formed a vapor cloud, which then detonated. The 1 pound per square inch overpressure endpoint (defined in the EPA requirements) for this scenario is the threshold for potentially serious injuries to people from flying glass, falling debris, and other explosion effects.  The distance to the overpressure endpoint for this case would be 0.1 miles.  This distance would effect Bayer Corporation areas around the H&R site but would not impact areas beyond the fence line for the total Bayer Industrial Park.\n\nAll scenarios evaluated used EPA's published model, RMPComp, to provide toxic end-point determinations and flammablity impact based on EPA published levels of concern (LOC).  Other models did not provide satisfactory estimates for use in evaluating the maximum end-point distance.  Public and environmental protection requires conservative results.  Both substances were evaluated for the alternate scenario and the information is included in the plan.  \n\nMore-Likely Scenarios\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and pentane process systems are similar in function.  Each has a storage container or containers and a transfer system which includes transfer pump(s) and piping to deliver the material to an end use function.  The more likely scenario for each could  involve a breach in the integrity of the piping system.  A flange leak or rupture could constitute a likely potential for a release of the regulated substance.  The ammonia piping system is constructed with"

Flanged connections are used for pumps, vessel attachment  and critical control valves so they can be taken out easily when repair or replacement is necessary.  \n\nThe pentane piping system is similar, but with a combination of flanged and welded pipe up to the diked storage vessels and transfer pump.  The opportunity for leaks and/or ruptures is greater.  Since the pentane system will be new to operations, no accident history for handling pentane is available for comparison.  Similar systems in operation were considered.\n\nThe alternative scenario is a hypothetical release that is more realistic than the worst-case scenario.  In this scenario, safety and emergency systems operate as expected, and plant personnel respond to take action to control and stop the release.\n\nAmmonia scenario assumptions:\n\n+ Partial failure of the piping system containing ammonia liquid under pressure. \n+ Detection of ammonia by instruments or personnel in the area, shutdown of the ammonia supply equipment by remote control, and closure of valves by site personnel to stop the leak.\n+ Release during typical weather conditions experienced at the site.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia is based on a 1.0 inch diameter hole (broken pipe nozzle) in the pressure vessel at a flanged connection (gas side) containing liquid and gaseous ammonia that would release 192 pounds of ammonia gas per minute.  The time to discovery and system shut down is based on a 20-minute release.  The distance to the toxic end-point is estimated to be 0.1 miles using EPA's RMP*Comp model.

The amount lost (898 pounds) would be the contents of the hose and the amount of pentane that would flow out of the tank truck before the attending operator could shut off  the emergency valve.   The time to discovery and system shut down is based on a 1-minute release.  The distance to the lower flammability limit for this regulated substance under the RMP Rule is estimated to be 0.1 miles using EPA's RMP*Comp model.  The impact area is within the Bayer Industrial Park fence-line.\n\nV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past five years H&R has not experienced any release of ammonia or pentane that requires listing in the RMP information we are submitting.  \n\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nIncident and Emergency Guidelines\n\nH&R has multiple safeguards in place to ensure safe handling of ammonia and pentane and to prevent releases of these substances.  Our facility is prepared to handle emergencies such as hurricanes and tornadoes as well as chemical releases.  In the unlikely event a release occurs, we work to contain the release quickly and to minimize its impact on plant personnel and neighbors.  If a release occurs equipment that supplies the regulated substance would be shut down quickly by remote control.\n\nH&R is a partner in the Bayer Industrial Park.  Bayer manages the Industrial Park Emergency Operations Center (EOC) that H&R participates in.  If a release occurs, the EOC is activated and the follow actions are implemented:\n+ The plant alarm would be sounded and the emergency communicated to plant personnel over the emergency alert system.\n+ Trained on-site emergency response teams would be activated and take prompt action to control and stop the release. \n+ Emergency response personnel would eva"
