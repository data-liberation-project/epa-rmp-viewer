Compressor Rooms #1 and #2 work together to supply Apio, Inc. and Obispo Street Cooling with ammonia for their process equipment.  Compressor Rooms #1 and #2 are equipped with 750 and 3000 gallon liquid receivers, respectively.  These rooms have the capability to compress and condense the ammonia vapor from the various refrigerated devices throughout the three facilities.  This ammonia vapor is similarly condensed and recycled back to the Compressor Room liquid receivers.\n\n*Obispo Street Cooling*\n\nOblispo Street Cooling receives liquid ammonia from the Block Ice Plant liquid receiver with the Compressor Rooms liquid receivers acting as a backup.  The ammonia is delivered to two accumulators that supply liquid ammonia to 19 evaporators and two hydro-coolers.  The evaporators are located in several cooler rooms within a large warehouse.

These emergency procedures are summarized in the following three subsections. \n\nResponse Organization and Notification Procedures \nIn the event of an emergency (fire, ammonia release or spill), the operator will immediately notify the Emergency Coordinator or alternate response personnel.  The Emergency Coordinator or response personnel on duty will determine whether immediate notification of local emergency response agencies is necessary.  For emergencies they will call 911.  For non-emergencies they will initiate action procedures and then contact the necessary agency.\n\nEmployees are notified of emergency conditions by use of the telephone speaker feature.  The Emergency Coordinator or alternate response personnel will notify the Puritan employees of the conditions and give instructions as to whether or not to evacuate and if so, which route is the safest.\n\nThe State of California requires that any release or threatened release must be immediately reported to the proper agencies immediately unless the release poses no significant potential hazard to human safety, health, property or process equipment.  The exact location of release, name of person reporting the incident, type of material involved, estimated quantity, and potential hazards due to release must be reported to the agencies.\n\nEvacuation Routes and Procedures\nIn the event of an emergency, the Emergency Coordinator or alternate emergency response personnel will initiate an evacuation of the facility.  Puritan is equipped with an evacuation horn to notify all personnel to commence evacuation procedures that are outlined in the Action Plan.  Emergency evacuation routes are posted in the main office, the employee lunch room, and the maintenance shop.

These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe facilities have coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of the facilities to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.\n\nA majority of the ammonia equipment is located inside the engine rooms.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nPuritan Ice Company, Apio, Inc. and Obispo Street Cooling (Facility) are the three facilities that utilize the same ammonia refrigeration system.  The system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The system has a low pressure or low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high pressure or high side, where the refrigerant vapor gives off heat as it is condensed back into a liquid.  (In operation the system basically moves heat from the low side to the high side.)  Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulated enclosure where goods are processed, chilled, or frozen.  \n\nAmmonia is the regulated substance of concern.  There is approximately 17,000 pounds of ammonia in this single process.\n\n*Puritan Ice Company*\n\nThe ammonia used by all three facilities originates at the Puritan Ice liquid receiver.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAdministrative Measures\nThe facilities have implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the Cal-OSHA 5189 regulation. The training program at the Puritan Ice Company encompasses an assortment of personnel with varying degrees of responsibilities.  Therefore, the training  differs depending on the type of position an employee holds.  The minimum amount of training provided to facility employees, includes the following:\n\n1.  Safe handling of hazardous materials including the health hazard associated with the hazardous material(s) used, proper handling procedures and precautions, and personal protective equipment which must be worn or used during certain operations.  This is be achieved by introducing and explaining the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).\n\n2.  Procedures for notifying and coordinating local emergency response organizations.\n\n3.  Use of emergency supplies under control of the handler for spills, fire, disposal and first aid.\n\n4.  The emergency response plan and procedures specified in the Process Safety Management document.\n\nEngineering Measures\nThe Puritan Group facilities were designed to generate ice and provide cold room storage through the use of ammonia refrigeration systems.  Most of the ammonia systems are based on a time monitoring operation.  Some are manually monitored while others are automatically operated by use of a computer controller system.  These control systems and safety features are described in the following subsections.\n\nBuilding and structures were constructed according to local, state and federal codes at the time of construction.  The Puritan Ice Compressor Rooms #1 and #2 refrigeration equipment and construction has been designed to conform with the UBC, UPB, UMC ANSI B15 and ANSI B31.5 la"

In addition, all structural steel conforms to the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Specification A-36 and all structural tubing conforms to ASTM A-500, Grade A.  All concrete work at the facility complies with the Uniform Building Code (UBC) Chapter 26.\n\nThe alarm and monitoring systems at the Puritan Group facilities consist of numerous equipment status indicators (pressure, temperature, liquid level and electrical power).  Some of the equipment indicators are remote and monitored by operators during daily rounds whereas others are controlled and monitored by a computer system.  There are several types of equipment status indicators throughout the facility: pressure, temperature, level, and flow.  These indicators monitor the status of the different devices.  Some status indicators send an alarm to the control system, others trigger another device to start up or shut off, and some are remote indicators that are monitored on a routine basis during operations.\n\nThe screw compressors in the Puritan Compressor Rooms are linked to a Compressor Control System (CCS) which is accessible through a computer modem connection.  The CCS was developed by M&M Refrigeration, Inc., the manufacturer of the compressors.  All information regarding the CCS was provided by the Compressor Control System Operations Manual, written by M&M Industrial Refrigeration Computer Control Systems, 1990.  This system is designed to provide continuously updated information as to the status of the compressors and allow the operator to make operational changes to the compressors from a remote location.  \n\nThe CCS is equipped with a STOP key that acts as a remote shut down butt"

      "SummaryText": "the emergency, then the accident investigator should be notified.  The accident investigator then proceeds to consider sever questions as to the incidents surrounding the emergency.  The questions are numerous and include finding out key elements as to the occurrence of the accident.  Some key questions include the following:  \n\n1) Who was involved?  \n2) What was the accident? \n3) When did it occur? \n4) Why did the operator react the way he did? \n5) Where did the accident occur? How did he get injured? \n6) How could this be avoided in the future?\n\nAll ammonia leaks, regardless of size, are reported to the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.  Finally, the refrigeration service organization is notified to assist in putting the plant back on-line following an ammonia release.\n\nEvacuation Routes and Procedures\nIn the event of an emergency requiring evacuation, personnel will be instructed to vacate the premises to the designated assembly area.  This is upwind of the release and typically at the northwest corner of the facility (as for Puritan and Oblispo Street Cooling).  \n\nMitigation Measures\nA group response team will be established to assess the situation and be available to assist the Fire Department.  All personnel are required to evacuate the facility in the event of an ammonia release.  Certain trained personnel are authorized to shut down the ammonia refrigeration system while exiting the area; however, the installation of ammonia sensors is the primary mitigation measure for shutting down the system.\n\nF.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAn initial Process Hazard Analysis study was conducted at the facility in 1992.  In addition, a Seismic Risk Assessment was conducted by a structural engineering firm that same year.  On March 23, 1999, a  Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study was performed to review these two previous studies, examine new equipment and modifications, and conduct additional analyses for compliance with the new CalARP Program and EPA R"

A fire hydrant, fire extinguishers, and gas masks (for escape purposes only) are located throughout the facility to aid the Fire Department in fire fighting, ammonia neutralization, repairs, and emergency escape.  Also available in the employee room and engineer room are personal protection equipment (for cleanup and/or maintenance only) including neoprene gloves, rubber boots, pants and jackets, full face shields, and eyewash and shower.  \n\nThe gas masks available at Puritan are compact air purifying units used during maintenance of ammonia equipment for escape purposes only or if there is an excessive concentration of ammonia present.  Maintenance personnel are required to wear gas masks when installing, adjusting, or repairing refrigeration equipment and there is a possibility of an accidental release of liquid or vapor ammonia.  Puritan has implemented a Respiratory Inspection Program to ensure that all necessary personnel are fitted and familiar with the masks.  This program also ensures that all respiratory equipment is maintained in safe working condition by regularly inspecting, cleaning, and repairing the equipment. \n\nEmergency Action Plans for earthquakes and Hazardous Materials Containment are included in the Action Plan.  The MSDS for ammonia is also provided in the Action Plan.  The Action Plan also contains a Hazardous Materials Emergency Medical Plan which includes procedures for ammonia burns and ammonia poisoning by inhalation, eyes, or internally.  The Puritan Ice Company performs annual fire and ammonia spill drills both with and without the participation of the local fire department.\n\n*OBISPO STREET COOLING*\n\nObispo Street Cooling's emer"

There are designated responsible personnel that will assist the Fire Department in the event of an ammonia release.  Below is a summary of the Obispo Street Cooling emergency response procedures.\n\nNotification and Evacuation Procedures\nIn the event of an ammonia release, the first witness will notify the shift supervisor.  The shift supervisor will alert the employees to evacuate by use of the voice activated intercom system.  He will be responsible for designating the evacuation route and assembly area.  Typically, this is up wind or at the northwest corner of the facility (as for Puritan).\n\nMitigation Measures\nThe Obispo Street Cooling facility is equipped with a respirator which is located in the dispatch office for escape purposes only.  Fire extinguishers are located in various locations throughout the plant along with two fire hoses at critical locations.\n\n*APIO, INC.*\n\nApio's Injury and Illness Prevention Program (Prevention Program), was designed to ensure a safe and healthful working environment.  The policy at Apio is to identify and correct unsafe conditions and work practices before an incident can occur.  The Prevention Program outlines the company safety policy, responsibilities, accident investigation, and proper safety training procedures required to provide a safe work place.  \n\nApio's Emergency Response Plan is outlined in the Standard Operating Procedures and focuses on responding to ammonia releases.\n\nResponse Organization and Notification Procedures \nIn the event of an accident, the operator should immediately notify his supervisor.  During the first few moments of the event, the witness should assess the situation as follows:\n\n1) How severe is the problem?\n2) Is there any personnel in danger?\n3) What is running at the time?\n4) Where is the leak source?\n5) What can be done about the leak?\n6) Has the hazard communication process been initiated?\n\nIf the operator was able to extinguish"

      "SummaryText": "isk Management Program regulations.\n\nOn August 23, 2001, the status of the recommendations was updated and the following recommendations remain.  It is expected that these recommendations will be implemented by January 2002.\n\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation (April 2004) provided mitigation measures to improve safety for the three companies.  The PHA was comprised of two sessions that included a discussion of any changes to the ammonia system since the 1999 PHA revalidation, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the 1999 PHA revalidation and 2002 PSM/RMP audit, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, a review of safety checklists, a site inspection, and a seismic inspection.  Changes due to above mentioned items are scheduled to be completed by April, 2005.\n\nIn addition the three companies are planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP/CalARP and safety programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining PSM/RMP/CalARP and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
