Bakery Chef is a food processing plant located in Kent, Washington, a suburb of the Seattle metropolitan area. Bakery Chef mixes, cooks and freezes pancakes, french toast and waffles. This plant was originally constructed in 1984 and, as is true with most industrial plants, has undergone modifications and additions over the years. This plant is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program rule as it has an ammonia refrigeration system that contains more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia. Bakery Chef has complied with both the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and the EPA Risk Management Program rule   The City of Kent is located approx. 10 miles South and East of Seattle and the Bakery Chef plant is located in an industrial park. This area is almost exclusively industrial and commercial establishments. The nearest residential neighborhoods are located more than a milefrom the plant site. Topographically, the site is in a river valley where the valley walls are just over two miles east of the site at the nearest point.  There are no schools or hospitals within the impact zone of the worst case   scenario. Two parks are located within the worst case scenario zone.  With a significant release of 500 pounds or more of ammonia, the affected receptors would be employees of adjacent or nearby businesses. In an emergency, these businesses would be contacted by phone to initiate their emergency plans. With regard to wildlife, the Green River flows near the plant site and there are those resident wild animals that are expected in urban settings (squirrels, raccoons, rodents and many bird species). No endangered animals have been seen in this area. The Bakery Chef plant is committed to a strong safety and accident prevention program. A positive relationship has been developed with the Kent Fire Department who provides HAZMAT response in this location. Once the plan is implemente"
