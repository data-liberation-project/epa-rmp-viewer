We have strategically located this facility to be away from residence housing and business buildings. It is also placed to benefit from prevailing winds that move to the northeast and over farmland, the opposite direction to the town. The facility is used only for storage of anhydrous ammonia and the filling of anhydrous ammonia wagons for delivery to our farm customers. The amount of anhydrous ammonia at this location will vary from 1 ton to 110 tons. The months from December through May are the peak time of anhydrous ammonia storage and movement. The months from June through November are the periods when a minimum amount of anhydrous ammonia (1 to 10 ton) is stored.\n     The owner and managers at Sabina Farmers Exchange, Inc. plan and implement safety programs throughout the company. All new technology available to insure a safe working environment for all employees is evaluated for addition on an annual basis. The specific anhydrous ammonia safety program is evaluated each year to meet company standards as well as federal and state mandates.    \n     The anhydrous ammonia facility is completely enclosed by a 10 foot high, chain linked fence with strands of barbed wire on top to prevent vandalism. The 2 entrance gates are locked at all times when an employee is not on site. We also have complete area lighting that comes on at dusk to give ideal visual inspection 24 hours each day. A placard that states emergency telephone numbers for the fire department, emergency response service, and company employees in charge of the facility are posted outside of the fence for easy access. \n     Safety programs and equipment are implemented throughout the facility. The facility is away from our main plant so we provide a telephone and 2-way radio for emergency use. There is a 100 gallon open tank of fresh wate"

Water is the ideal treatment for skin that has been exposed to anhydrous ammonia.  Goggles and rubber gloves are provided at the location for any employee working there. All safety equipment and anhydrous ammonia equipment is safety checked each year by the fertilizer plant manager of Sabina Farmers Exchange, Inc. A separate annual inspection and approval is made independently by the Ohio Department of Agriculture.  All employees of Sabina Farmers Exchange, Inc. that work with anhydrous ammonia, attend an anhydrous ammonia training school. All newly hired employees that work with anhydrous ammonia and employees needing retraining attend this seminar on an annual basis.\n     We coordinate training with the local fire department and the emergency response service. We give a complete tour of the facility. At this time we educate the group on how the equipment functions, where potential dangers exist, and give expedient procedures to reach managers of Sabina Farmers Exchange, Inc.    \n     We have had no anhydrous ammonia injuries in the past 5 years. There was no problem with people in the area of the facility or residences requiring precautionary evacuation during the past 5 years.     \n\n      Worst-case release scenario:\n      This scenario is based on the release of 156,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This would only occur if a direct collision with the storage tanks occurred causing the tank to rupture. The impact to the offsite area would be dependent on wind direction and speed. If the prevailing wind direction (southwest to northeast) occurred, the impact would be the anhydrous ammonia traveling across the highway in the path of traffic. This would effect the visibility of the highway and could affect those driving through the vapor. If the wind direction occurred to the south during this release, the impact would affect 40 to 50 residences in Sabina and "

This would require evacuation of this area immediate area until the vapor dissipated. \n     Alternative release scenario:\n     This scenario is based on the release of 50 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This would occur if a hose burst or a leak occurred in a connection at storage tanks. The impact to the offsite area would be dependent on wind direction and speed. If the prevailing wind direction (southwest to northeast) occurred, there would be no impact to the area. This amount of anhydrous ammonia would immediately dissipate in the air, having no effect. If the wind direction occurred to the south during this release, the impact could affect 1 residence in the area between the anhydrous ammonia facility and Sabina. This would not require evacuation, but there could be a brief period of an offensive smell until the vapor dissipated. \n     Sabina Farmers Exchange, Inc. has stored anhydrous ammonia for 25 years. In that 25 years, we have never experienced an injury or had a release from that site that has caused a problem. We will continue to maintain the people, equipment, and training to make the next 25 years just as safe."
