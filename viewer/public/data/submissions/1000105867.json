Administrative controls include utilizing a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspect the facility processes.  Mitigative controls include as high pressure / overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\n\n(d)\tThe five-year accident history\n\nThe Totem Storage facility has had no release of a regulated substance in the past five years where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressures generated by explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat from a fire involving the substance resulted in one or more offsite deaths, injuries, or response or restoration activities for exposure of an environmental receptor.\n\n(e)\tThe emergency response program\n\nThis facility maintains a written emergency plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. The Emergency Plan is provided to assist personnel who react to and respond to plant emergencies. It contains information relating to recognition and reporting of emergencies, minimizing hazards, and actions that must be taken to protect personnel, property and gas service. The objective of the Emergency Plan is to assure that personnel who could be involved in an emergency are adequately trained to recognize and deal with emergency situations in an expeditious and safe manner.\n\nFacility personnel are trained to take defensive or incipient firefighting actions. Local fire departments will be responsible for extinguishing fires that have gone beyond the incipient stage.  Therefore, this plan is limited to providing guidance for our employees to evacuate the facility and notify the appropriate authorities.\n\nEmployees receive training in these procedures, as necessary, to perform their specific emergency plan duties.

      "SummaryText": "(a)\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nPublic and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI).  Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all KMI facilities.  KMI facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes / standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  KMI facilities are equipped with many engineering safeguards (e.g.:  pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response.\n \n(b)\tRegulated substances handled\n\nThis facility is primarily involved in the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from a gas stream. As part of this process, we handle several regulated, flammable substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. There are no such quantities of regulated toxic substances handled at Totem. The following RMP-regulated flammables are found at Totem:\n\nEthane\nMethane\nPropane\nIso-Butane\nButane\nIso-Pentane\nPentane\n\n(c)\tThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nIn accordance with 40CFR 68.25, 68.167 and EPA guidance, one worst-case release scenario (WCRS) and offsite consequences analysis (OCA) was prepared for each Program 1 process.  Alternate release scenarios were not required.  These WCRSs assumed the rupture of the largest NGL storage tank.  Such a release has the potential for the formation of a vapor cloud that could explode when exposed to an ignition source.  Using the EPA's RMPComp software, the WCRSs distances/endpoints were calculated to be 0.5 miles from the NGL storage tank.  Based on this calculation, and a visual examination of the latest available overhead photography from Google Earth, it was determined that no public receptors were within the WCRS for any process."
