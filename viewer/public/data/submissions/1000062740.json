We operate our business in a manner that consciously safeguards our employees, customers and communities in which we do business.  In striving for responsible environmental, health & safety (EH&S) stewardship, Calpine pledges to:\n\n*  Diligently develop, construct and operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes pollution prevention and places the highest priority on health and safety.\n\n*  Operate facilities that meet or exceed all applicable federal, state and local EH&S rules, regulations, ordinances and statues as well as recognized industry guidelines and standards.\n\n*  Continually measure, evaluate and improve our EH&S performance.\n\n*  Prmote EH&S awareness that fosters a caring, ownership-driven culture among employees, contractors and vendors.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Baytown Energy Center (BEC), located in Baytown, Texas, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity.  As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the three gas-fired combustion turbines, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in two dedicated, specially designed storage tanks.  The storage capacity of each tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.  There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds.\n\n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, the worst case scenario is the highly unlikely catastrophic rupture of one of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  The release duration is ten minutes.  The 14,200-gallon tank is limited to 85% of the storage capacity by administrative controls, including operating procedures and high level alarms.  The EPA's RMP*Comp, version 1.06 was used in the analysis.  Passive mitigation exists in the form of a dike around the"

Based on the analysis, public and environmental receptors would be affected by the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario, although unlikely, is a more realistic scenario than the worst-case scenario.  It was analyzed as the failure of a 2-inch pipe connection at the bottom of the tank.  The release would be mitigated via excess flow valves and a water deluge system installed around the outside of the tank.  The EPA's Risk Management Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used in the analysis.  Based on the analysis, public receptors would be affected by the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBEC is subject to OSHA's PSM standard and Program 3 of EPA's RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention program at BEC includes:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAll BEC employees are actively encouraged to participate in the accidental release prevention program.  Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs.  Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis.  Employees have access to all information required under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBEC maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  These documents include information concerning the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process technology, and process equipment.  This information is updated when changes in the process occur.  Information concerning the hazards of ammonia includes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical, reactivity, corrosivity, and  thermal and stability data.\n\n\n\nInformation concerning the process technology includes process flow information, maximu"

The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  The plant has a system in place to ensure that PHA recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nBEC maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal operations and temporary operations.  The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The procedures are readily available to operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified annually.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAll operations personnel of BEC are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia process and the procedures to safely operate the process.  Operations personnel will receive refresher training every three years.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nBEC uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors will work on or near the ammonia process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are aware of the hazards of the process, understand what to do in the event of an emergency, understand site safety rules, and inform"

Calpine also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nBEC conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or significant facility modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental release prevention programs are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nBEC has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief  systems, controls, pumps and emergency shutdown systems, in a safe operating condition.  The program includes:  (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identified equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.  \n\n\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nBEC has a hot work permit program in place to ensure worker and process safety.  The hot work permit program is designed to control spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the process area.

The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel (including contractors). \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, BEC will conduct a compliance audit every three years.  The facility will quickly resolve any deficiencies noted by the audit team, and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\n\n\n\nAdditional Safety Systems\n\nBEC has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, as well as systems to lessen the impact of accidental releases.  These systems include:\n\n*  Redundant instrumentation to monitor critical process parameters\n\n*  Redundant critical equipment\n\n*  Automated shutdown systems\n\n*  Pressure relief valves\n\n*  Water deluge system to wash ammonia vapors out of the air\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nBEC began commercial operation in 2002.
