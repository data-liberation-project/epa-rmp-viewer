      "SummaryText": "The Borough of Chambersburg (Borough) takes pride in observing the required safety precautions in\n\npreventing hazards in the workplace, and has an emergency response plan in effect in the event of\n\naccidental releases of regulated substances. The emergency response plan is tailored for the water\n\ntreatment facility owned and operated by the Borough. The Borough employs the latest technology in\n\nprocess controls and monitoring detection systems. Active and passive mitigation systems are designed to minimize the impacts of any accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Borough Water Treatment Plant (WTP) provides water service to residential, commercial and\n\nindustrial users in the Borough of Chambersburg, Greene, Guilford and Hamilton Townships, as well\n\nas to the Bear Valley Water Authority through an interconnection, all in Franklin County. The Borough\n\nWTP utilizes one (1) chemical at the WTP which is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention provisions found at 40 CFR Part 68. This toxic substance is chlorine, which has a threshold quantity\n\nof 2,500 pounds under Part 68. Chlorine is used for disinfection of the treated drinking water prior to its distribution to customers.\n\n\n\nTypically, there are one (1) one-ton cylinder and three (3) 150-pound cylinders of chlorine present\n\nonsite at any given time, for a combined total quantity of 2,450 pounds. However, during times of\n\nemergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there are provisions to store three (3) one-ton cylinders and three (3) 150-pound cylinders onsite for a combined total quantity of 6,450 pounds, thus making the WTP subject to the RMP reporting requirements. The chlorine cylinders are located in the chlorine supply room, a separate room with two (2) means of egress near the entrance to the water treatment plant. The room containing the vessels vents to the outside. Chlorine deliveries are scheduled in advance and an operator is always available to assist with the delivery.\n\n\n\nA remote alarm "

The facility is manned 16 hours per day from 0700 to 2300 hours, 7 days per week. Gates to the facility are locked when personnel are not present so that the chlorination building is not accessible to the public. The door to the chlorine room is kept locked at all times.\n\n\n\nA prevention program policy document is developed for the Borough's WTP in accordance with regulations found at 40 CFR ??68.48-68.60. The WTP is classified as a Program 2 facility. The Borough's Program 2 Prevention Program summarizes the pertinent safety information, hazard review procedures, operating procedures, training requirements, maintenance procedures, compliance audits and incident investigation policies.\n\n\n\nThe facility has standard operating procedures (SOPs) in effect for operation and maintenance of the\n\nchlorination system. The Borough has also developed SOPs for changing cylinders, chlorine leak response, preventive maintenance, start-up and shut down of chlorine system, storage, troubleshooting leaks, testing chlorine feed systems and unloading cylinders.\n\n\n\nThe SOPs are readily accessible to the chlorine building. Safety precautions include, checking the\n\nchlorine detector before entering the chlorine storage room, use of a face mask and other appropriate personal protective equipment, and testing for leaks with ammonia solution. A chlorine emergency kit \"A\" for 150-pound cylinders and a kit \"B\" for 1-ton containers are available to contain small leaks and for minor repairs. Appropriate training on the use of the chlorine kits is provided to all employees. Other training plant operators are offered include: confined space entry, right-to-know, first aid and CPR. Documentation of the training events for each employee is maintained in the\n\nemployees' personnel file.\n\n\n\nThe Borough maintains an Emergency Response Plan for the water system based on PA DEP's template for water"
