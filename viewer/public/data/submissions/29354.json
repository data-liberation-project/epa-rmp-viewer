      "SummaryText": "GENERAL:\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.155, this executive summary includes a brief description of the following program elements:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the Ferro facility;\nThe Ferro facility and regulated substances handled;\nThe worst case release scenario;\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific steps;\nThe five year accident history;\nThe emergency response program; and\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe Ferro facility maintains this RMP in accordance with Section 112(r) of the CAA in addition to a Spill Prevention Report in accordance with New York State?s Chemical Bulk Storage (CBS) regulations (6 NYCRR Parts 595-599). Both of these documents include accidental release prevention provisions for the TiCl4 process at the facility. Additionally, the Ferro facility maintains a Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan which includes provisions for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of TiCl4. Further details regarding Ferro?s accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are included in Section 7 of this RMP and in the response plan presented in Appendix A.\n\nFERRO FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nAs discussed in Section 1 and 2 of this RMP, the Ferro facility stores up to 5,000 gallons (72,350 pounds) of liquid TiCl4 in one 5,000 gallon aboveground storage tank, which exceeds the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds specified in the 112(r) rule. The TiCl4 is used to provide titanium for the ceramic manufacturing process.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case release scenario consists of an instantaneous release of the entire maximum contents (up to 72,350 pounds) of the TiCl4 tank into the existing secondary containment area. The actual rate of release of TiCl4 to air is based on the volatilization rate of the liquid TiCl4 pool in the secondary containment area. Therefore, air dis"

      "SummaryText": "persion modeling was performed as part of this worst case scenario to evaluate the distance to the TiCl4 toxic endpoint. The air dispersion modeling results indicated that the distance to the TiCl4 toxic endpoint is approximately 39 feet. As shown on the facility layout drawing in Figure 2, the TiCl4 tank is located well within the fenceline of the facility with the nearest fenceline being approximately 300 feet from the TiCl4 storage tank. There are no public or environmental receptors located within a 39 foot radius of the TiCl4 storage tank. The air dispersion model also indicated that elevated concentrations of Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) gas would be formed during a worst case release scenario, as TiCl4 strongly reacts with moisture in the air. Since HCL is not stored above a threshold quantity, it was not considered as part of this RMP. However, Ferro currently has plans to install a system to alleviate this situation.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe TiCl4 process at the Ferro facility is in compliance with Section 112(r) of the CAA and the New York State CBS regulations. Chemical-specific prevention steps are included in the facility?s CBS Spill Prevention Report.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Ferro facility has not experienced any accidental releases of TiCl4 in the past five years (March 1994-May 1999).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Ferro facility maintains a Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan which includes emergency response procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of TiCl4. The Plan has been coordinated with local emergency response agencies, including the State Emergency Response Commission. The Plan also includes provisions for public notification in the event of a release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Ferro facility currently has plans to install a foam suppression system at the TiCl4 storage tank location. In the event of a release of TiCl4 to the secondary containment area, the foam suppression s"
