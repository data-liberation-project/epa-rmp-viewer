This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Lonesome Creek Generating Station is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nBEPC\u0092s Lonesome Creek Station (LCS) is a natural gas-fired peaking station located northwest of Williston. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction process. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in two interconnected tanks, each containing a maximum of 8,500 labs of ammonia. Since LCS has more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, it is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") and comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 68. \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe BEPC LCS RMP Program is led by an RMP Management Team dedicated to the establishment of management systems that successfully implement the various elements of the Program. BEPC has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements for anhydrous ammonia. The following sections briefly d"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, BEPC maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nBEPC has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nBEPC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CF"

Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review [PSSR] [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routinely at BEPC. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nBEPC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nBEPC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nBEPC believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, BEPC employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nBEPC has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work perm"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. BEPC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nThe BEPC LCS facility has not had any RMP reportable accidents.\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nBEPC LCS maintains an Emergency Action Plan along with periodic training that details procedures for how to handle emergency situations quickly and effectively with minimum hazard to the employees involved. In addition to protecting employee safety, the procedures are in place to minimize damage to equipment, minimize interruption of operations, and coordinate outside response to emergency situations. BEPC LCS is also included in the community emergency response plan and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. \nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nThe facility will ensure that the employees are fully trained in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia process, emergency response, chemical and equipment hazards, and all the requirements of the Program prior to working on the ammonia process. At the time of this submission, BEPC has addressed all recent PHA and audit recommendations and has conducted a training that details the RMP Prevention Program for all managers to ensure a well-run program.
