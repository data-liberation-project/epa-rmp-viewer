The West Memphis Terminal complies with the Arkansas Liquified Petroleum Gas Board\u0092s requirements for LP-Gas Storage, and it is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy to notify the West Memphis Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\nThe West Memphis Terminal is a bulk terminal that receives LPG by pipeline, railcar, and truck transport.  LPG is stored at the West Memphis Terminal and distributed by customer truck transports, or railcar.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe West Memphis Terminal has developed and implemented the following general accidental release and prevention program elements in accordance with all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) accident prevention rule, all the elements of OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, Arkansas Liquified Petroleum Gas Board\u0092s codes and regulations.\n\nProcess Safety Information: The West Memphis Terminal has compiled written process safety information for all PSM covered processes. The process safety information includes the hazards of chemicals used or produced in the process, process technology information, and process equipment data. The process safety information is updated whenever process changes are made.\nAccurate and complete process safety information enables the West Memphis Terminal employees involved in operating and maintaining the terminal to identify and understand the hazards of the process. Process safety information is used to conduct process hazard analysis on the existing process or a proposed modification to"

Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommended additional controls, as appropriate.\nThe West Memphis Terminal uses the \u0093HAZOP\u0094 and \"what if\" methodology, which is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accidental prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and / or mitigation measures.\n\nAs a minimum the West Memphis Terminal performs periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 years as long as the process is operating.\nPHA findings and recommendations and their resolution are documented. The West Memphis Terminal has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner through a written schedule. All PHA findings and recommendation resolutions are communicated to all affected employees. All recommendations must be resolved by management.\n\nOperating Procedures: The West Memphis Terminal has developed and implemented written operating procedures that describe the tasks that terminal operators and transport drivers must perform, the safe process operating parameters that must be maintained, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities. The West Memphis Terminal written operating procedures address various modes of process operations, including: (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround.\nContractors: The West Memphis Terminal has developed and implemented a program to ensure that contract"
