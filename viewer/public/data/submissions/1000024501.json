Facility Identification\n\nThe Watershed Foods facility is located at 202 North Ford Street in Gridley, Illinois.  The facility is a supplier of freeze-dried ingredients. The NAICS code for the facility is 311423. \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for cold storage and freeze drying product. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the Freezer refrigeration system is approximately 10,000 pounds.  The Freezer refrigeration system is used to cool the main freezer area, USDA Cooler, Slicing Room, Shipping and Receiving Dock, Yogurt Production Room, and Holding Room.  This system is a single stage system with three (3) low stage compressors.  Evaporators are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the recirculator.\n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the Dryer refrigeration system is approximately 7,000 pounds.  The Dryer refrigeration system is used to freeze dry fruit and yogurt.  It is a single stage system with two (2) low stage compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the recirculator. \n\n\n\nThe total amount of ammonia onsite, considering the quantities in the Freezer and Dryer ammonia refrigeration systems, is approximately 17,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.

Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed throughout this document Watershed Foods is actively working on improving this program. \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was conducted on June 8 and 9, 2010, and the next audit will occur before June 8 and 9, 2013, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - Watershed Foods has updated a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - Watershed Foods maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - Watershed Foods has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to "
