Watershed Foods is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Watershed Foods policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

The facility is a supplier of freeze-dried ingredients. The NAICS code for the facility is 311423. \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for cold storage and freeze drying product. \r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the Freezer refrigeration system is approximately 10,000 pounds.  The Freezer refrigeration system is used to cool the main freezer area, USDA Cooler, Slicing Room, Shipping and Receiving Dock, Yogurt Production Room, and Holding Room.  This system is a single stage system with three (3) low stage compressors.  Evaporators are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the recirculator.\r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the Dryer refrigeration system is approximately 7,000 pounds.  The Dryer refrigeration system is used to freeze dry fruit and yogurt.  It is a single stage system with two (2) low stage compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the recirculator. \r\n\r\nThe total amount of ammonia onsite, considering the quantities in the Freezer and Dryer ammonia refrigeration systems, is approximately 17,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.

Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \r\n\r\nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed throughout this document Watershed Foods is actively working on improving this program. \r\n\r\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was conducted on June 8 and 9, 2010, and the next audit will occur before June 8 and 9, 2013, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation - Watershed Foods has updated a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information - Watershed Foods maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis - Watershed Foods has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to"

Watershed Foods updated operating procedures for both the Freezer and Dryer refrigeration systems during October and November 2010.  Annually, the operating procedures will be reviewed and certified as accurate.\r\n\u00bf\tTraining - Watershed Foods has updated a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change - Watershed Foods has updated a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. \r\n\u00bf\tPre-Startup Review - Watershed Foods has updated a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity - Watershed Foods has updated a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.

This coordination effort includes providing each aforementioned agency with a copy of our emergency action plan, providing each with a site diagram and hazardous material information.\r\n\r\nAlthough Watershed Foods does not have an onsite hazardous materials response team, selected individuals have received HAZWOPER training through classroom instruction, on-the-job training, and drills.  The current HAZWOPER training includes the first responder awareness level, the first responder operations level, and hazardous materials technician training.  \r\n\r\nThe facility has two (2) windsocks present onsite for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release and evacuation of the building.\r\n\r\nThe current Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia is included in Appendix E. \r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\tEmergency Communications\r\nThe telephone numbers of agencies and plant personnel that may be contacted in case of an emergency are available onsite.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nChemical safety is an important part of Watershed Foods operations.
