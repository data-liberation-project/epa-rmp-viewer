The Clifton Water District (CWD) utilizes liquefied chlorine in the treatment of water for use by the public.  Chlorine is on the list of hazardous chemicals covered by the threshold limits within the CAA.  The requirements presented in the CAA regarding processes that utilize hazardous chemicals identify specific safety precautions regarding handling and storage of the listed hazardous chemicals.  The Clifton Water District has specific release prevention and emergency response procedures in place to help prevent chemical exposure to water treatment personnel as well as the general public, given the life, health and safety hazards associated with liquefied chlorine.  It is the policy of the CWD to strictly adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules, regulations, and safety precautions.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Clifton Water District\u00bfs Board of Directors and Management that the emergency action response plan utilized by the CWD is in compliance with OSHA\u00bfs Employee Emergency and Fire Prevention Plan, 29 CFR Part 1910.38.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the Clifton Fire District and the Grand Junction Fire Department\u00bfs Hazardous Materials Team (HAZMAT) to respond to hazardous chemical releases at the water treatment plant, and to notify all potentially affected neighbors.\n\nFacility Description and Activities\n\nThe Clifton Water District provides domestic potable water to approximately 35,000 customers located in the unincorporated portion of Mesa County, generally referred to as `Clifton\u00bf (roughly the area encompassed from I-70 to the Colorado River and 30 Road to 34.5 Road), along"

The CWD processes water from the Colorado River through conventional water treatment practices as well as additional finish water treatment through a process utilizing membrane technology.\n\nChlorine is delivered in one-ton bulk containers by certified chemical transportation companies to the water treatment plant where it is off-loaded into the detached chlorine storage/feed facility.  The chlorine storage/feed facility is enclosed within a hardened `post-treatment\u00bf chemical structure.  This structure contains individual rooms for container storage, chlorinator feed systems, and the scrubber unit.  All rooms are separated by fire walls and are fire sprinkled.  The chlorine is fed to the treated water as a part of the final disinfection process prior to delivery to the end user.  The feed system utilizes two one-ton containers that are automatically switched from empty to full via the vacuum manifold system.  The system is on a routine monitoring regimen by treatment plant personnel as well as continuous monitoring by the treatment plant\u00bfs secure SCADA system.  In the event of a leak, the SCADA system automatically shuts down the chlorine feed system, activates the scrubber, and notifies personnel, either via the onsite alarm system or the off-normal hour auto dialer.\n\nAccess to the water treatment plant facility is controlled via locked automatic gates and security fencing surrounding the facility.  The post-treatment chemical feed structure is locked and alarmed at all times to prevent unauthorized access.  All treatment plant personnel are thoroughly trained regarding the hazards and risks associated with chlorine for both themselves and the general public.

The original water treatment plant was constructed in 1979 to all applicable codes and building requirements in force at that time.  The plant underwent expansion in 1981 and again in 1997.  Each time the plant was expanded, all applicable codes and requirements were followed and recommended chlorine handling modifications were implemented.  In 1999, the District identified the need for a revamped chlorine handling and feed facility.  This new facility was placed in service in December 2004.  Final project acceptance was completed in May 2005.  The new system equipment and components related to receiving, feed process and final discharge of chlorine are inspected daily by trained plant personnel and maintained and serviced according to equipment manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations.  The water treatment personnel have been trained to follow specific operational and maintenance procedures while utilizing the chlorine process.\n\nPlant personnel perform daily checks and inspections of the chlorine handling/storage/feed system.  The new facility has a complete and thorough maintenance schedule system in place.  This system is current with the new facility components installed as a part of the new facility.

If hazards and risks are identified, changes to practice and procedure are implemented as needed.
