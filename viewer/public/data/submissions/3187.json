FCC currently produces two calcium phosphate products that are non-hazardous, dry granular materials. Feed mills blend animal feeds incorporating these products to supplement diet.\n\nFCC also produces 14 different analyses of plant food with varying concentrations of the primary plant nutrients. These products are also non-hazardous, non-flammable and will not burn or explode. Lawn and garden markets, as well as, commercial agriculture utilizes FCC's plant food products.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, a plant food ingredient, is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nFCC's ammonia receiving storage tanks and piping to the plant food mixing equipment constitute the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management Regulation.\n\nThere are five ammonia storage tanks. Three tanks were installed in 1954 and two were installed in 1962. Each tank has a capacity of 60 tons of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nIt is the committment of FCC management and employees to prevent any releases from the FCC Plant. In preservation of the safety of our employees, the Plant, and the general public, we commit to the following:\n\n     - A highly trained and well-informed employee group. Employees attend training monthly on topics of safety and operations.\n\n     - Plant equipment maintained and operated according to manufacturer recommendations. A regular schedule of preventive maintenance and inspections is in pl"

Elements of the Plan focus on being prepared for immediate response to any accidental release.\n\nFCC management places a high priority on adhering to the OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, \"Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals\". The policies and procedures, developed to comply with the Standard, address all aspects of Plant activities. They include training, maintenance, operating procedures, process reviews, maintenance and updating of critical  information, safe work practices, incident investigation, auditing, and other activities. The ultimate goal of the previously listed policies and procedures is to provide controls to prevent errors, failures, and inadvertent changes in a process that could result in accidents.\n\nThroughout our 46 years of operation FCC has addressed the elements of accident prevention briefly outlined below:\n\n- Employee Participation -- Employees participate in all aspects of the safety program, for example, process reviews, development of procedures and incident investigation. Employees receive information developed in the program.\n\n- Process Safety Information -- All process information and records including information on the hazards of the chemicals, process technology including safe operating limits, equipment design requirements and equipment inspection records are up-to-date.\n\n- Process Hazards Analysis -- Employee teams conducted a process hazards analysis and a follow-up review to identify and correct perceived hazards. A regular schedule of reviews is in place; however, a process or procedural change would also prompt a review.\n\n- Operating Procedures -- Operating procedures are in place"

These procedures include emergency operation and shutdown, safety system operation and function, as well as, operating limits and methods to correct or avoid deviations from limits, and safety and health considerations.\n\n- Operator Training -- Experienced operators will work beside new operators to familiarize them with the process and train them in operating procedures. Section and Utility Operators receive refresher training in their job responsibilities at three year intervals. Operators, involved in the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia, receive refresher training at two year intervals as required by the Department of Transportation.\n\n- Contractors -- Contractor selection includes a review of their safety performance and programs. Contractors receive orientation of facility hazards, and the Emergency Response Plan before they begin work. Contractor employees must adhere to facility safe work practices. Contractor performance is subject to periodic evaluation to assure safe and correct work practices.\n\n- Pre-startup Safety Review -- New process equipment and any significant Plant modifications are subject to a safety review before being placed in operation. The purpose of a safety review is to assure that construction and installations are in accordance with applicable design parameters and specifications. Also to insure that all necessary procedures, including safety procedures, are in place; training is complete, and that a Hazards Analysis or the requirements of a Management of Change are complete.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity -- The mechanical integrity program utilizes guidelines of regulatory agencies and the recommendations of equipment manufacturers. Procedures are in place for inspection, testing and correction of any equipment deficiencies. A quality assurance procedure insures equipment, parts, materials, and installations are suitable for the applications intended.\n\n- Safe Work Practices -- Safe Work Practic"

The review addresses safety impact, technical applications, required procedure modifications, and training. The Management of Change procedure is in place to address the safety of the change and to prevent undesirable consequences as a result of change.\n\n- Incident Investigation -- A Plant employee team will promptly investigate any incident that resulted in or could have resulted in a release. Findings of the investigation, recommendations for corrective action, as well as, the resulting action will become part of the documented investigation.\n\n- Emergency Planning and Response -- FCC's Emergency Response Plan and Process Safety Management Manual have been reviewed. Elements required by OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals\" and EPA's Risk Management Plan are in place and up to date.\n\n- Compliance Audit -- Persons knowledgeable of facility processes have audited FCC's Process Safety Management Program at three year intervals to verify the accuracy of the previously listed activities. Documentation of audits is available as are corrections of deficiencies.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThe FCC Plant has a written Emergency Response Plan as required by EPA's Risk Management Plan, OSHA, and other regulatory agencies. The State Emergency Response Commission, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other appropriate local response agencies received FCC's Emergency Response Plan and Community Right-to-Know information.\n\nFCC is an active participant in the Local Emergency Planning Committee and interacts with various local emergency response agencies in emergency planning.\n\nWorst-Case Rele"

The worst case and alternate case scenarios would have off-site impact. The DEGADIS modeling system determined the extent of the worst case and alternate case scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario focuses upon the largest single quantity of anhydrous ammonia contained in one vessel at a facility. At FCC that vessel would be a railroad tank car. The established industry standard guideline, an administrative control, regulates the contents of ammonia cars at about 77 tons. This scenario assumes release of the entire 77 tons as a gas in a 10 minute period.\n\nShould a release occur it is improbable that it could go to vapor in 10 minutes since a large quantity of heat would be required for vaporization.\n\nRailroad tank cars are subject to strict federally regulated inspections and must meet high standards. Should there be a complete failure of excess flow valves in the tank car's normal outlets, it would be impossible for a tank car to completely unload in a 10 minute period.\n\nThe alternate case scenario focuses upon a more likely set of parameters. A release event would be more likely to occur in the unloading of a rail car. A two inch hose, which is specifically designed for this service, connects the rail cars to unloading lines. This scenario assumes that the two inch hose ruptures. Three levels of check and excess flow valves as well as two levels of operator intervention make up a system of safeguards designed to prevent and limit a release.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nIn its more than 45 years of operation, FCC has not had a release with off-site impact.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\nSafety reviews and improvements are ongoing at FCC.
