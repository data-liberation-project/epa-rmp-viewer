      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction \n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  We at the Riverside Regional Water Quality Control Plant (Riverside RWQCP) use chemicals, too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe water discharges to the environment or for landscaping or irrigation uses, and we use sulfur dioxide to remove excess chlorine in a final polishing stage of treatment.  We re-use digester gas (mostly methane in composition), which is produced during the breakdown of solids, to fuel our boilers and our emergency power supply (cogeneration system).  Storing large quantities of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and digester gas can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using these chemicals as seriously as we take providing the environment safe, disinfected water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure safety, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Riverside Public Works Department and Riverside RWQCP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  These two City activities adhere to all applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 ? of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, "

      "SummaryText": "Chapter 4.5.  These regulations require facilities storing large quantities of certain chemicals like chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and digester gas to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Riverside RWQCP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers and a dechlorination system that uses sulfur dioxide gas fed from liquid sulfur dioxide containers.  During the wastewater treatment process, sludge degradation produces digester gas that is composed mainly of methane and is used to fuel process boilers and the emergency power supply (cogeneration system).  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal response team policies and procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, or digester gas to the environment.  The Riverside RWQCP has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.  In over 55 years of operation, Riverside RWQCP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Riverside WQCP, operating since 1948, is located at 5950 Acorn Street in the City of Riverside in Riverside County.  The plant, located on a 122-acre property is about 3 miles north of the Van Buren exit of the 91 Freeway.  Wastewater from the service area is treated at the Riverside RWQCP and final clean and disinfected water is either discharged into the Santa Ana River or pumped to customers as reclaimed water for landscaping and irrigation uses.  This wastewater treatment includes preliminary treatment, primary and secondary treatment, flow equalization, coagulation/filtration, and chlorination and dechlorination before final discharge or reclamation use.  The Riverside RWQCP handles wastewater flows up to 40 million gallons per day (MGD), with an average flow of 32 MGD.\n\nRiverside RWQCP currently stores chlorine, sulfur dioxide, "

Sulfur dioxide is stored in two, 25-ton bulk storage tanks. Approximately 32,000 lbs of digester gas is stored in the headspace of four active digesters, and is used for fuel for the digester system boilers and for the emergency power supply (cogeneration system). Federal RMP and CalARP regulations require RMPs for facilities that store more than 2,500 lbs of chlorine, 5,000 lbs of sulfur dioxide, or 10,000 lbs of digester gas (mostly methane).  Both liquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide are brought to the plant and transferred to the bulk storage tanks.  Either liquid or gaseous chlorine and sulfur dioxide can be withdrawn from the tanks.\n\n\nFacility Safety Systems\n\nThe chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and digester gas processes at Riverside RWQCP are equipped with numerous safety devices and systems.  Some of these safeguards are described below.\n\nEntry to the Riverside RWQCP is controlled at Acorn Street by a gate and phone security system.  From 6 a.m. until 6 p.m., the gates are open and the plant is accessible.  From 6 p.m. until 6 a.m., after normal working hours, visitors and contractors must dial the control building and be approved by Riverside RWQCP staff prior to entry into the facility. \n\nThe Riverside RWQCP is equipped with three wall-mounted chlorine leak detectors.  During an alarm condition, the detectors will activate a red alarm light within the detector and one alarm signal at the chlorine control panel.  The detector will also activate a blue flashing light and audible alarm, and will page the senior operator.  The warning level setpoint is 1 ppm, and the alarm level setpoint is 3 ppm of chlorine for all leak detectors.  A shutoff and pressure-reducing valve is located on the discharge of the chlorine evaporator.  The valve prevents liquid chlorine from reaching the gas piping system.

Pressure relief valves and vacuum regulating check valves are located throughout the chlorination system to prevent a pressure buildup in the gas or liquid pipelines.  \n\nThree sulfur dioxide leak detectors are provided for the dechlorination system. An alarm light on the face of the sulfur dioxide leak detector flashes when sulfur dioxide gas in excess of 1 ppm is detected.   The detector will also activate a blue flashing light and audible alarm, and will page the senior operator.  An emergency alarm annunciates at the Operation Interface Station if any of the following are detected:  storage area SO2 leak, sulfur dioxide feed room SO2 leak, bulk storage tank expansion chamber high pressure (1 and 2), SO2 gas relief high pressure (each evaporator), or evaporator high water bath temperature (each evaporator).  Numerous other warning alarms are included throughout the sulfur dioxide system to ensure worker safety and to protect equipment.  The sulfur dioxide system at Riverside RWQCP is equipped with expansion chambers in the liquid lines, and vacuum regulating check valves in the gas lines to prevent a pressure buildup in the gas or liquid pipelines.  \n\nThe digester gas system at the Riverside RWQCP is equipped with a safety control system that has a flame-sensing relay and programmer-controlled ignition to start and stop the burner in the event of ignition pilot or flame failure.  Automatic spark ignition for the pilot, and automatic restart after a power failure or interruption in fuel supply, is provided.

Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.  This information is contained in Section 2 of the Process Safety Management Plan.\n\nWe also have scheduled reviews of our risk management program and process safety management plan to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn June 2004, a process hazard analysis  (PHA) update was conducted with plant staff, engineering, and administrative staff for the regulated processes.  The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and engineers.  The PHA technique used was the \"What-If\" investigation method, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The PHA was lead by a knowledgeable person on the type of process being reviewed.  This review will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of actions to resolve any significant hazard review findings was prepared and staff is currently working to resolve this action item list.  Staff will document completion of each action item.\n\nA seismic walkthrough was previously completed in 1999, and recommendations were provided to Riverside RWQCP for their evaluations and implementation.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nRiverside RWQCP maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the chlorine, sulfur dioxide and digester gas processes.  Riverside RWQCP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard operating procedures ("

Procedures include startup, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operation.  Also included are maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to avoid deviations.  Riverside RWQCP will update procedures whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Operating procedures will be developed and in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or a changed process starting back up.\n\n\nOperations and Maintenance Training Program\n\nEach Riverside RWQCP employee presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine, sulfur dioxide and digester gas processes is trained in an overview of the process and detailed, applicable operating and maintenance procedures.  This training helps employees understand the nature and cause of problems arising from operations involving chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and digester gas, and increase employee awareness of their hazards. Riverside RWQCP's training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers 1) a general overview of the processes, 2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and 3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Observation has been used in the past and oral reviews and written self-evaluations are planned to be used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the process work can be resumed. \n\nTraining documentation includes: date of most recent review or revision to the training program, type of training required and the type of competency testing used to ensure staff understands the training, and an on-going employee training record.\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Riverside RWQCP has procedures and policies in place that ensure that only contractors with good safety prog"

This program includes an emergency action and notification plan.  Emergency operation and action procedures are also reviewed once per year.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Riverside RWQCP has conducted feasibility studies to investigate alternative disinfection processes such as ultraviolet oxidation, and alternative, less hazardous chemicals such as sodium hypochlorite or sodium bisulfite.  Transition to the latter is planned to be completed by June 2005."
