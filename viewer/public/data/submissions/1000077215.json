This commitment is integral to the effectiveness of the site-specific programs and policies developed to prevent an accidental release of hazardous materials. Accident release prevention has been established through the development and implementation of design and installation specifications, operating procedures, maintenance programs, employee training, and continuous improvement practices. The purpose of an accidental release prevention effort is to prevent the occurrence of a highly hazardous chemical incident or to minimize the potential consequences of an accidental release. In the event of a highly hazardous chemical incident or emergency, employees, visitors, and contractors are trained to act according to the site-specific Emergency Action Plan. \n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nVirginia Poultry Growers Cooperative, Inc. located at 6349 Rawley Pike, Hinton, Virginia 22831, is a poultry processing and storage facility, operating as VPGC, LLC. For this facility, the Risk Management Program (\"RMP\") regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is utilized as a refrigerant for the closed-loop mechanical refrigeration systems. The closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration systems provide process cooling and refrigerated warehouse storage capabilities to maintain product quality. Ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, reliable, and efficient refrigerant, though, because of moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical.\n\n\n\nDue to the operating inventories of the ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") applicability, this facility is covered under Program Level Three [3] requirements of the RMP r"

However, for the purpose of RMP, VPGC, LLC manages the systems as one covered process.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative-Case Release Scenario(s)\n\n\n\nVPGC, LLC has conducted a comprehensive Hazard Assessment for the Hinton, VA facility to determine and document the Offsite Consequence Analysis (\"OCA\") of potential worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration systems. The OCA describes the offsite exposure to surrounding areas, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities from an accidental release based on the site-specific administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each determined scenario.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nVPGC, LLC has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements established by 40 CFR Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119 through the development of a combined Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program for the two [2] ammonia refrigeration systems operating at the Hinton, VA facility. \n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program consists of fourteen base elements, which work together to establish an incident-free culture. These elements include of policies and procedures for Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permits, Contractors, Emergency Planning and Response, and Trade Secrets.

Information collection enables employers and employees to identify, understand, and plan for the hazards posed by the ammonia refrigeration system to improve processes, process safety, and emergency response. The compiled information shall be used for many purposes, such as developing procedures and training programs. The site-specific information is used as a resource to support the Process Hazard Analysis (\"PHA\") studies.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis element provides the guidelines for completing comprehensive studies of the ammonia refrigeration system to ensure that potential hazards are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations and are re-evaluated at a minimum of every five [5] years. Any corrective actions required as a result of these studies will be undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Operating Procedures element provides the guidelines and written procedures for safely conducting activities related to the ammonia refrigeration systems. These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup, normal startup, normal operations, emergency operations, temporary operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following an emergency shutdown or turn around. The information is regularly reviewed for accuracy and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe T"

Refresher training is provided at least every three [3] years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity element provides the guidelines and written procedures for maintaining, inspecting, and testing the ammonia refrigeration system equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in the applicable maintenance practices.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Management of Change element provides guidelines for managing changes, including replacements-in-kind, in ammonia refrigeration system technology, equipment, and procedures. Authorized employees whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia refrigeration system modification are promptly made aware of and offered training for the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Pre-Startup Safety Review element provides the guidelines for reviewing startup safety any time the ammonia refrigeration system or any of its components, are opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Compliance Audit element provides the guidelines for conducting audits of the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the Federal and, as applicable, State regulations, are implemented.
