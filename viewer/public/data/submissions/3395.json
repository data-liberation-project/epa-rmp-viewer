RD. 2 & HWY. 23\nRUSSELL, MN. 56169         \n\nFor futher information contact: Gary Erdmann, General Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.   The Facility Policy\n\n       The owners, management, and employees of Southwestern MN. Dairy Ass'n are committed to the \nprevention of any accidential release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.   Facility Information.\n\n      The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production\nnutrients. The maximum quantity stored would be 220,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon tank plus nineteen 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck holding 42,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release senario.\n\n     The worse-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage\ntank, released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 132,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles. The alternate release scenario, based on a 2 minute release from a 3 inch pipe break, is a distance to an endpoint of .78 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrou"

Five Year Accident History\n\n     There have been no acidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage nor to our knowledge have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     The facility has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38, provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA), and coordinated with local authorities.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    No changes to improve safety are planned at this time."
