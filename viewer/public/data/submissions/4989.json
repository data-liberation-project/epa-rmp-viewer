      "SummaryText": "Ravenna Foundry is a division of Ravenna Aluminum, Inc. which manufactures aluminum castings for the automotive industry. The types of automobile parts produced by the Ravenna foundry includes, but is not limited to the following, air intake manifolds, oil filter adapters, deactivator housings, etc.. Parts that are cast are used on the engines of many cars including, but not limited to the following cars: Jeep Grand Cherokee, Chrysler Minivans, Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Camaro and mid-size General Motors Sedans.\n    The Ravenna foundry uses the semi-permanent mold process to produce its castings. The semi-permanent mold process derives its name from the fact that the mold is more or less \"permanent\" but the sand cores are temporary - they can only be used one time. Sand cores are used to form internal passages in the part and are made up of sand and resins that are used to bind the sand together. The process of making the sand cores is called the \"coremaking process\". Important equipment used in the coremaking process includes a mixer, a coremachine and a corebox. The corebox is the mold that's used to form the cores. After the sand and resins are blown into the cavity of the corebox, sulfur dioxide (a catalyst) is blown through the sand and resins which activates the \"curing process\". Curing is the process in which the sand/resin mix changes from a wet, mud-like substance into a solid form. The coremake process utilizes (1) one 2,000-pound cylinder or approximately 165 gallons of sulfur dioxide that moves through piping and into the corebox. Sulfur dioxide enters into the corebox as a gas and exits through vacuum hoses into a scrubber, which neutralizes the sulfur dioxide. The Ravenna foundry stores cylinders of sulfur dioxide inside the building. Depending on the production requirements, as much as 18,000 pounds or 9 cylinders may be stored inside the building at one time. \n    The Ravenna foundry's Risk Management Program describes release scenario's that could possibly"

      "SummaryText": " happen in the event of an emergency. The EPA's RMP *Comp program was used as a guidance in conducting the modeling of the different scenario's that could happen during the course of an emergency. The Ravenna foundry has two processes that deal directly with the sulfur dioxide. Process 1 is the coremake process in which 2,189 pounds of sulfur dioxide is utilized and process 2 is the storage area that has approximately 9 cylinders or 18,000 pounds stored on racks located inside the plant at any given time. In reviewing the worse case scenario for process 1, we looked at what can happen in the event of an emergency that would possibly result in the sudden loss of all sulfur dioxide in this process as a control measure against the accident. The Ravenna foundry has in place an emergency alarm system that would alert trained personnel to a concentrated area of sulfur dioxide. This allows for immediate investigation of a possible hazard. If the hazard is found, an emergency evacuation alarm is sounded which in-turn shuts down the sulfur dioxide system and alerts haz-mat trained individuals of a potential discharge or release. In the event of a cylinder leak, specially trained haz-mat employees can apply a cylinder patch specifically designed for the cylinders to the leak. In reviewing the worse case scenario for process 2, we looked at what can happen if an explosion occurs in the storage area. An explosion is unlikely to happen due to sulfur dioxide being a non-flammable gas and the cylinders are designed to expand if over-pressurized. Fuse plugs are provided to allow a slow release of sulfur dioxide if the temperature is elevated above 165 degrees F.. Mapping is provided in our program that explains the areas outside of our plant that would be required to be evacuated in the event the release would require outside assistance. Alternative releases we reviewed and described in our program as a cylinder leak for both processes. Specially trained haz-mat employees using the"

Haz-mat employees are on an annual retraining program schedule. \n    The Ravenna foundry prevention program complies with the Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) PSM rule and a failure mode and effect analysis was used along with written procedures to comply with the rule and regulation. Trained personnel with a step-by-step check-off sheet closely scrutinize hook up of the sulfur dioxide cylinder to the system. Space aged stainless steel fittings are utilized throughout the system to ensure leak free piping. Employees have been trained to identify potential problems and report the same to management personnel. Haz-mat employees are trained by outside professional services and are certified on an annual basis. We have had no accidental releases at the Ravenna foundry in the past five years. \n    The Ravenna foundry's Emergency Response program describes personnel responsible for the evacuation of the company and the coordination with the local agencies to address leaks or spills of sulfur dioxide. Evacuation will take place as an emergency shutdown alarm is activated and specially trained haz-mat employees are notified of the accident. Outside responders will be notified if the condition of the emergency intensifies to where public notification and evacuation would be necessary. Upon notification to the outside responders, the outside responders would take charge of an emergency.     \n    The sulfur dioxide system is tested and inspected on a routine basis with contact to the original supplier and manufacturer for improvements and updates of the written safety procedures. Management personnel emphasize and take pride in the safety program to ensure the employees and the public is safe from harm."
