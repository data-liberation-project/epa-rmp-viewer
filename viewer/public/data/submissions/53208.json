This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe Hartland 36 Gas Plant, located near Hartland, Michigan, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, including natural gas liquids, and oil from the produced well stream. In addition, the plant operates a variety of refrigeration and support processes which use propane as a refrigerant and natural gas as a supplemental fuel for the flare. The Hartland 36 Gas Plant has several regulated flammable substances from methane through pentane. These compounds may be present in both hydrocarbon mixtures and as essentially pure compounds. There are no regulated toxic substances at the facility. Although hydrogen sulfide is present in the facility it is not present in the concentrations or mass necessary to trigger RMP coverage for H2S as a toxic. \n\nAll of the covered processes in the facility are designated as Program 3 under this Risk Management Plan and handled accordingly. \nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS \n\nToxic Release Scenarios \n\nThere are no regulated Toxic substances at the facility.\nFlammable Release Scenarios \nThe WCS associated with the release of flammable substances at the Hartland 36 Gas Plant is the release of the full Inventory of the NGL storage bullet followed by a vapor cloud explosion. This is an instantaneous release of 212,476 pounds of a mixed NGL product. The EPA's Guidance Refer"

This Information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \nThe Hartland 36 Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \nThe Hartland 36 Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. \nThese periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. On"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \nIn addition, the Hartland 36 Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \nTraining \nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Hartland 36 Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific; duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests. skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an accep"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do In event at an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safely rules, and (8) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) Information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Hartland 36 Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \nThe Hartland 36 Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior 10 placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevent"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \nManagement of Change \n\nThe Hartland 36 Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change, \n\n\nIncident Investigation \nThe Hartland 36 Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
