During this time we have been careful to operate in a safe and considerate manner for the safety of our employees and the general public. We have taken care continually to make needed changes as pointed out by state and/or federal agencies, employees, and our insurers. This has resulted in a safety record which we believe will compare favorably with anyone. We have never had an occurrence with off-site effects. It is our full intent to continue to maintain this safety record. We will continue to make changes in operational procedures, rules, equipment and other means of keeping our people and the public as safe as possible. \n\nSincerely,                                                                                                                                                                  \n\nRicky Duncan, Water Resource Director."
