Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of DEDHAM COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONare committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and \t propane\n If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nanhydrous ammonia\tand \t propane are stored at the facility in 2 storage tanks (XX, 30000 gallons (2),XX,18000 gallons). \n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 204,000  pounds. \n\nPropane is received and stored at the facility for grain drying and heating in one storage tank. The maximum quantity released in a worst case would be 94,400 pounds.\n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 204000  pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.4 miles.  \n\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .8 miles.  \n\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \""
