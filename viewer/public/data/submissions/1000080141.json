The facility is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facility's staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely storing, processing, and extracting natural gas liquids. This is an RMP Program 3 facility.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Belridge Gas Plant has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, the operation, and the maintenance of the Natural Gas Liquid Extraction system.  The Belridge Gas Plant's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility processes natural gas and extracts, stores and transfers propane, butane, and natural gasoline to LPG transport vehicles. There are seven tanks with a total capacity of 370,292 gallons, the largest of which is 68,931 gallons. The storage levels on all seven tanks are administratively controlled not to exceed 90% of each tank's maximum capacity. The Belridge Gas Plant currently uses approximately 1,800,000 lbs of total flammable materials in the tanks and associated equipment. \n\n\n\nThe system is composed of the following key equipment/systems:\n\n-Gas Compression system\n\n-Inlet Gas system\n\n-Refrigeration Compressor system\n\n-Ethylene Glycol system\n\n-Deethanizer system\n\n-Depropanizer system\n\n-Debutanizer system\n"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary:\n\nScenario Description: A realistic flammable alternative release scenario was modeled utilizing a transfer hose failure scenario.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook. \n\n\n\nOff-site Receptors\n\nRMP requirements state that sensitive populations such as schools, hospitals, day-care centers, long-term health care facilities, prisons, residential areas, public use parks/recreational areas, and major commercial facilities, located within the \"at risk\" area must be identified.  These sensitive populations include individuals who could not remove themselves from the exposure area without assistance.  The sensitive populations also include industrial installations which may have a hazardous process that cannot be immediately left unattended. Only major industrial facilities were identified as part of the Hazard Assessments.   \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and extraction of natural gas has inherent potential risks, and a worst-case release scenarios will not reach a community; the Belridge Gas Plant has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions tha"
