This is an RMP Program 3 facility.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Belridge Gas Plant has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, the operation, and the maintenance of the Natural Gas Liquid Extraction system.  The Belridge Gas Plant's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe facility processes natural gas and extracts, stores and transfers propane, butane, and natural gasoline to LPG transport vehicles. There are seven tanks with a total capacity of 370,292 gallons, the largest of which is 68,931 gallons. The storage levels on all seven tanks are administratively controlled not to exceed 90% of each tank's maximum capacity. The Belridge Gas Plant currently uses approximately 1,800,000 lbs of total flammable materials in the tanks and associated equipment. \r\n\r\nThe system is composed of the following key equipment/systems:\r\n-Gas Compression system\r\n-Inlet Gas system\r\n-Refrigeration Compressor system\r\n-Ethylene Glycol system\r\n-Deethanizer system\r\n-Depropanizer system\r\n-Debutanizer system"
