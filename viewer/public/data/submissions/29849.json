Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Meckling Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Clay County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for the purpose.\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point was determined with the EPA RMP Comp Model.  The population was determined by using census information from area maps and community directorates.\n\nThe alternate release scenario:  a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve-valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The distance to the end point was determined the EPA RMP Comp model.\n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is reference in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b)"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia is the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.    Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\nA written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nProvided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\nIf a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n\n\n1.    With-in 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\n\n\nThe National Emergency Response Center @ 800-424-8802\n\n2.    Immediately (within one hour) after determining that the amount of release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will Notify:\n\n\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Environmental and Natural Resources @ 605-773-3296 (day phone) or 605-773-3231 (after hours phone).\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions OF THE FACILITY.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
