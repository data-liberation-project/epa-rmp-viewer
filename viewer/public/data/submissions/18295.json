Facility Policy:  The management and employees of Graymont Coop Association are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with these materials.  Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activities at this facility are the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and propane for sale to customers.  Anhydrous ammonia and propane is received, stored and distributed at this facility.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility is 320000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of propane stored at this facility is 70000 pounds.  This facility stores anhydrous ammonia in 3 tank(s) and propane in 1 tank(s).  \n\n3.  Toxic Worst-Case Scenario:  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the maximum allowed capacity of 85% would release the total contents or 140000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a gas in a period of ten minutes.  Company procedures and equipment design standards limit the maximum filling capacity of tanks to 85% of capacity.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.2 miles.\n\nFlammable Worst-Case Scenario:  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the maximum allowed capacity of 85% at 600 F would release the total contents or 70000 pounds of propane.  Company procedures and equipment design standards limit the maximum filling capacity of tanks to 85% at 600 F.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which finds an ignition source, and 10% of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for the worst-case scenario"
