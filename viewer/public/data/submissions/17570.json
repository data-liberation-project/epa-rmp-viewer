The              \n    facility manufactures fiberglass building insulation which is sold in the commercial,             \n    residential, and retail markets.  The facility currently encompasses approximately                \n    578,500 square feet under roof and is set in 40.6 acres of urban area.  There are presently       \n    about 350 full time employees who operate the Plant 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.              \n                                                                                                      \n    Johns Manville places a strong emphasis on safety and environmental leadership.  The              \n    Company fosters a proactive philosophy to ensure that employees work in a safe                    \n    environment and that each facility remains in full compliance with all applicable federal,        \n    state, county and local regulations.  JM is also committed to environmental leadership            \n    within the community served.  This commitment is exemplified in the Defiance 08                   \n    Facility\u0012s strong recycling and waste minimization programs.  The Company\u0012s long term             \n    goal is to have zero process wastes taken to disposal facilities, with all residual materials     \n    either recycled or used for beneficial purposes.  The Facility demonstrates another               \n    example of its aggressive position on recycling through its use of extraordinarily high           \n    levels of outside, post-consumer glass in its forming process.  This crushed glass, or            \n    \u0013cullet\u0014 would otherwise be deposited in municipal landfi"

Resin solution is stored in cold storage until it is mixed with    \n    water and other materials to make a binder solution (less than 1% formaldehyde) which is          \n    applied to fiberglass.  This binder solution is applied in the fiberglass manufacturing           \n    process as a low VOC binder which acts to bind glass fibers.

The resin storage               \n    processes are designed to minimize spills in the event of an accidental release.  The resin       \n    storage rooms are equipped with trenches that minimize the surface area of a spill.  In           \n    addition, the resin storage rooms are maintained at 50 degrees F to reduce the volatility of      \n    the material.

At Defiance 08, two formaldehyde processes, Resin 89 and             \n    Resin West/Resin East (same process, but different tank locations) are considered.
