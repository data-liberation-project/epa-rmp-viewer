This facility has mechanisms in place as identified in \"Emergency Action Plan\" to address releases of chlorine.  Designated facility personnel have received required OSHA training to respond to a chlorine release.  If an emergency were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThis facility is a producer of sodium hypochlorite solution and a repackager of bulk chlorine.  Chlorine is an intermediate product in the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite.  System 1 - Repackaging Plant has a maximum intended chlorine inventory of 86,000 pounds.  System 2 - Chlor-Alkali Plant has a calculated chlorine inventory of 68 pounds.  A maximum of 200,000 pounds of chlorine may be on site in repackaged containers.  Thus, the total facility capacity is approximately 286,068 pounds of chlorine.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of the chlorine storage tank in system 1 when it has its maximum intended inventory of 86,000 pounds, resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance to a 0.0087 mg/l chlorine toxic endpoint is 9.2 miles and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a 1/4\" effective diameter orifice leak (representative of releases from piping failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seats and drains or bleeds that lead to an airborne release.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site to a distance of 0.2 mile.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMI"

The chlorine systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with Chlorine Institute codes and standards.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have not had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place in the five years prior to December 14, 2001.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our chlorine systems, it is our policy to employ designated facility personnel to respond to the emergency.  Designated response personnel and procedures are identified in written plans entitled \"Emergency Action Plan\" and \"Process Safety Management, Chlorine Systems\".  These personnel have received necessary response operations training in accordance with applicable OSHA regulations.  Designated personnel will also perform required external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Response Comission, Local Emergency Planning Committee).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the chlorine systems."
