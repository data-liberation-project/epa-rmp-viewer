This evaluation service (ISN) and their review, coupled with on-site safety department's periodic WIP and annual evaluations, ensured that contractor safety performance at the Luling Site is maintained at a high level.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nDuring the past 5 years, there have been no RMP-defined accidental release events.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nIn accordance with the revised provisions of the RMP and PSM rules, Bayer's Luling facility has a documented Emergency Response Plan that includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of potential events such as inclement weather, fire, and toxic chemical releases.  Personnel responsible for implementing this procedure are available onsite at all times.  In general, the plan describes actions which result in a safe response for company employees as well as prompt notification of community organizations.  The plan has been integrated with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) and other appropriate organizations. \n\nThe following actions take place in the event of an emergency:\n\n-\tDEP is notified immediately;\n-\tPlant personnel respond immediately; and\n-\tDEP determines possible community impact and takes appropriate action.  These actions could include no action, shelter-in-place, evacuation, or continual communications.  Methods of communicating to the public include a siren system, cable TV or radio broadcasts, a telephone alert system, and door-to-door notifications.\n\nThe Luling plant Emergency Response Team (ERT) provides Fire, HAZMAT, EMS and Rescue Response.  The ERT maintains approximately 70 members and fluctuates with personnel changes over the year.  Emergency response equipment in the plant is routinely inspected and maintained to ensure a state of readiness, and is summarized as follows:\n\nEmergency Vehicles\nAmbulance\nHAZMAT Truck\nFire Truck\nMobile Emergency Control Center\nRescue Truck\nRescue Boat"

Each change is appropriately reviewed by a team of personnel to determine if there is any impact to system safety.\n\n-\tThe site utilizes a number of contract personnel for a variety of services. Our Contractor Management program requires that contractors be selected using their actual safety performance as a criteria, and open communication exists between Bayer and contract employees to identify and control hazards.\n\nIn addition, we utilize a number of systems for specific chemicals.  Examples include:\n\n-\tProcess alarms and interlocks,\n-\tArea monitors to quickly detect leaks,\n-\tWater sprinkler systems to extinguish process fires, and\n-\tExcess flow valves which will stop chlorine flow under certain conditions.\n\nBoth the general and chemical specific systems work together to minimize the frequency and consequences of chemical releases.\n\nPeriodic Compliance Auditing:\nPeriodic compliance auditing is conducted through both the Environmental and Process Safety Management groups.  Auditing that reviews the elements of the RMP program are conducted in both of these programs.  The last full corporate compliance audit was conducted in 2021.  \n\nContractor Safety Evaluations:\nThe Luling Site utilizes an outside company (ISN) to screen, continuously review, and provide safety data to Bayer on all existing and potential contractors and their individual employees.  These evaluations are completed continuously for all contractors within their network; Bayer only uses contractors / vendors that have been screened using this service; and the database is reviewed prior to allowing any new contractors to perform work on-site.  Work-In-Progress (WIP) audits of each contractor regardless of the facility they work for are entered into the ISN database and available to all potential companies that are looking to use this contractor.  Therefore, Bayer can evaluate each contractor and their individual employees on a continuous basis with data from"

Accordingly, the Luling Site employs a comprehensive collection of safety systems to maintain the equipment and work practices utilized in our operation to comply with these rules.  Some examples include:\n\n-\tA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted at a minimum of every 5 years.  This involves a team of experts who review the hazards posed by the chemical, best industry practices for handling the material, and a defined system to identify hazards.  Recommendations for improvement are made, and priority is placed on implementing them in a prompt manner.\n\n-\tOur mechanical integrity system requires regular inspection of the equipment, relief devices, and other systems utilized in handling regulated materials.\n\n-\tInstructions have been developed to provide detailed actions for employees operating the equipment.  These procedures are developed and reviewed with active involvement from operating personnel, and are certified annually.\n\n-\tA change management system is utilized for changes in equi"
