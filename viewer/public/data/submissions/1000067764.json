      "SummaryText": "K-Flex USA is a manufacturer of synthetic rubber, cross-linked polyethylene (XPE), and expanded polyethylene (EPE) insulation materials, including sheets and rolls for piping.  The facility produces elastomeric, closed cell insulation for plumbing, heating/ventilation/air-conditioning (HVAC), commercial/industrial, marine, oil and gas, and solar applications.  The process includes: blending/working, extruding, oven curing, cooling, packaging, cutting, cladding, specialty parts fitting, and warehousing.\n\n\n\nAddition of the EPE process introduced isobutane, which is a regulated flammable substance, at quantities above the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds), thereby, triggering the PSM and Risk Management Program requirements.  EPE is non-crosslinked, closed-cell polyethylene foam made from low density polyethylene (LDPE) resins.  EPE is manufactured using an extrusion process involving injection of a blowing agent to achieve desired closed-cell structure and physical properties.  Raw materials, including LDPE pellets and additives, are loaded into a hopper and processed through a blending/extrusion line, where blowing agent is injected near the head of the extruder.  Liquified isobutane (blowing agent) is injected at high pressure into molten LDPE, along with non-reactive additives, such as talc and pigments, inside an extruder barrel.  The isobutane is emulsified into the plastic and upon exiting a die, the isobutane flashes to vapor, forming cells in the plastic.\n\n\n\nE.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe isobutane injection process (storage tank and transfer pumps and piping to the injection point) has been designed to comply with requirements of National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 (liquefied petroleum gas code).  It is K-Flex policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulatory requirements.  If an emergency were to occur, it is K-Flex policy to notify the Youngsville Fire Department and/or the Franklin"

K-Flex personnel will only respond to minor leaks and not to significant releases involving isobutane.\n\n\n\nE.2    Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nIsobutane blowing agent is stored onsite in liquid form in a single 12,000-gallon, pressurized aboveground storage tank.\n\n\n\nE.3    Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario considered is failure of the 12,000-gallon storage tank when filled to capacity, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The estimated distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi) for the worst-case vapor cloud explosion scenario extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario considered is an accidental release of the entire capacity of the 12,000-gallon storage tank when filled to capacity, resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  The estimated distance to the lower flammability limit for the alternative vapor cloud fire scenario extends offsite into an undeveloped, wooded area to the north and west of the property line; however, public receptors are not within this area.\n\n\n\nE.4    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe covered isobutane blowing agent process complies with the EPA Risk Management Program accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The isobutane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58.\n\n\n\nE.5    Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nK-Flex USA has not had an accident within the past five (5) years involving isobutane which resulted in deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nE.6    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the isobutane system, it is K-Flex policy to notify the Youngsville Fire Department and/or the Franklin County Office of Emergency Services to request local fire dep"
