Agellan requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Agellan corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\n\n\nThe Sarasota Distribution Center is located at 6100 McIntosh Road in the Southwest corner of Sarasota, Florida.  The Distribution Center consists of areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution.\n\n\n\nThe Sarasota Distribution Center has an ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity. The ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in the southwest corner of the building in the southwest corner of the property in the machine or compressor room.  \n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Sarasota Distribution Center process in the Program 3 level.  The Sarasota Distribution Center will use its PSM Program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe Sarasota Distribution Center has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating conditi"

      "SummaryText": "on and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.   The Sarasota Distribution Center also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, are reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the Prevention Program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Sarasota Distribution Center refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff also performed a PHA of this process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, Mechanical Integrity Inspections, Annual Ammonia Inspections and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n\n\n4.

The site also has some internal emergency response capability and is developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Station 11 Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (941) 951-4211.\n\n\n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nNo changes are specifically identified but regular training sessions, Mechanical Integrity Inspections, Annual Ammonia Inspections and Compliance Audits will be conducted.  If shortfalls are noted in the audits/inspections then an action plan will be developed and areas of improvement will be addressed in a timely manner.\n\n"
