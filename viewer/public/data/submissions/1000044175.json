To accomplish this we integrated health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities. This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\r\n\r\nIn the Hexion Inc., Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective. This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations. This policy refers to the facility's Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials. \r\n\r\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThis facility makes formaldehyde solutions, phenol-formaldehyde resins, and urea-formaldehyde resins. The site includes four (4) formaldehyde manufacturing facilities, and three (3) resin reactors. Although the site sells some formaldehyde, it is primarily used on site as a raw material for both types of resins.  Aqua ammonia is used in small amounts as a raw material for both types of resins. It is received in tank trucks and reusable tote bins.\r\n\r\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\n\r\nThis facility has a Process Safety Management Program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations. A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance. This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site"

The Site Leader has overall responsibility for this program.\r\n\r\nProcess stewards are assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units. Their duties include keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit. All employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation.\r\n\r\nEach Process Steward maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program. Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference. By applying the information it contains, their actions will prevent accidental releases.\r\n\r\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.  Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action item database to track the items to completion.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents. For equipment, procedure, and processes changes, a MOC initiates a safety review. This review may include a process hazard analysis. Changes to product formulations initiate a review by a chemist, process engineer, and other appropriate personnel.  Training is performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact. Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change has been made.\r\n\r\nA preventative maintenance program maintains the mechanical integri"

Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed. The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\r\n\r\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases. One important section describes safety measures for welding or other hot work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire. The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance. These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\r\n\r\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices. Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\r\n\r\nIncidents that cause or could cause a release are investigated and recommendations may lead to improvements that are made to prevent recurrence. These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.  The incident investigation system is a computer based system for documenting the incident reviews.\r\n\r\nPeriodically, a safety professional from another Hexion location or from an external consulting firm conducts a comprehensive audit of the safety program. Addressing recommendations from this audit keeps the safety program effective.\r\n \r\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the five (5) year period from June 5, 2009 to June 5, 2014, there were no incidents with a regulated substance that resulted in an event that meets the reporting criteria for a RMP incident.\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains an emergency response plan that discusses the steps to implement if an accidental release occurs.
