      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN R.E. BADGER FILTRATION PLANT\n\n\nThe R.E. Badger Filtration Plant is located at 18535 Aliso Canyon Road, Rancho Santa Fe, California 92067. R.E. Badger Filtration Plant's initial start-up occurred in 1970. The chlorine feed system consists of twenty-four one-ton containers which are the storage vessels for chlorine. A maximum of three tanks are connected on line on each manifold where two manifolds are present. Chlorine gas is first drawn from a container through vacuum regulator to the manifold. Under vacuum, it is drawn through chlorinators to injectors where it is mixed with water for distribution throughout the treatment plant.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nR.E. Badger Filtration Plant senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. The Safety Coordinator administers the Plant's safety and environmental policies. The Safety Coordinator is responsible for various inspections of the Plant's facilites to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs. These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nChlorine and Aqueous Ammonia are the only regulated substances on site.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe R.E. Badger Filtration Plant has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine. Practices and Procedures for proper chlorine handling were obtained from the Chlorine Institute Manual for the Safety Handling in Chlorine. In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system tied to a chlorine sensor "

Badger Filtration Plant does not view flooding as a consideration due to the fact that the facilitiy is on the side of a mountain. Procedures are in place for operators to respond to a release. The R.E. Badger Filtration Plant has a monthly schedule to test and calibrate our chlorine detectors monthly, our Chlorine detectors are Capital Controls and the model number is 1650.\n\nOne of the safety objectives is to identify process hazards and to reduce or eliminate the risk that the hazards pose to employees and/or public. The equipment was designed, and the operating and maintenance procedures are written, with these objectives in mind. Additionally, every effort is being made to comply with CalARP Program 2 Prevention Program, Section 2755.2 requirements. The Hazard Review was conducted on November 7, 2006. A multidisciplinary team was assembled to perform the Hazard Review. The Hazard Review team included personnel familiar with design, operation, and maintenance requirements, and both a facilitator and scribe from Risk Management Professionals, Inc. The primary objectives of the Hazard Review is to review the process equipment and operation: to comply with applicable portions of the CalARP and EPA regulations; to identify potential hazards and operability concerns; and to suggest methods or design improvements that might be implemented to reduce the risk of potential hazards and of a significant release of potentially hazardous material to atmosphere. The major natural hazards identified were earthquake and fire. The major hazards for process equipment was inadvertently opening an ammonia valve in a confined space. To mitigate this a lockout/tagout procedure and confined space entry permit are in place. All operators are trained prior to working alone. The aqueous ammonia storage tank is situated in the tank farm contai"

An alarm is sent to the Master Control Board. The recommendations from the Hazard Review will be in place by 11/07/2007.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince the initial technical study (January 1999-January 2004) , there have been no releases of chlorine or aqueous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity or the California threshold of any release at either Plant. In addition, due to new regulations set forth in 2004 we will forward any information in regards to release of Chlorine or Ammonia at the Plant.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe R.E. Badger Filtration Plant's employees are first responders.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard. Evacuation drills are performed annually. The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.The first response consists of a two person level \"A\" entry, with two man back-up with decontamination suits are used as first responders as prescribed in the Emergency Response Plan. This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations. It is reviewed annually to ensure that the plan is kept current. \n\nFIRST AID MEASURES\n\nInhalation: Take proper precautions to ensure your own safety before attempting rescue ( e.g. wear appropriate protective equipment, use the buddy system). Remove source of contamination or move victim to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, oxygen may be benficial if adminstered by trained personnel, preferably on doctor's advice. Do not allow victim to move about unnecessarily. Symptoms of pulmonary edema can be delayed up to 48 hours after exposure. Apply artificial respiration if victim is not breathing. Ind"

Give Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) if there is no pulse AND no breathing. Obtain medical attention IMMEDIATELY\n\nSkin Contact: Quickly remove victim from source of contamination and flush with lukewarm, gently flowing water for a minimum of 20 minutes. Liquefied Gas: DO NOT attempt to rewarm the affected area on site. DO NOT rub area or apply dry heat. Gently remove clothing or jewelry that may restrict circulation. Carefully cut around clothing that sticks to the skin and remove the rest of the garment. Loosley cover the affected area with a sterile dressing. Do not allow victim to drink alcohol or smoke. Obtain medical attention IMMEDIATELY.\n\nEye Contact: Immediately flush eyes with lukewarm running water for a minimum of twenty minutes. If a burn exists, cover both eyes with a sterile dressing. Liquified Gas: DO NOT attempt to rewarm the affected area on site. DO NOT rub area or apply dry heat. Loosley cover the affected area with a sterile dressing. Do not allow victim to drink alcohol or smoke. Obtain medical attention IMMEDIATELY.\n\nNote to Physicians: Following exposure the patient should be kept under medical review for at least 48 hours as delayed pulmonary edema may occur.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe R.E. Badger Filtration Plant has taken a pro-active approach to emergency response and safety at the Water Treratment Plants. The annual emergency response drills are documented and mitigation measures to improve the Team's response are continuously being reviewed. The R.E. Badger Filtration Plant has implemented all recommendations from the initial technical studies.\n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the District employees. These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all e"
