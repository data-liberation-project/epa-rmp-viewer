ENTRANCE TO THE PLANT IS IN A REMOTE AREA AWAY FROM THE POPULACE.THE PLANT SETS DOWN HILL FROM TOWN WITH THE TERRAIN CONTINUING TO FALL AWAY FROM TOWN. THE CITY UTILIZES CHLORINE GAS AND SULFUR DIOXIDE GAS IN ITS TREATMENT PROCESS. THE 1 TON CONTAINERS THESE GASES ARE CONTAINED IN ARE ASME CODED VESSELS. DURING THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THIS PLANT THE ENGINEERS USED GUIDELINES SET FORTH BY THE NATIONAL CHLORINE INSTITUTE. ALL EXTERNAL PIPING IS PROTECTED FROM ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE BY CHANNEL IRON. THE FEED EQUIPMENT IS DESIGNED TO AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN IF A MAJOR LEAK OCCURS IN THE PIPING. ALL EQUIPMENT IS INSPECTED DAILY. ALL PERSONNEL THAT WORK INSIDE THE PLANT HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AND TRAINING IN THE SAFE HANDLING OF CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE AS WELL AS THE USE OF A SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. EACH EMPLOY IS REQUIREDTO ATTEND A CLASS ON HOW TO READ AND INTERPRET A MSDS SHEET WITHIN THEIR FOIRST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE. AS A FIRST RESPONDER EACH HAS BEEN TRAINED IN THE PROPER PROCEDURE TO SHUT DOWN CHEMICAL FEED SYSTEMS, OR REPORT TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL. THE ATHENS FIRE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WRITING ALL EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES, AND COORDINATES ALL EMERGENCY RESPONSES. A COPY OF THE CITY'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE HENDERSON COUNTY EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATOR'S OFFICE. ALL THOUGH A PORTION OF TOWN WOULD BE AFFECTED IF THE WORSE CASE SCENARIO AS DESCRIBED BY THE EPA WERE TO OCCUR, THE PROBABILITY OF SUCH AN OCCURRENCE IS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE. DUE TO THE SAFE GUARDS BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM, THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE GAS, THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND TERRAIN AROUND THE PLANT'S LOCATION ANY RELEASE OF ANY AMOUNTS OF GAS CAPABLE OF HAVING ANY OFF SITE CONSEQUENCE IS UNLIKELY. THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY OFF SITE INCIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS PLANT. "
