The facility will be operated in compliance with the requirements of the National Fire Protection Association(NFPA)-58, Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage, United States Department of transportation(USDOT) 49 CFR 174, and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws.   The EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities is organized into 9 sections. Since this facility only has flammable and no toxic chemicals covered under 40 CFR 68, and because it is a program 3 Propane Storage facility.\n\n\n\nThe Ray Terminals facility is a rail access bulk terminal storage propane(LPG) for resale to retail propane outlets. The facility consists of four (4) 60,000-gallon tanks with a total capacity of 211,200 gallons at maximum fill level (88 %).  The storage tanks are filled by transfers from rail cars.  The facility will have three part-time employees that will be on site during all fuel transfers.  A site plan has been included for reference. \n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies at facility:  Ray Terminals complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes, and regulations. The propane storage and transfer equipment was designed, installed, and is maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and applicable state laws and rules. Protective measures include but are not limited to emergency valves on all inlet and outlet piping, breakaway fittings, at all cargo truck loading areas, emergency relief valves, impact protection measures for all loading and loading areas, and lighting and fencing for security.\n\n\n\nWorst case release scenario: The worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a 60,000 gallon when filled to the greatest extent allowed (88%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.
