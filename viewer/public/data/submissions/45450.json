      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nUAP Distribution, Inc.\n3 Miles West Highway 24\nHoxie, KS\n\nUpdated 3/30/2006 to provide revised corporation information, as well as to include new required RMP information.  As of 2/9/2006, UAP Distribution, Inc., is the owner of this facility.  Mr. Jim Rogers is now an employee of UAP, and agreed to act as emergency response contact until submission of this revised plan.  Mr. Dan Niblock will act as the new emergency contact and is the operations manager of this facility.  \n\nFor more information regarding this plan, contact Dale Buxman, ERS Area Manager, 5701 Eureka Bend, McKinney, TX 75070 (972) 489-3154, or; Dan Niblock, UAP, 3 Miles West Highway 24, Hoxie, KS (785) 675-3354.\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\na) The owners, management and employees of UAP Distribution, Inc. are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nA) This facility has been owned and operated by UAP Distribition, Inc. since February, 2006.  The maximum quantity stored would be approximately 317,000 pounds based on filling storage and nurse tanks to the designed capacity of 85%\n\nB) The primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia, is the storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonia to farmers as a crop nutrient.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nA) The worst-case scenario is based on the entire contents of the storage tanks being released over a 10 minute period.  The quantity released would equal approximately 130,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest tank filled to 85% capacacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\n"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 45450,
      "SummaryText": "B) The alternate-case scenario is based on a release caused by a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity release would be approximately 12,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA) This facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI publication K-61.1, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nB) This facility is in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nC) This facility follows the Anhydrous Ammonia Standards enforced by the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and is inspected by them on a regular basis.\n\nD) The facility is inspected on at least a monthly basis by employees knowledgable in the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nA) There have been no accidents in the previous five years involving the release of anhydrous ammonia at this facility, including the time while operated as Sunflower Chemical, Inc.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nA) This facility has an emergency response plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nB) This facility has provided State and Local Agencies the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nC) This facility has a written emergency response plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120, which includes pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safety conditions, as well as to evaluate employee safety training programs.  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations or improvements planned to be made at this time."
