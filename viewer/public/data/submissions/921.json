The Facility Policy\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any other chemical that is stored at this facility. The Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries \" AG-21\" member, which at this point in time one of three in the State of Kansas. AG-21 is a program that is Enviromental Driven. The Coop goes above and beyond industry standards for the safety of customers, employees, and the enviroment.\n2. Facility Information\nThe NH3 facility is located directly east of the city limits. The facility has two storage tanks of 30,000 and 18,000 gallons which give a total capicity of 48,000 gallons.\n3.The Worst Case Release and Alternate Release Scenario\nWorst case scenario would release 224,313 pounds in a 10 minute period or 22,431 per minute with a 5 mile to end point. Alternate release could involve over filling, this could travel 0.1 mile. The figures  in the alternate release are expressed as estimates.\n4.Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Coop recognize all safety procedures required by State and Federal Regulations. The Coop also complies with recomendations from Farmland's AG-21 policies and general industry standards. The most comon accidental release would be the over filling of nurse trailers. An example would be if the trailer would be filled to 85-90% on a cool morning, as the air temperature rises,  the product expands and causes the  pressure relief valve to let product escape. Our policy is not to fill above 86%. \n5.Five Year Accidient History\nThe Coop has not had a major accidient release withen the past five years.\n6.Emergency Response Program\nThe Coop has an Emergency Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan, and Employee Safety Comittee. All ares have worked with the County, City, and Insurance Companiy Loss Control Departmen  for the developement of these plans.\n7.Planned Safety Changes\nThe Company Saf"
