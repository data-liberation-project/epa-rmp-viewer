The system is checked on a regular basis to ensure it is functioning properly and in good repair.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed by facility personnel, the decision to evacuate the building is made by management.  Professional emergency responders are called to assist with the ammonia leak as necessary. \n\n\n\nThe management at Eckert Cold Storage is committed to safety.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at 757 Moffat Boulevard in Manteca, California was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 12,000 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler and freezer storage. The majority of the system is located in the engine rooms including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the condenser platform located outside the engine rooms, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage areas.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHE"

      "SummaryText": "MICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Eckert Cold Storage ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary repairs in house.\n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine rooms as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine rooms and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped and vent to atmosphere. In addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Eckert Cold Storage has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: \n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\" \n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history during the PHA Revalidation study performed on April 4, 2019, revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia over the past five years (April 2014 - April 2019) that exceeded the Federal "

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a release of ammonia, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Eckert Cold Storage facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) has been developed by Eckert Cold Storage and is included in the PSM/RMP/CalARP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Eckert Cold Storage facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated incident commander for the facility and the maintenance department at a minimum.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\nEckert Cold Storage is non-responding and the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis study (performed on July 1996, and revalidated on July 2004, April 30, 2009, April 15, 2014, and on April 4, 2019), including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Eckert Cold Storage facility located at 757 Moffat Blvd. in Manteca, California.
