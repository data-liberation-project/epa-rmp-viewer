To meet this commitment, it has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this plant.  One component of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using hazardous substances at our plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the RMP at the Chouteau Power Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our RMP.  Section 2 of this executive summary describes the one substance currently used at the Chouteau Power Plant in sufficient quantity to be regulated by the RMP rule.\n\nThe Chouteau Power Plant risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment designed to inform of (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see Sections 3 and 5 of this executive summary\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule - see Section 4 of this executive summary\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see Section 6 of this executive summary\n\nAlthough the RMPlan helps ensure that our plant is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safet"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\n\nAlthough Chouteau Power Plant personnel will not respond to significant releases of ammonia, we have established a written emergency response program to help facilitate the evacuation of our employees and to ensure the safety of outside emergency responders who could be called on to respond to any accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n\u00b7 Informing local emergency responders about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n\u00b7 Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous substances\n\u00b7 Obtaining outside assistance to control and contain accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\n\u00b7 Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n\u00b7 Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\n\n We have trained our employees to recognize and report emergency situations.  All of our personnel and contractors are trained in evacuation procedures.  The LEPC is responsible for notifying the public of the emergency situation, if necessary.\n\n The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations [e.g., the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.38(a)], and a copy of the plan has been provided to the local fire department. Also, a hazardous material inventory has been provided to the LEPC and local fire department, as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act.

We ensure that this process safety information is available to our employees.\n\n2. Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update a process hazard analysis of our anhydrous ammonia process to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that will improve the safe operation of the process.  A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of the anhydrous ammonia process.  This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the anhydrous ammonia system. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to plant personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the system are implemented.  This analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n3. Operating procedures.  Our engineers, operators, and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to ammonia system operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n\u00b7 Steps for safely conducting activities\n\u00b7 Applicable safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of deviations\n\u00b7 Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\n\n4.

Oral reviews and demonstrations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can work on the ammonia system.\n\n5. Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our ammonia handling equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our process.\n\n6. Management of change.  We have a written procedure to review and approve all proposed changes to the ammonia system, including chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n7.

One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment.  We have a program to perform compliance audits of our ammonia system every 3 years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the process.  This audit is performed by an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the ammonia system.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n9. Incident investigation.  We have a program to investigate any incidents or near misses that could reasonably result in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We communicate to our employees the requirement to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  In the event of an incident, an investigation team would be assembled, and the investigation would be initiated as soon as possible, but always within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n10. Employee participation.

      "SummaryText": ".  We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our plant.  We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices orientation.\n\n12. Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities related to the ammonia system are performed in a safe manner.  We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures.  Contractors are required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at our plant.  We routinely verify that this training has been provided. \n\n4.2  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is delivered in tank trucks that must be approved by the Department of Transportation. The anhydrous ammonia storage tanks and equipment are designed and maintained to standards established by the federal government and by industry.  Manual shutoff valves, excess flow devices in the storage tank, and ammonia detectors with alarms are provided as process controls that are in place to help prevent or mitigate releases of anhydrous ammonia from the system.\n\n5.
