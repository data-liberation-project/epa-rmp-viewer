At Vapco, pentane falls under the RMP Program 2 prevention program \r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the pentane prevention program that are key:\r\n\r\n1. \tOnly small amounts of pentane are maintained in the production area, reducing the amount of pentane that could be released at any given time due to improper handling or accidents. \r\n2. \tPentane-containing products are separated across the facility to reduce the amount of pentane that could be released at any given time due to improper handling or accidents.\r\n3. \tThe plant maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe review of the facility's accident history includes the following range of dates:  April 2, 2015 - April 2, 2020. According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\r\n\r\n5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an EACP to address all type of emergencies which could occur at the facility.  The plan includes key management personnel and their roles along with critical phone numbers.  Each type of emergency identified lists actions to be taken along with evacuation procedures.  The Valley Park Fire District will be contacted as needed.  If an ambulance is called, the fire department will also respond.\r\n\r\n6.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe facility plans to store the pentane in several locations, thus reducing the amount of material at risk at any given time for an accident."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Vapco Products, Inc. (Vapco) facility has a thorough process training program to reduce the risk of accidental releases and emergencies.  Should a release or emergency occur, Vapco has developed a thorough Emergency Action and Contingency Plan (EACP) as well as coordination with outside agencies, such as the Valley Parke Fire District, to ensure there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nAt this location, Vapco manufactures an adhesive product by introducing a propane/butane gas mixture into a client-provided product containing pentane.  The NAICS code for the primary process at the facility is 325510.\r\n\r\nVapco has one regulated substances under 40 CFR 68:  pentane (CAS No. 109-66-0) contained in the client-provided product and then in the final adhesive produced by Vapco.  \r\n\r\nThe pentane threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of client-provided and Vapco-produced product onsite is 82,000 pounds.  Per the Safety Data Sheet for the materials, the percentage of pentane contained in these products is 20%.  Therefore, the total quantity of pentane stored on-site is approximately 16,400 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to the Vapco plant in Valley Park, MO.\r\n\r\nAppendix C of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) allows smaller businesses, such as Vapco, to disperse inventory of highly hazardous chemicals onsite to reduce the amount of chemical to less than 10,000 pounds in any given area, provided that a release in one location will not impact the other locations.  To meet this exemption, Vapco has segregated the client-provided products and the final product into groups that contain less than 10,000 pounds spread across the facility such that a release in one location will not impact others in the facility.\r\n\r\n3.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTA"
