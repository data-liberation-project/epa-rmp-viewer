The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nDOT Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility who will respond to minor leaks.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe DOT Foods ammonia refrigeration system was built in 1990.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 1120 W. North St., Vidalia, Georgia 30474.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 16,000 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers and the Thermosyphon Receiver are mounted on the roof above the machine room.  Evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 13,100 pounds in 10 minutes.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stabil"

The reference table, Exhibit 4-4, from the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration for rural topography was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A release of ammonia gas from a 1/4 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 100 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.The reference table, Exhibit 4-5, from the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration for rural topography was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DOT Foods facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room or outside on the roof above the machine room (condensers and Thermosyphon Receiver).\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nThere are ammonia and temperature sensors placed in strategic locations in the freezer, cooler, and dock areas.  In the event of ammonia detection, a facility alarm sounds and"

These sensors are tied to a central computer that alarms and calls an outside alarm company.  The alarm will activate at one set concentration level.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere is no accident history at this facility which commenced operation in 1990.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe DOT Foods has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  Two operators at the facility are trained to use SCBAs and will respond to minor leaks by shutting down the system and ventilating the machine room.  DOT Foods, Vidalia will also call 911 in order for reach the Fire Department who will also respond to the release.  DOT Foods emergency plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis conducted on 11/9/98 provided recommendations to improve safety at the DOT Foods facility located at 1120 W. North St., Vidalia, Georgia.  The latest recommendation is scheduled to be complete by 8/1/99.\n\nR01 Install an emergency switch outside of the machine room to shut down the system.\n\nR02 Establish a sensor concentration level to shut down the machine room.  A suggestion is to have a visual and audible alarm set at half the immediately dangerous to life or health value (150 ppm), or a level that will shut down the compressors.  The ventilation fans should also respond to this concentration level.\n\nR03 Train two people to use SCBAs and respond to minor"
