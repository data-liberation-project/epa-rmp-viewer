The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nDOT Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility who will respond to minor leaks.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe DOT Foods ammonia refrigeration system was built in 1990.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 1120 W. North St., Vidalia, Georgia 30474.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 16,000 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers and the Thermosyphon Receiver are mounted on the roof above the machine room.  Evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 13,100 pounds in 10 minutes.

Two operators at the facility are trained to use SCBAs and will respond to minor leaks by shutting down the system and ventilating the machine room.  DOT Foods, Vidalia will also call 911 in order for reach the Fire Department who will also respond to the release.

The latest recommendation is scheduled to be complete by 8/1/99.\n\nR01 Install an emergency switch outside of the machine room to shut down the system.\n\nR02 Establish a sensor concentration level to shut down the machine room.  A suggestion is to have a visual and audible alarm set at half the immediately dangerous to life or health value (150 ppm), or a level that will shut down the compressors.  The ventilation fans should also respond to this concentration level.\n\nR03 Train two people to use SCBAs and respond to minor"
