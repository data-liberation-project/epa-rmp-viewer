Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nOrtec, Inc. is strongly dedicated to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment to safety starts with our senior management staff and filters down throughout our entire organization. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with regulated processes at our facility.  \n\n\n\nII. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOrtec, Inc. is a custom chemical manufacturer.  Our primary business includes various adhesives, coating polymers, and similar polymers.  We presently have two regulated toxic substances present at our facility.  These substances are Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile] and Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester].  Both monomers are used to make our polymers.\n\n\n\nBoth Acrylonitrile and Vinyl acetate are stored in a bulk storage tanks. \n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we used the EPA's RMP*Comp. \n\n\n\n\n\nIII. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined in 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA regulations.  Our facility also meets the requirements of the OSHA PSM rule.  For Acrylonitrile, a pre-startup review was conducted along with specific training by the supplier on the handling of Acrylonitrile.  All of our affected employees are trained yearly on the hazards associated with Acrylonitrile and safe handling practices.  The Vinyl acetate tank process was reviewed using a process hazard checklist analysis.  Employees were trained on the unloading procedures for both Acrylonitrile and Vinyl"

Only designated employees are qualified to unload Acrylonitrile or Vinyl acetate monomer into the respective bulk storage tank.  \n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nOrtec, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.  We maintain current SDSs for all our raw materials and products.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and properly controlled.  Depending on the process, we use both the Hazard and Operability Study and Checklist methodologies to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance, safety, and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOrtec, Inc. maintains written operating procedures in order to safely conduct activities within our covered process.  The procedure for Acrylonitrile tanker unloading addresses personal protective equipment requirements, abnormal conditions, and emergency equipment/supplies requirements.  This procedure is regularly reviewed and used by the operator each time an Acrylonitrile tanker or Vinyl acetate tanker is unloaded.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nOrtec, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who handle monomers are competent in safe handling practices to protect themselves and their surroundings.  Refresher training is provided on Acrylonitrile handling at least yearly and more frequently as needed. Training is also provided periodically on Vinyl acetate handling.  Air monitoring is conducted periodically during unloading "

The results are posted for all employees to review.  \n\n\n\nComprehensive training is conducted specifically for unloading of Acrylonitrile and Vinyl acetate monomer tankers into our bulk storage tank.  Safety procedures and alarms are reviewed during this training.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, employees are trained on RCRA regulations to make them aware of possible environmental impacts.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nOrtec, Inc. carries out documented maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others;  storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  \n\n\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Ortec, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and given training on the modification.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ortec, Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nOrtec, Inc. believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  By participation in the Ortec Safety Committee, employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  "
