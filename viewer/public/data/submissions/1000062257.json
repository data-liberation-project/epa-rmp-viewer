All employees are given an overview on the incident management system, which includes incident investigation. \r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nOrtec, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases of the regulated substances over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental reportable release of Acrylonitrile or Vinyl acetate monomer during this period.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\nOrtec, Inc. has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  \r\n\r\nPickens County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.  Our EHS&S personnel are active members of the LEPC.  Additionally, representatives from the Easley Fire Department are invited to tour the facility yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIIV.   Safety Improvements\r\nTo ensure more regular training of our employees, Ortec,Inc., has increased the safety training staff.  Employees are routinely trained in chemical hazards and chemical release prevention methods.  Ortec, Inc. is also proactive in the area of process safety by conducting hazard analyses on all major processes even when not specifically required by law."

      "SummaryText": "ORTEC, INC.\r\nGeneral Executive Summary\r\n\r\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\n\r\nOrtec, Inc. is strongly dedicated to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment to safety starts with our senior management staff and filters down throughout our entire organization. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with regulated processes at our facility.  \r\n\r\nII. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOrtec, Inc. is a custom chemical manufacturer.  Our primary business includes various adhesives, coating polymers, and similar polymers.  We presently have two regulated toxic substances present at our facility.  These substances are Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile] and Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester].  Both monomers are used to make our polymers.\r\n\r\nBoth Acrylonitrile and Vinyl acetate are stored in a bulk storage tanks. \r\n\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we used the EPA's RMP*Comp. \r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined in 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA regulations.  Our facility also meets the requirements of the OSHA PSM rule.  For Acrylonitrile, a pre-startup review was conducted along with specific training by the supplier on the handling of Acrylonitrile.  All of our affected employees are trained yearly on the hazards associated with Acrylonitrile and safe handling practices.  The Vinyl acetate tank process was reviewed using a process hazard checklist analysis.  Employees were trained on the unloading procedures for both Acrylonitrile and Vinyl"

Only designated employees are qualified to unload Acrylonitrile or Vinyl acetate monomer into the respective bulk storage tank.  \r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nOrtec, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.  We maintain current SDSs for all our raw materials and products.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and properly controlled.  Depending on the process, we use both the Hazard and Operability Study and Checklist methodologies to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance, safety, and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nOrtec, Inc. maintains written operating procedures in order to safely conduct activities within our covered process.  The procedure for Acrylonitrile tanker unloading addresses personal protective equipment requirements, abnormal conditions, and emergency equipment/supplies requirements.  This procedure is regularly reviewed and used by the operator each time an Acrylonitrile tanker or Vinyl acetate tanker is unloaded.  \r\n\r\nTraining\r\nOrtec, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who handle monomers are competent in safe handling practices to protect themselves and their surroundings.  Refresher training is provided on Acrylonitrile handling at least yearly and more frequently as needed. Training is also provided periodically on Vinyl acetate handling.  Air monitoring is conducted periodically during unloading"
