The plant consist of one 30,000 gallon and bulk tank. The facility also has 6 Nurse tanks The total capacity of the facility is 174,000 pounds of ammonia. The facility is designed and maintained with strict accordance with all local, state and federal standards. The South Dakota Department of Agriculture inspects out plant and we comply with their request for the facility if needed.     The Worst case Scenario for our facility would have a toxic gas release of 133000 lbs. with a distance to endpoint of 2 miles and has the potential to affect approximately 350 Residents.   The employees who work in the ammonia plant are trained in safety information, hazards, operating procedures and most important the maintance practices of our anhydrous ammonis plant. Employees always were safety googles and use approriate gloves when filling nurse tanks. Clean safety water is always present durning anhydrous ammonia operations. We inspect our facility on a regular basis and make improvements and repairs when necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                      The excellent training and operations record of our company allows us to report that no injury accidents or property damage has occurred at this storage facility within the last five years."
