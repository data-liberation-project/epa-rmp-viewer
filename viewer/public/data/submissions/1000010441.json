      "SummaryText": "Hayes Heat Treating is a commercial heat treating and brazing facility. HHT is located in Cranston RI.\n\nHayes utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the processing of parts for it's customers. Hayes has reduced the the purchasing of ammonia in the last year (2009). HHT is an active participant in LEPC #3. We have not had a release of material.\n\nPresently, the Cranston Fire Department will be the responders in the event of an accidental release or accident onsite. The fire department and the LEPC assisiatnt chairman last inspected the facility and grounds on o3/03/2008 in order to respond to an emergency in a more effective manner.\n\nAn updated Emergincy plan was submiited to Cranston Fire in October of 2009. \n\nHHT utilizes an annual inspection of all piping, valves and the ammonia tank by the ammonia supplier. Additionally, HHT inspects the piping, tank, and grounds on a bi-weekly basis.\n\nHayes has had ultrasonic inspections of the ammonia tank performed every three years to determine tank integrity.\n\nHayes' primary goal is to provide a safe and clean enviroment for it's workers and the city. HHT participates in the LEPC #3 meetings as a concerned representative of industry in the local community"
