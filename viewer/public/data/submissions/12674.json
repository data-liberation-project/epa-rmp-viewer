Accidental Release Prevention and Emegency Response Policies.\n\nPure Service Inc. stores and repackages chlorine which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated subtance and is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat tothe facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPure Services Inc. provides chlorination services to swimming pools. Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one ton chlorine containers to 20 pound capacity service cylinders. The 20 pound service cylinders are used by California Pool Chem. service staff to chlorine customer swimming pools. The facility operates five days per week (M-F), ten hours per day for fifty weeks per year.\n\nThe facility consists of two separate buildings. One building is a dedicated office building and the other building is used exclusively for the packaging of chlorine. The entire site is fenced. The driveway and yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of the empty one-ton containers.\n\nThe amount of chlorine repackaged per month is seasonally dependent. The summer months, for \nobvious reasons, are the busiest time of the year. Consequently, thje quantity of chlorine on site is \nhighest during this period. Pure Services Inc. stores a maximum of 4800 pounds of chlorine. This amount includes the contents of 2 one ton containers, 40 twenty pound cylinders, and the 1 one ton container in the repackaging process.\n"

The one ton containers, up to a maximum of 2 are stored in the Chemical Building (Fill Yard).\n\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one ton containers into twenty pound net capacity, D.O.T. approved, cylinders. Any residual chlorine in small diameter, short length piping is directed to a \nLiquid caustic absorption scrubber. The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company services \npersonnel to customers' swimming pools where the services personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas \ninto the pool. The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in \naccordance with the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 17 Cylinder and Ton Container Procedures for \nChlorine Packaging.\n\nOff-loading of the one ton chlorine containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with\na hoist. The one ton container are placed on the rails in the chlorine building (Fill Yard). THe one ton \ncontainer are then manually rolled to the desired rail location and chocked to prevent movement.\nEmpty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are chained or strapped in place in an upright\nposition. The company has administrative procedures in place that limits the amount of chlorine at the \nfacility to no more than 2 one ton containers and 40 twenty pound cylinders for a total of 4800 pounds.\nThe procedure, in part requires, the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an\norder and delivery of a one ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 4800 pounds.\n\nThe facility is fenced with a locking gate. The Chemical Building (Fill Yard) is not exposed to vehicular traffic. The chemical building houses all of the chlorine containers and is locked after normal working hours.

Filling commences by opening the one ton container liquid valve, \nthe cylinder valve, and the other in-line valves in the tranfer assembly. After filling, which is indicated by \nweight on the scale reaching the desired valve, the cylinder valve and the liquid chlorine valve on the \ntransfer assembly are closed and the transfer tubing is evacuated by means of the eductor in the chlorine\nabsorption system prior to disconnecting the full service cylinder.
