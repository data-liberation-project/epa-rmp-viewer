We are committed to providing products and services that involve minimum risk to people and the environment throughout their life-cycle, while best meeting the needs of our customers.\n\nAshland has set a Responsible Care goal of operating with zero incidents because we believe no job is so important that it cannot be done safely and without adverse environmental impact. The Zero Incident Culture Process focuses on the safe behaviors that allow us to work without incidents. This process, like other aspects of Responsible Care, looks at management system components (policies, procedures, training, and feedback) to identify potential problems and find better ways to accomplish objectives. \n  \nShared Beliefs & Values AshlandA?s zero incident culture is based on the shared beliefs and values that support a management system and behaviors that result in zero incidents. The five core beliefs of our zero incident culture are:\n\n1. The goal of a zero incident workplace is achievable. We believe the goal of a zero incident workplace is achievable by developing and maintaining management systems that allow us to control risk. Managing risk is accomplished through engineering controls (like safety guards on a machine), administrative controls (like policies, training and procedures), and personal protective equipment (like slip-resistant shoes). \n\n2. Environment, health, safety, and security (EHS&S) is a core value that must be integrated into every aspect of our business. Operating with zero incidents should not compete with business priorities or be seen as an adjacency to what we do. Rather, it must be an integrated component of normal business operations. \n\n3. The goal of a zero incident workplace must be managed as a process. Using the Plan-Do-Check-Act approach of our Responsible Care Management System, our goal is to develop processes that promote both safe behavior and 100% compliance. \n\n\n4.

The entire organization must be engaged. Incident-free performance is not possible without everyoneA?s participation and commitment. \n\nFacility Description:\nThe primary activity at the Parlin Plant is the manufacture of NatrosolA? (hydroxyethyl cellulose). Natrosol A?  is used  as a thickener in latex paint and personal care products. The primary ingredients in Natrosol A? are cellulose (wood or cotton linter fiber) and ethylene oxide. Ethylene oxide is received in 25,000-gallon railroad tank cars and stored in two tanks, each limited to 27,000 gallons by administrative controls. The tanks are protected from having direct sunlight on them by a sun shield. The ethylene oxide unloading and storage area is provided with containment dikes and pits in which a spill can be diluted with water. This facility is also equipped with leak detectors and fixed water spray nozzles to minimize any adverse impacts if there were a spill.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nNo longer required.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario: \nNo longer required.\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\nThe use of ethylene oxide at Parlin has been subject to the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) regulations since their adoption in 1988, as well as the subsequently adopted OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR 1910.119).  The plant has an established risk management system in place to meet these requirements and to minimize the potential for accidental release of these substances. Our management system includes:\n\n1. Process hazard analysis to identify and address potential hazards.\n2. Management of change procedures to assure that standards are maintained and potential new hazards assessed. \n3.
