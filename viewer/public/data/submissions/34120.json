The alarms are tested monthly.\n\nAdditionally, the facility conducts routine reviews of the process safety management (PSM) information associated with the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA PSM) & 40 CFR 68 (EPA RMP) and, therefore, continually reviews, updates and maintains process safety information concerning the chlorine processes.  Examples of process safety information include operating procedures to safely handle toxic materials, management of change procedures for administering changes to the process and process hazards reviews where the safety of the process is routinely analyzed on a 5 year frequency.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThrough training, prevention measures, and safe operating practices, the facility has not experienced the release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide which has adversely affected offsite receptors during its entire operating history.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe facility operators are trained to respond to a minor release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the storage areas.  The operators wearing the proper personal protective equipment are capable of entering the storage areas and repairing or replacing faulty equipment.  In the event of a more significant release, the facility has a mutual aid agreement with the Virginia Department of Emergency Services (VDES), which would provide HAZMAT trained personnel to assist in mitigating the release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe FMC Facility continually reviews the existing operating procedures, process safety information, and training program to protect the safety of its employees and the surrounding population."

The facility treats wastewater received from surrounding municipalities before discharging into the Rappahannock River. The FMC Facility uses chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination before the water is discharged.  The facility receives chlorine and sulfur dioxide in one-ton (2,000-pound) cylinders.  The FMC Facility stores up to a maximum of six cylinders of chlorine and five cylinders of sulfur dioxide at any given time.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are toxic substances regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program Rule [40 CFR Part 68].  The FMC Facility has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This RMP update is being submitted in accordance with the 5-year update frequency as specified in 40 CFR 68.190.\n\nAccident Prevention\n\nThe FMC Facility has used chlorine and sulfur dioxide in its treatment system for its entire operating history.  During that time, facility personnel have taken considerable care in the storage and handling of these substances.  The facility receives one-ton cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide by truck, lifts them using a motorized crane designed specifically for moving one-ton cylinders, and places them on saddles either inside or outside.  The connections to the disinfection system and the dechlorination system are made inside a building to guard against inclement weather.  Before accepting a cylinder, facility operators check the condition of the cylinder and inspect it for leaks.\n \nSensors are located within the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage areas.  The chlorine sensor alarms when the chlorine concentration exceeds 1.5 parts per million (ppm).  The sulfur dioxide sensor alarms when the sulfur dioxide concentration exceeds 10 ppm.  The alarms notify the op"
