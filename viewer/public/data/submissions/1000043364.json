Executive Summary \n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations: \n\n\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5 \n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68 \n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189 \n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119 \n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program. \n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Kirschenman Lamont has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Kirschenman Lamont, Risk and Process Safety Management Program \n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Kirschenman Lamont has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities:       \n\n\n\nProcess Name            Process Chemical             Process Quantity(lbs.) \n\nAmmonia Refrigeration   Anhydrous Ammonia            17,000 \n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage. \n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n\n\n1. Prepared a unified progr"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.) \n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves. \n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description \n\n\n\nKirschenman Enterprises is a commercial cold storage facility for table grapes. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to three (3) cold storage rooms and two (2) precoolers. The rooms are equipped with bunker coils containing chilled liquid ammonia. \n\n\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low pressure accumulator vessel. Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms. Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator vessel located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas. The gas is piped to five (5) reciprocating compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator vessel drains into a liquid transfer vessel. Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to \n\nthe point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver. \n\n\n\nThe system con"

The most recent change to the system occurred in 2011 when California Controlled Atmosphere replaced the relief valves and removed them from the refrigerated space. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, the system is treated as a single process. \n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release. Kirschenman Lamont has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Kirschenman Lamont facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak. \n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outs"

These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History \n\n\n\nKirschenman Lamont has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years. \n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan \n\n\n\nKirschenman Lamont's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements: \n\n\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\n\n\nKirschenman Lamont has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Kirschenman Lamont continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety. \n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Kirschenman Lamont's ability to communicate hazardous situations to \n\nemployees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Kirschenman Lamont's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented. Kirschenman Lamont has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resoluti"

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Kirschenman Lamont employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Kirschenman Lamont will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
