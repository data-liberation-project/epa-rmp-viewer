This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at our facility. \n\nIt is our policy to ensure that controls are in place to prevent possible releases of ammonia. If such a release does occur, our emergency response personnel are trained to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are completely coordinated with the Region 5 LEPC and the Dinuba Fire Department, who provide additional emergency response expertise. \n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \nRuiz Food Products' primary activity in Dinuba is frozen food manufacturing. At our facility, located at 501 South Alta Avenue in Dinuba, CA, we prepare, store and ship frozen food products. Ammonia is our only RMP-regulated substance, and is used to provide refrigeration for the preparation and cold storage of our products. The maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is approximately 75,000 lb. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \nOur facility is in full compliance with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as defined in 40 CFR Part 68, the requirements for the California Accidental Release Prevention program (CalARP), the OSHA PSM requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, and the EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our Dinuba plant. \n\nProcess Safety Information \nRuiz Food Products maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment specifications associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment and pr"

      "SummaryText": "ocess. \n\nProcess Hazards Analysis \nOur facility has conducted comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our ammonia facilities are identified and effectively controlled. We used a Checklist and HAZOP methodology to carry out our process hazards analyses. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations, and will be revalidated at least every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures \nTo further ensure that activities are safely conducted in our ammonia system, Ruiz Food Products has developed written operating procedures to supplement our current on-the-job operator training. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown and startup, and emergency shutdown and startup. This information is regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \n\nTraining \nRuiz Foods has an on-the-job training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating process equipment are competent in the operating procedures associated with this equipment. Written procedures are used to enhance the on-the-job training. Refresher training is provided at least every three years. All training is documented and validated. \n\nMechanical Integrity \nRuiz Food Products has a written maintenance program in place for preventative maintenance of all ammonia equipment to ensure continuing reliable and safe operation. Equipment maintained under this program include pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, compressors and pumps. This maintenance is completed only by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices. Specialized training is provided as needed to ensure maintenance personnel are fully qualified. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in"

This ensures that process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-startup Reviews \nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ruiz Foods. These written review procedures formally ensure that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\nCompliance Audits \nRuiz Foods conducts audits on a regular basis to verify that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \n\nIncident Investigation \nRuiz Food Products promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have resulted in a release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from occurring under similar situations. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \n\nEmployee Participation \nRuiz Foods believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort and has developed a written plan to implement this philosophy. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses. \n\nHot Work P"

It documents that appropriate fire prevention measures have been implemented, and defines the work dates and scope of work to be performed. The permit is kept on site until completion of the work. \n\nContractor Safety \nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Ruiz Food Products has a strict policy of informing the contractors of any known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes within our facility. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \n\nFive-year Accident History \nRuiz Food Products has had a good record of preventing accidental releases. No incidents have occurred over the last 5 years. \n\nEmergency Response Plan \nRuiz Foods has developed a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. \n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. \n\nThe Ruiz Foods Dinuba facility coordinates its emergency response plan with the Region 5 LEPC and the Dinuba Fire Department. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nThe following changes are planned or are already underway to improve the level of safety within our plant.
