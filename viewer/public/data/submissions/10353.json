      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\nCox Creek Water Reclamation Facility\n\nThe Anne Arundel County Cox Creek Water Reclamation Facility (CCWRF) located in Curtis Bay, Maryland is designed to treat up to 15 million gallons per day of domestic wastewater.  The CCWRF treats wastewater from over 110,000 people in Anne Arundel County.  The facility is designed to remove pollutants from wastewater before discharging the reclaimed water into the Patapsco River.  As part of this treatment system, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used for disinfection and dechlorination, respectively.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored at the facility in one-ton cylinders.  Disinfection and dechlorination are common processes used by many wastewater treatment plants in the United States.\n\nAnne Arundel County Department of Public Works personnel have designed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to ensure safe operation of the disinfection and dechlorination processes.  As part of the PSM program, a process hazards analysis has been conducted to evaluate the safety of each of these processes.  The minimum amount of chemicals required to meet the facility's discharge permit parameters is stored in enclosed brick buildings.  Standard operating procedures have been written for the safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders.  Annual training is provided to facility personnel in safe handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and a strict preventative maintenance program has been implemented for each process.  Monitors are installed in each enclosed chemical building to detect any leaks.  If a leak is detected, building ventilation systems shut off automatically preventing any chemical from escaping from the storage buildings.  In the event of a leak, Anne Arundel County Fire Department Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) unit is contacted and, if necessary, they will slowly and safely mitigate the situation under controlled conditions.

One scenario evaluated an uncontrolled release of the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  This release scenario which was approximated by using the Anne Arundel County HAZMAT unit's computerized air dispersion models indicated that an unmitigated worst-case release would have off- site impacts.\n\nMeasures including leak detection alarms and automatic ventilation shut off are installed at each storage building to mitigate a potential leak, so it is unlikely that the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder would be released without being safely contained in the storage building.  Alternative release scenarios for each process were also conducted to evaluate more likely releases from the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  Based on the process hazard analysis conducted at the CCWRF, a likely scenario is a leak of chlorine or sulfur dioxide at the connection on a one-ton cylinder.  Modeling conducted by the Anne Arundel County HAZMAT unit indicated that such a release might have some off-site impact.\n\nCoordination between the Anne Arundel County Fire Department HAZMAT unit and the facility personnel enhances and ensures safe facility operation as well as emergency response to any chemical situation.  The interagency relationship between the HAZMAT unit and the CCWRF personnel has fostered open communication and coordination of emergency response procedures and the safe handling and storage practices for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  In addition, HAZMAT unit personnel were directly involved in development of this Risk Management Plan for the CCWRF, both in conducting release scenario modeling and with providing input to the emergency response program at the facility.
