With regards to 40 CFR Part 68, anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia (>20% concentration) are handled and stored at quantities exceeding the threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia was first used at the site in 1956 with the startup of an anhydrous ammonia synthesis plant.  The current facility includes two horizontal storage tanks for anhydrous ammonia.  The \"R-Grade Tank\" (with about 18,000 gallon working capacity, or about 92,626 pounds) is located in the ammonia receiving area while the \"Surge Tank\" (with about 3,900 gallon working capacity, or about 41,715 pounds) is located in the ammonium sulfate production area.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the facility to produce aqueous ammonia and ammonium sulfate.  No anhydrous ammonia is shipped from the facility.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is received in 86 ton capacity rail cars.  The intent is to have a maximum of five railcars stored at one time for a total storage capacity of 860,000 lbs.  The anhydrous ammonia is unloaded in a closed system using a compressor to remove vapors from the larger storage vessel and pressurizing the rail car with this vapor.  The resultant differential pressure pushes the liquefied anhydrous ammonia to the storage vessel.  The maximum pressur"

      "SummaryText": "e in the anhydrous ammonia system during unloading and storage is 120 psig.  The operational pressure rating for the storage vessel is 250 psig.\n\n\n\nTransfers of liquid anhydrous ammonia from the larger storage vessel to either aqueous ammonia production or to the smaller vessel are via small transfer pumps.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia unit started production in 1995.  Aqueous ammonia is produced by injecting a controlled volume of anhydrous ammonia in a re-circulating flow of unfinished aqueous ammonia.  The batch production process is continued until the desired concentration of ammonia in the solution is reached.  The maximum batch size (limited by the working capacity of the production tank) is approximately 9,000 gallons.  Finished aqueous ammonia is stored in a tank with an approximate working capacity of 25,000 gallons.  Both of the aqueous ammonia vessels are located in a common containment structure.\n\n\n\nAmmonium sulfate has been produced in Searsport since 1949.  A new modern production unit went into service in 1993.  The older unit was shutdown in August of that year.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is supplied to the ammonium sulfate process as a vapor.  The Surge Tank is coupled with a small vaporizer.  The combined units are maintained at a constant level to permit steady-state vaporization of the ammonia.  The maximum pressure in this anhydrous ammonia system during ammonium sulfate production is 120 psig.  The operational pressure ratings for both the smaller storage vessel and the vaporizer are 250 psig each.\n\n3.0    RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFour regulated processes exist at the facility. They are as follows:\n\nProcess 1: Anhydrous ammonia receiving and storage\n\nProcess 2: Aqueous ammonia production and storage \n\nProcess 3: Ammonium sulfate production \n\nProcess 4: Railcar storage of anhydrous ammonia\n\nAll release scenarios were analyzed using RMP*Comp for the impact radius calculations and MARPLOT for estimating the affected population within the impacted areas.

The calculated impact radius is 6.9 miles. The estimated population that may be affected is 9,313 in 5,217 residences. A catastrophic failure is extremely unlikely since it would require a structural failure of the stationary rail car or the impact and penetration of the vessel shell by some object of significant mass and/or velocity. The rail cars are maintained (inspections, external coatings) by their owners to prevent corrosion from the weather. The anhydrous ammonia grade shipped to GAC is not corrosive to the steel tank interior. The possibility of an object piercing the rail car vessel is very unlikely due to the isolation of the anhydrous ammonia unloading location and the absence of other activities or traffic in the area. \n\nProcess 2: Catastrophic failure of the aqueous ammonia (29% concentration) storage tank containing 190,294 pounds of solution (55,185 pounds of 100% ammonia). The tank is located within a containment structure with a surface area of 1,424 square feet and a depth of 39 inches. The calculated impact radius is 2.7 miles. The estimated population that may be affected is 1,678 in 1,072 residences. A catastrophic failure is extremely unlikely since it would require a structural failure of the tank. The tank is maintained (inspections and coatings) to prevent external corrosion from the weather. The aqueous ammonia is not corrosive to the steel tank interior. External impact is not possible due to the physical installation of barriers. \n\nProcess 3: Catastrophic failure of an anhydrous ammonia process tank (Surge tank) in the ammonium sulfate area containing 41,715 pounds of material. No containment or passive mitigation was used. The calculated impact radius is 3.6 miles. The estimated "

These documents address (a) chemical properties and associated hazards, (b) limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and (c) equipment design information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs) which are located in various locations onsite, on a company server, and on the internet via a cloud-based SDS service. \n\nThe facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. Refer to the GAC PSM Manual for more information.\n\n4.2 Process Hazard Analysis\n\nGAC has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nGAC primarily uses the What-If/Checklist and HAZOP analysis techniques to perform this evaluation. These are recognized "

The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards and makes recommendations to mitigate the risk.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. The final recommendations are tracked to closure, and resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the GAC facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility, or at minimum every five years. The results and findings from these updates are also documented and retained.  Refer to the GAC PSM Manual.\n\n4.3 Operating Procedures\n\nGAC maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to maintain correctness and annually certified as current and accurate.  In addition, procedures include key process parameters and guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available in the facility for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  Refer to the GAC PSM Manual.\n\n4.4 Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, GAC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating"

This refresher training is conducted at least every three years, or more frequently if requested. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.  Refer to the GAC PSM Manual.\n\n4.5 Mechanical Integrity\n\nGAC has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. These activities are based on ANSI/CGA 2.1 \"Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and other relevant RAGAGEP.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nPersonnel who perform maintenance activities receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nJob plans/written procedures/checklists help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

GAC incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. Refer to the GAC PSM Manual.\n\n4.6 Management of Change\n\nGAC has a comprehensive system to manage changes to covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment and facility information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  Refer to the GAC PSM Manual.\n\n4.7 Pre-Startup Review\n\nGAC conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

All corrective actions are tracked until they are completed, and the two most recent audit reports are retained at the facility.  Refer to the GAC PSM Manual.\n\n4.9 Third-Party Audits\n\nIn the event of a release of ammonia that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury, as required by RMP regulations, GAC will retain the services of a third-party to complete the next scheduled compliance audit as required by 40 CFR 68.80. Refer to the GAC PSM Manual.\n\n4.10 Incident investigation\n\nGAC promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury (at least within 48 hours). The goal of each investigation is to determine the causes of the incident and develop corrective actions. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
