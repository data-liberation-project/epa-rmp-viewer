This Executive Summary is provided to demonstrate Kimberly-Clark\u00c2\u00bfs continuing commitment to run an operation in Everett that is safe both to its employees and the surrounding community.\n\n5-year Anniversary Date Revision\nThis revised RMP is submitted for the 5-year anniversary date of the last RMP plan submission on 07/28/2005.  Kimberly-Clark Everett has had no major changes to the RMP covered chemical systems since the last plan submission.  This re-submitted plan includes updated dates for items in our prevention program and population updates in our hypothetical accidental releases of chlorine dioxide, anhydrous liquid sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, and aqueous ammonia.    \n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\nThe Kimberly-Clark (K-C) Everett mill consists of a 500 air dried metric ton ammonium based sulfite pulp mill, a bleach plant, two pulp drying machines, and five paper machines.  The pulp mill was built in the 1930s and was owned by the Soundview Pulp Company until the early 1950s, when it was purchased by Scott Paper Company.  Scott Paper added paper machines and owned the operation until it merged with Kimberly-Clark Corporation in 1995.\n\nIn the sulfite pulping operation, softwood and hardwood chips are cooked in batch digesters utilizing ammonium bisulfite cooking acid prepared on site.  The cooking separates the pulp fibers from the binding material (lignin) which holds them together.  To prepare the cooking acid, sulfur dioxide gas (SO2) is mixed with an aqueous solution of ammonia (NH3).\n\nThe sulfur dioxide is primarily generated by burning elemental sulfur, but is also reclaimed from the recovery boiler flue gas.  Alternatively, it is obtained by"

This quantity of SO2 is above the 5,000 pound threshold for the Risk Management Program; consequently, it is subject to the RMP regulations.  \n\nThe ammonia is brought to the site in anhydrous form via 80 ton rail cars.  This quantity exceeds the 10,000 pound RMP threshold for anhydrous ammonia; consequently, it is subject to the RMP regulations.  The ammonia is pumped from the rail cars and diluted with water prior to storage in a 150,000 gallon tank.  The aqueous ammonia is stored at approximately 22% strength; this quantity stored exceeds the 20,000 pound RMP threshold for aqueous ammonia, so aqueous ammonia is also subject to the RMP regulations.  The ammonia solution is employed on site not only to prepare the cooking acid, but also for pollution control: it is used as a reactant in the sulfite recovery boiler to remove nitrogen oxides from air emissions, and it is used in the mill's secondary wastewater treatment plant to provide the nutrients needed for proper operation.  It is also used to buffer concentrated spent sulfite liquor prior to storage. \n\nPulp leaving the digesters is transported to three counter-current pressure washers; weak spent sulfite liquor from the washers is transported to multiple effect evaporators where it is concentrated.  The concentrated sulfite liquor is then burned in the sulfite recovery boiler to generate steam.  \n\nAfter washing, the sulfite pulp is bleached.  The bleaching system, described in the plan submitted to EPA in August 2000, utilizes three bleaching stages: chlorine dioxide, caustic extraction with oxygen and peroxide, and chlorine dioxide.  \n\nThe chlorine dioxide solution is manufactured at the mill via the Solvay process.  In this process, sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, and hydrogen peroxide are mixed in a primary reactor through which air is bubbled.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e hydrogen peroxide reacts with the sodium chlorate in this acidic environment to produce gaseous chlorine dioxide (ClO2).  The primary reactor feeds a smaller secondary reactor.  In this smaller reactor, additional hydrogen peroxide and bubbled air are added to drive the reaction to completion.  The chlorine dioxide gas is collected in the vapor space of the reactor vessel and transferred to an absorption tower.  In this tower chilled water is introduced to absorb the chlorine dioxide, forming a solution containing 8 to 14 grams per liter (approximately 1% ClO2).  The chlorine dioxide solution is then transferred to 45,000 gallon storage tanks of 1% chlorine dioxide solution for use in the bleaching process.  Each tank contains up to 5,000 pounds of chlorine dioxide.  As this quantity exceeds the 1,000 pound RMP reporting threshold, chlorine dioxide is subject to the RMP rule.\n\nKimberly-Clark\u00c2\u00bfs Safety Program\nWe at Kimberly-Clark view safety as the most important aspect of our operations.  Consequently, not only what we do, but also how we do it is of utmost importance; this world-class safety philosophy extends to all facets of our operations.   Over the past five years, there have been no deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, or environmental damage caused by accidental releases from RMP covered processes. \n\nThe facility employs two full time Safety Managers and three environmental professionals.  An environmental engineer monitors the Process Safety and Risk Management programs, ensuring the elements of these programs as listed below are properly executed.  In addition, the mill maintains an emergency response (HazMat) team (ERT) staffed with trained individuals; this team is available 24 hours a day.  In addition, this team is qualified to confined space rescue. The ERT conducts drills to respond to simulated chemical accidents.  A plant health and safety committee, compos"

Any overpressure would normally vent to the aqueous ammonia tank.\n\n* The aqueous ammonia system is equipped with emergency shutoffs, pressure control, and leak detection devices.  Overpressure normally vents from the tank via a stack equipped with a scrubber which converts any gas back into ammonia solution.\n\n* The chlorine dioxide generator is equipped with fail-safe controls, which will shut down the system should an upset ever occur.  Either high temperature or high pressure in the generator off-gas will activate the interlocking system.  As a result: 1) the chemical feeds will stop.  2) The dilution air will be diverted from the bottom of the reactor to the gas phase.  This will terminate the stripping of chlorine dioxide, will purge the ClO2 and decomposition products from the reactor, and will cool the gas space and gas lines.  3) The generator cannot be restarted until the gas temperature falls below the critical set point.\n\n* The mill\u00c2\u00bfs process control system is used to control the ClO2 process.

K-C has provided the county 911 system with an Emergency Alert System (EAS) whereby citizens can be advised of a problem and given directions via Emergency Broadcast System interruption of radio and television transmissions.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety\nKimberly-Clark has completed the following steps to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases, and to minimize the impacts of releases that could conceivably occur.\n\n* Elimination of Methanol in Chlorine Dioxide production:  Kimberly-Clark switched from methanol, sodium chlorate, and sulfuric acid for production of chlorine dioxide to hydrogen peroxide, sodium chlorate, and sulfuric acid.  This eliminated the import, storage, and use of methanol at the mill.  The dilute aqueous chlorine dioxide solution is essentially used as it is generated, keeping the quantity stored low and greatly reducing risks to the surrounding community.  \n\n* Improved Traffic Barriers.  Kimberly-Clark evaluated potential traffic accidents that could damage piping containing aqueous ammonia solution, and installed new traffic barriers at some locations.  After installation of the barriers, there is no realistic likelihood of a traffic accident causing damage to process piping at the ammonia system.  \n\n* Enclosure of Liquid Sulfur Dioxide Tanks:  The two liquid SO2 tanks are located inside the northwest corner of the pulp digester building.

This relocation further reduced the likelihood of an event occurring while offloading a liquid sulfur dioxide truck.\n\n* Community Cooperation:  Based on the history of the plant, a significant accidental release is only a remote possibility.  However, since such a release could impact industries, commercial areas, and residential areas, Kimberly-Clark is working with the Snohomish County Local Emergency Planning Committee to minimize any potential impact.  As mentioned above, K-C worked with the County Department of Emergency Management (DEM) to upgrade their existing Emergency Alert System (EAS) so it now provides 911 service 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.  This should greatly reduce community risk should a major chemical release or other catastrophe occur.  The leader of the ERT routinely meets with the LEPC.\n\nHypothetical Accidental Release Scenarios\nThe Risk Management Plan must assess the downwind impacts of hypothetical uncontrolled accidental releases.  EPA requires facilities to model the distance that a plume of released gas would travel before it dissipates to an ambient concentration equal to the Toxic Endpoint Concentration.  The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for various compounds are specified by EPA, and are generally concentrations that would cause no lasting physical harm but could interfere with the ability of people to leave the area.  The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for the RMP chemicals at the facility are: 200 parts per million (ppm) of ammonia, 1 ppm of chlorine dioxide, and 3 ppm of sulfur dioxide. \n\nKimberly-Clark conducted safety reviews with plant operators, mechanics, engineers, and safety managers to evaluate a wide range of hypothetical accidents that could cause releases of ammonia, chlorine dioxide, or sulfur dioxide.

Similarly the rate at which the pool would evaporate was calculated using the method described in the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Guide for Estimating Offsite Consequences.  Since the evaporation rate is less than the pipe release rate, a pool would indeed form and the emission to the ambient air would be controlled by the rate of pool evaporation.
