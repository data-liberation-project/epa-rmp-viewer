We also provide our employees with extensive training in the safe operation of those processes and equipment.\n\n\n\nEmergency Action - We have developed an OSHA hazardous substance Emergency Action Plan. This plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Lodi Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment. The Lodi Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.

Prevention Program (?68.155(d) and ?2745.3(c)):\n\nWe have developed and implemented a prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule. For our facility, the prevention program requirements for the EPA's RMP rule and CalARP regulations are nearly identical to the PSM rule. The following section briefly describes the 12 elements of our prevention program:\n\n\n\na)    Process Safety Information - We maintain a variety of technical documents, including an emergency preparedness plan, to help ensure that employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our facility. These documents address (1) physical properties of anhydrous ammonia, (2) operating parameters for our equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration for our equipment. We ensure that "

A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of our process. This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with PHA experience. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the covered process. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.\n\nResponsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to plant personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented. The analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n\n\nc)    Operating Procedures - Our operators and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safety performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and in the unlikely event of a process upset. Operating procedures include: (1) steps for safely conducting activities, (2) applicable process safety information, such as operating limits and consequences of process deviations, and\n\n(3) safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs.\n\n\n\nd)    Training - We train workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.

All of our personnel are trained in evacuation procedures. The EHS Manager is responsible for apprising the Region IV Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of the emergency situation, and the LEPC is responsible for notifying the public, if necessary.\n\n7.
