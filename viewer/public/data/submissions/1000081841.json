A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of our process. This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with PHA experience. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the covered process. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.\r\nResponsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to plant personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.

This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\ng)\tPre-Startup Review - We recognize that new or newly modified processes are more likely to be involved in accidental releases. Therefore, we perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation. This review confirms that: (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications, (2) adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, (3) employee training has been completed, and (4) a PHA has been performed (if required) if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified.\r\n\r\nh)\tCompliance Audit - One of the corner"

      "SummaryText": "stones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment. We audit our covered process every 3 years to be certain our program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations. We assemble an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP rules and in our process design, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these rules and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\ni)\tThird-Party Audit - Should we experience an accidental release that results in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage, we will employ an independent, third-party to conduct the next Compliance Audit.\r\n\r\n \r\nj)\tIncident Investigation - We investigate all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in (i.e., a near miss) serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future. We train our employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\r\n\r\nk)\tEmployee Participation - We have a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of our workers are addressed. We encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility. Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nl)\tHot Work Permits - We have a hot work permit pro"

We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit system to comply with these requirements. Training in the use of the hot work permit system is included in our safe work practices orientation.\r\n\r\nm)\tContractors - We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner. This program reviews the safety record of all our contractors to help ensure that we hire only contractors who can safely perform the desired tasks. We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency action procedures. The Contractor is required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who work at the facility before that worker begins work at our facility. And finally, we periodically review contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\r\n\r\n5.\tFive-Year Accident History (\u00a768.155(d)):\r\nThere have been no reportable incidents during the past five years. The incident identified in this RMP was erroneously reported as it did not meet the criteria for a reportable incident. Additionally, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of the amount of anhydrous ammonia released into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n6.\tEmergency Action Plan and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a768.155(e) and \u00a72745.3(e)):\r\nWe have developed and implemented an OSHA hazardous substance emergency action plan for anhydrous ammonia. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting. The emergency action plan includes procedures for:\r\n\r\na)\tInforming the National Response Center (NRC), LEPC, Fire Department, Police, etc. about accidental releases that could reasonably result in off"

Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for anhydrous ammonia, a list of action items was developed. The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished. Monthly safety training is conducted for all team members at this facility, in addition PSM meetings are held to review safety and PSM program elements."
