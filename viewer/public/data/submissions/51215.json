The plant is staffed by approximately 13 regular employees.  This plant is located north of Yuba City adjacent to the Feather River.  There are some residences and commercial/industrial occupancies nearby.  The facility treats water from the Feather River.  The water plant has a capacity of 42MGD.  The City has one regulated acutely hazardous material on site \u00c2\u00bf chlorine.   \n\nThese EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Support Documents satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.  \n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe WTP accidental release prevention policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The facility adheres to all applicable procedures of the federal EPA Risk Management Program (EPA-RMP).  The emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to this plant and to the emergency response of the community and local responding agencies.  It is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (ARP) is in compliance with the federal and State OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and is based upon the following key elements:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA high level of training for the facility state certified plant operators.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA preventive maintenance program with strict adherence.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tUse of state of the art process and safety equipment to control and neutralize any accidental release of chemical.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe use of an accurate and effective operating procedure written with participation of the operators.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPerformance of hazard review of equipment and procedures.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAssignment of the plant supervisor with overall responsibility of the RMP and Cal/ARP\n\u00c2\u00bf\tImplementation of an auditing"

The operation of this facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and to the OSHA regulations regarding Process Safety Management.\n2.\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \u00c2\u00bf A PHA has been conducted appropriate to the complexity of the chlorination process that identified, evaluated, and controlled potential hazards using the \u00c2\u00bfWhat-If Checklist\u00c2\u00bf and \u00c2\u00bfHazard Review Checklists\u00c2\u00bf processes.  These processes include the analysis of hazards due to equipment malfunction and human error.  It describes steps used to detect and monitor releases.  This PHA will be updated every five years and the Yuba City WTP will conduct reviews whenever major changes occur to the process.\n3.\tOperating Procedures \u00c2\u00bf The WTP has prepared written procedures that provide clear instructions for the safe operational activities associated with the process.
