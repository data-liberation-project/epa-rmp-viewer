A Management System focused on process safety (i.e. Process Safety Management System) has been developed at the facility to consist of the 14 independent programs to address the \"elements\" required under both the PSM Standard and Subpart D of Environmental Protection Agency's 40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. These 14 programs and have been integrated into the accident prevention plan requirements under the facility's Risk Management Program.\n\nCompliance with the PSM Standard provides the foundation for compliance with the Risk Management Program, and there is a continuous effort to maintain and improve our compliance programs related to PSM. These specific programs have been integrated into the facility's daily operations and business model to ensure that there is adequate recognition and resources to effectively implement. Collectively, these prevention program activities help minimize potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures; human errors; and external events\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nStyropek's Beaver Valley plant has had no reportable accidental releases (i.e. as defined by \u00a7 68.42) of regulated substances in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Styropek's Beaver Valley plant maintains a written integrated contingency plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.
