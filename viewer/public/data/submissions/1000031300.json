The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r)(1) The Prevention Program elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29 CFR Part 11910.119.\r\n                                                                                                                     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: It is  PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and State requirements. The disinfection process at the Canovanas Nueva Water Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO. Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Canovanas Nueva Water Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine. The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Canovanas Nueva Water Filtration Plant and immediately surrounding areas. Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency respose program for response to any chlorine realease that may occure.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The Canovanas Nueva Filtration Plant supplies water to the surrounding community. Chlorine is used to disinfect water, destroying microorganisms that could cause illness in humans. Chlorine is delivered to the facility  via truck in ton containers. The storage building has space for up to twenty full containers, a total of 40,000 pounds of chlorine. Chlorine containers are connected to vaccum chlorinators. The chlorinators regulate chlorine use. From the chlorinators, chlor"

The worts-case scenarion is a vapor release of the entire contens of a ton container over a ten minute period (200 pounds of clorine per minute). Other worst-case assumptions required by EPA include a low wind speed (1.5 meters per second), stable atmosphere (Class F), and no active mitigation of the release. EPA requires the detremination of the area (zone of vulnerability) which may exposed to a chorine concentration of 3 ppm or greater. According the American Industrial Hygine Association, 3 ppm is the maximun concentration of chlorine in air below which nearly all people could be exposed for one hour without serios health effects. No known environmental receptors (such as state parks or officially designated wildlife preserves) are located within the zone of vulnerability.\r\nThe conditions and parameters for the worst-case scenario are specified by EPA. A more realistic alternative release scenario was examined, also following EPA's Risk Management Program Consequence Analysis Guidance. The alternative release scenario is a vapor release of the entire contents of a ton container through a broken 3/8 inch flexible connector tube. If the container was not shut off, the contens would release at rate 21 pounds of chlorine per minute over a 95 minute period. More typical weather conditions used  (wind speed of 3.0 metewrs per second, atmospheric stability Class D).\r\n                                                                                                                     General Accidental Release Prevention Pro"
