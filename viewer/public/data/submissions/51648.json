This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Castle Rock Vineyards business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n2.\tDESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nThe Castle Rock Vineyards facility is a commercial cold storage facility for table grapes.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  Some rooms are designated as \u00bfprecooling\u00bf rooms, while others are for cold storage. The rooms are equipped with \u00bfbunker style\u00bf and ceiling suspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  There is a coo"

      "SummaryText": "led loading dock area as well.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.  \n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a main king valve.  From there, high pressure liquid is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to a primary accumulator vessel, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.  \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency \u00bfdump box\u00bf contains switches and"

Therefore, the facility is treated as a single process.\n3.\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Castle Rock Vineyards facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The system contains a total charge of approximately 62,500 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.  Castle Rock Vineyards has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of this analysis are reported in the body of the program.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in pre-season safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nCastle Rock Vineyards has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n5.\tEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based on the Cal/OS"

Under this plan our ammonia refrigeration personnel will take whatever defensive steps are necessary to bring a release under control. The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment. To better prepare for this type of action, initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the HAZWOPER regulations will take place within the next year. All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and the Tulare County Fire Department and the Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n6.\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Castle Rock Vineyards continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Castle Rock Vineyards business practices rather than the order presented in the law.

The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Castle Rock Vineyards now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \u00bfliving document\u00bf.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Castle Rock Vineyards employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Castle Rock Vineyards will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
