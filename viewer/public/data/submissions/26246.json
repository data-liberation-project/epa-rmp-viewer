Brenntag Southwest participates in the Responsible Distribution Process program of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD). The Community Outreach and Emergency Response Plan of Responsible Distribution Process brings chemical distribution plants and local communities together through communications and cooperative emergency planning.  The company is also a long-term member of the Chlorine Institute, a worldwide organization that focuses on the safe handling of chlorine. Brenntag Southwest is an ISO-9000 certified company with Health, Safety, and Environmental policies and procedures in place, which are designed to prevent emergencies such as fires, explosions and accidental chemical releases. \n\nBrenntag Southwest is a Business Unit of Brenntag, Inc., which serves customers worldwide with products, chemicals, and advanced materials. The company ranks among the top chemical distribution firms in North America. It is the worldwide policy of Brenntag to design, blend and distribute its products and to handle materials throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers and the public from unacceptable risk. \n\nPLANT DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Brenntag Southwest facility is located in a rural area north of the town of Nowata, which is in the northeast part of the state of Oklahoma.  The company employs 18 full-time employees who carry out distribution activities that include the repackaging of Chlorine, and the storing and handling of Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxidea in compliance with the Prevention Program Level 3 requirements,  storage and handling of Propylene Oxide in compliance with Prevention Program 2, and storage and handling ofTrimethylamine at the site in compliance with Prevention Program Level 1 rules.

The facility provides these and other quality products to customers in the eastern Oklahoma, Kansas and other surrounding states.\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nChlorine has many beneficial uses some of which include the production of consumer goods such as plastics, pipe, automobile parts, and toys among a few, but Chlorine's main use in this area remains the treatment of waters ensuring safe drinking water for all.  Sulfur Dioxide is also used in the treatment of water among other uses.  Trimethylamine and Propylene Oxide are commodity chemicals used as a building block in the production of derivatives that are used to make everyday products like cosmetics, antifreezes, and lubricants.  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community as well as to the employees of the company.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nBrenntag Southwest owns emergency equipment specifically designed to be able to stop leaks from containers of these products.  This equipment includes Chlorine Institute approved A and B kits for cylinders and ton containers, and a cylinder recovery vessel.  Brenntag maintains employees who are trained in the specialized use of this emergency equipment and also maintains agreements with area response companies who are equipped with their own kits.  \n\nThe Emergency Programs in place at the facility include an Emergency Action Plan, Fire Prevention Plan, Emergency Response Plan, and a Transportation Emergency Plan.  These plans require the facility to maintain an open door policy with local fire departments and other emergency groups in the area, and to invite emergency responders from both the public and private sectors to tour the facility annuall"

These plans also direct the facility to maintain a working relationship with area clinics and hospitals in order to be prepared during emergency events of any kind.   \n\nWORST CASE & ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe EPA was required by law to define the Worst Case Scenario (WCS), as an unlikely event: the largest single storage vessel losing all of its contents in 10 minutes.  In the history of the company no event of this magnitude has ever occurred, but under this law, the facility does have off-site consequences to the public and the environment. \n\nThe EPA calls a more likely incident, many of which will have limited or no off-site consequences, an Alternate Release Scenario (ARS).  An ARS for this facility could be a minor leak from a cylinder or container.  For the facility the ARS will have off-site consequences, but would be limited to an area in close proximity to the plant.  \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nBrenntag Southwest, Inc., maintains Health, Safety and Environmental policies for Risk Management, Training, Product Stewardship, Community Outreach, Hazard Communication, and Process Safety Management among others.  These policies require careful review of the hazards and the safeguards that must be implemented to prevent releases of regulated chemicals. Along with these programs, the company implements the knowledge gained from being a long-term member of The Chlorine Institute. The Institute establishes written pamphlets, and videos among other information to guide facilities in prevention and emergency programs that cover issues such as processing, handling, storage, and releases of chemicals such as Chlorine.  Coupled with the numerous training programs from the Institute, the company also complies with container specifications, inspections, and testing requirements of law"

Still other programs such as the NACD's Responsible Distribution Process, and guidance implemented based on EPA's SARA Title III regulations along with BOCA Building and Fire Codes have aided the company in designing and operating a safe plant.  These programs and regulations in conjunction with company policy help to ensure that the possibility of a release of this magnitude would never occur at the facility.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nThe Brenntag Southwest Nowata branch was established in the 1980\u00bfs, and in the last five years did have a release of a couple of hundred pounds of chlorine gas over a three hour period in the spring of 2000.  The release was due an employee\u00bfs failure to follow proper production procedures.  The contributing factors of the release was addressed, the company installed additional engineering controls that will greatly reduce the possibility of any re-occurrence.  The Emergency Action and Response Plan worked well as there were no injuries to plant personnel or to the public.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has emergency plans, which are coordinated with local fire departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Our response plan for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is based upon the Chlorine Institute\u00bfs Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  For the flammable products, the plans are based off of information from the manufacturers of these materials. The emergency response plans for all company facilities include procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors, the local fire authority, and federal, state, and local agencies.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn order to continue to improve upon its safety record, Brenntag Southwest requires all of its facilities to conduct incident investigations, safety compliance audits, continuous training of normal, and emergency procedures, and continuous community outreach actions which include:"
