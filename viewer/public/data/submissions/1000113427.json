Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSeadrift Operations of the Union Carbide Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both internal Responsible Care  requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nUnion Carbide Seadrift Operations is a manufacturing facility that annually produces plastic and other chemical products in its various operating plants.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide and Dow processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Seadrift Site, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and/or flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.\n\n Union Carbide Seadrift  Operations has the following RMP-regulated toxic and flammable substances in quantities above the threshold: \n\nRMP Toxic Chemicals:  Ethylene Oxide, Ammonia, Vinyl Acetate, Propylene Oxide, Titanium Tetrachloride\nRMP Flammable Chemicals:  Butene-1, Ethylene, Isopentane, Methane, Propylene\n\n3.Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our"

Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, appear in other sections of this plan.\n\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario --\n\nThis scenario assumes an over-pressure and rupture of a storage tank, releasing 294,000 pounds of ethylene oxide as a gas to the atmosphere.   An administrative control limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 85% (294,000pounds).  According to EPA's RMP Comp Offsite Consequence Analysis results, this release could extend beyond the site fenceline and possibly impact the public .  The following administrative control is used in this analysis:\n\nInventory Restriction:  Written operating procedures and a high-level shutdown system limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 85 percent (294,000 pounds).\n\nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n1) Double Wall Tank:  The tank has a secondary tank wall which is designed to contain a leak in the primary wall.\n2) Secondary Wall Leak Detection:  A sensor is designed to detect leaks between the primary and secondary walls of the tank.\n3) Enclosed Tanks:  The surge tanks are inside concrete containment walls and covered with gravel to minimize the potential for external impact.\n4) Secondary Containment Around Tanks:  The area around the tanks is diked and curbed to contain spills.\n5) Combustible Gas Detectors Interlocked to Sprinkler-Deluge System:  This system is designed to detect flammable vapors and to automatically activate the deluge system (water spray) to suppress flammable vapors.\n6) Emergency Shutdown System:  A manual emergency shutdown system is designed to shut down the pumps, place t"
