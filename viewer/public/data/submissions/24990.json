Only properly trained employees perform the work of loading the ammonia tanks.  An Emergency Response Plan has been developed and an outside emergency response contractor; KAM,INC. has been hired to respond to site emergencies.  As required by EPA regulations, this Risk Management Plan contains a Worst Case Release Scenario and an Alternative Release Scenario for the release of Ammonia.  EPA's April, 1999 Guidance for Offsite Release Analysis states that since worst case scenario distances are based on modeling conditions that are unlikely to occur, and since modeling of any scenario that results in large distances is very uncertain, EPA strongly urges communities and industry not to rely on the results of worst case modeling or any modeling that result in very large toxic endpoint distances in emergency planning and response.  Results of alternartive models for Plant Goat Rock show that an accidental release of ammonia will not leave the plant site and will not effect any public receptors."
