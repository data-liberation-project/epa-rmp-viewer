Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; the facility will implement the Emergency Action Plan and contact appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Dandy Cooling Company - OXS's facility is located at 2640 Sturgis Road in Oxnard, California, which is approximately 1.5 miles south of Highway 101 and 0.2 miles east of Highway 1-Pacific Coast Highway. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of industrial facilities and farming.\n\nThe ammonia system at Dandy Cooling Company - OXS was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations, codes, and standards including mechanical codes, fire codes, and building codes in place at the time of construction.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nA complete and thorough description of the release scenarios can be found in the 2022 Hazard Assessment report.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Dandy Cooling Company - OXS ammonia system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems are inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems. \n\nThe PSM / RMP / CalARP program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff is trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia systems.  All pressure vessels in the ammonia systems are equipped with relief valves that vent to the water diffusion tank at a certain pressure set point. A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are inspected regularly to ensure proper operation.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Dandy Cooling Company - OXS's facility"

      "SummaryText": "is a non-responding facility and has an emergency action plan (EAP) in effect. The Plan provides the emergency organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and ammonia health hazards information needed during an emergency. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM / RMP / CalARP regulations.\n\nIn the event of an ammonia emergency, Dandy Cooling Company - OXS plans to evacuate all employees and alert the local emergency responders (fire department). Dandy Cooling Company - OXS personnel plan to coordinate emergency efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince taking ownership of the Dandy Cooling Company - OXS facility in August 2022, there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in 24 hours or that meet the CalARP reporting criteria for the Five-Year Accident History as specified above. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCurrently, the facility is modifying its system to allow the facility to charge above the 10,000lb threshold putting the facility under the EPA RMP jurisdiction. As part of that process, the facility is currently completing a Management of Change procedure designed to highlight the health and safety risks associated with the proposed modifications. Those areas will include updates to the Process Safety Information, revised system drawings, further development of contractor safety and employee participation procedures among other things. Dandy Cooling Company - OXS personnel are committed to implementing these changes prior to accepting additional ammonia  storage onsite."
