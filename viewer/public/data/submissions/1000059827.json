This includes revised off-site consequences analyses for the Heber 1 and Heber 2 isopentane processes with the use of the EPA's RMP Comp. Both facilities are operated by Ormat-Nevada, Inc. and located in Heber, California.\r\n\r\nBoth Heber facilities have processes that contain greater amounts of isopentane than the state and federal threshold planning quantities for this flammable substance established under Section 112(r) of the federal Clean Air Act and Article 2, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code. The isopentane processes at Heber 1 and Heber 2 are subject to the Program 3 requirements for the RMP.\r\n\r\nThe updated RMP meets the requirements of the federal Risk Management Program contained in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program contained in Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations. The quantities of the regulated substance handled at the facilities also exceed the threshold quantities in the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management regulations in 29 CFR 1910.119 and require hazard assessment under that program. \r\n\r\nBoth Heber 1 and Heber 2 use isopentane as the working fluid in the Rankine cycles for its Ormat Energy Converter Units. The isopentane is delivered by qualified suppliers, stored in a secure area designed for seismic loads, pumped to the individual units, and circulated and recovered through a closed-loop system. The plants have leak detection monitors and fire protection equipment installed throughout the isopentane process area. The RMP describes the current methods of delivery, storage, transfer, use, and recovery of this flammable substance at the geothermal facilities and includes a description of the vapor recovery and evacuation units in"

The RMP includes additional safety measures to reduce the risk of damage from release of this flammable substance.\r\n\r\nThe RMP includes the specifications for the safe handling of both regulated substances and describes the training programs for employees, operators, emergency responders, and contractors on site. It summarizes the inspection and preventive maintenance programs for the isopentane delivery, storage, and describes the compliance audits, management of change procedures, and pre-startup reviews for these regulated substances. There have been no modifications to the offsite consequence analyses that modifies the population impacted, or vulnerability zones. \r\n\r\nWith the implementation of the Ormat Nevada, Inc. safety and operating procedures described in the RMP, there have been no reportable accidents at Heber 1 and Heber 2 in the five years since the last RMP was prepared. No reportable accidents occurred in the previous five year RMP update either. No releases of isopentane at the facilities have resulted in death, injury, or substantial damage to onsite facilities nor have any releases of isopentane caused offsite evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nOrmat-Nevada, Inc. has an Emergency Action Plan in place, which contains written procedures to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response and has ensured response actions have been coordinated with the local fire department and hazardous materials response agencies.  Ormat-Nevada, Inc. submits appropriate documentation to the applicable agencies in regards to chemicals and associated quantities as to be included in the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nOrmat-Nevada, Inc. is submitting this RMP to the Department of Toxic Substances Control, the Unified Program Agency (UPA) or Administrating Agency (AA) for the CalARP Program."
