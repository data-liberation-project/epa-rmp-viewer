THE ACTIVITY OF THIS PLANT INVOLVES THE STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF THE PRODUCT.\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED IS 79,000 LBS. WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A RELEASE AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE POTENTIAL QUANTITY RELEASE COULD BE 79,000 LBS., WHICH IS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE AT 85% - AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS AS WELL AS COMPANY POLICY. DISTANCE TO END POINT IN A WORST CASE SCENERIO IS 1.89 MILES FROM OUR PLANT.\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENERIO BASED ON INDUSTRY INFORMATION COULD BE A RELEASE FROM A PIPE BREAK OR TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT FOR THAT SITUATION WOULD BE .83 MILES.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS RESULTING IN INJURY, DEATH, EVACUATION, SHELTERING IN PLACE, OR OTHER EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.\nOUR EMERGENCY PLAN IS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE RISKS TO EMPLOYEES, THE SURROUNDING PUBLIC, AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. OUR COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL INVOLVED IN THIS INDUSTRY TO IMPROVE AND IMPLEMENT ANY NEW PROCEDURES AND ADVICE FOR THE BETTERMENT AND INTEREST OF SAFETY."
