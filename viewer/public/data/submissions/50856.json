      "SummaryText": "Southern Power Company's Plant Harris, located near Prattville, AL is a 2-unit combined cycle electric generating plant.\n\nPlant Harris has a Selective catalytic Reduction (SCR) System at both Units 1 and 2 to control emissions of nitrogen oxides generated from burning gas to produce electricity.  As part of the system, vaporous ammonia is injected into the flue gas that aids in the chemical reaction to convert NOx to harmless nitrogen and water vapor.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on the plant site for use in the SCR system.  \n\nThe main hazard associated with the ammonia at Plant Harris is a toxic hazard.  Based on EPA criteria, the worst case scenario would be the catastrophic failure of one of the 18,000-gallon ammonia storage tanks.  This would result in ammonia gas traveling 1.4 miles before reaching its endpoint.  However, this type of failure is extremely unlikely due to the safeguards described in the prevention program.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is considered to be due to a fault in the piping leading to a release.  A failure of this type would result in ammonia gas traveling <0.1 km before reaching its endpoint.  There are numerous mechanical and procedural safeguards at the plant to prevent this from occurring.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program at Plant Harris is focused on the safe management of anhydrous ammonia.  The first step in the prevention program was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include:  accessibility, ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventative Maintenance procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified and oriented to the site hazards; and ensuring periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations are conducted including resol"

In addition, the plant has in place an emergency action plan that includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  The procedures cover the following:  evacuation plan; recognizing emergencies; emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; first aid procedures; notifying the public and local emergency response agencies; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities an documenting releases; emergency alarm system; training; and pre-emergency coordination with the Autauga County LEPC."
