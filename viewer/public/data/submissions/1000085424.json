The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. Finally, both CalOSHA and OSHA regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM/CalARP to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Many state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications. Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM/CalARP. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team to mitigate the release. Foster Farms will rely on community responders for medical assistance and public evacuation or protection in place, if necessary. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED COMPOUNDS HANDLED\n\n\n\nFTP 2 is located at 711 F Street "

      "SummaryText": "in Turlock, California. The facility was constructed in 1978 and purchased by Foster Farms from the Grange Company in 1982. Operations at the facility consist of further processing, fabrication, and packaging of poultry deli products. The facilities are located on approximately 2 acres bordered by 8th Street to the west, Americold cold storage to the east, Valley Fresh Inc. to the north, and F Street to the south. The properties surrounding the facility have industrial businesses to the east and north and residences to the south and west of the facility. The Foster Farms facility is surrounded by a security fence, prohibiting unauthorized access. Additionally, the entrance to the facility is staffed by plant security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system at the facility. The system provides cooling for production areas, storage areas, freezers, and water chilling. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls. Ammonia is used as the heat transfer medium in the refrigeration system. As the ammonia passes through heat exchangers in the various refrigerated areas or units, heat is transferred to the ammonia thus cooling the air, water, or product that is giving up heat. The ammonia is then compressed and passes through a condenser where the ammonia gives up heat to air and water. The ammonia then cycles back through the heat exchangers to repeat the process. Anhydrous ammonia is a commonly used industrial refrigerant due to its relatively efficient heat transfer characteristics.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.

The Foster Farms ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. The major pressure vessels in all of the systems at FTP 2 are connected to a diffusion panel. Ammonia from the vessels can be mixed with water (neutralized) and discharged to the sewer system to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels. Further, all pressure vessels in all the systems are equipped with pressure relief valves. \n\n\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility include: \n\n?    Emergency shutdown systems\n\n?    Component specific safety shutdowns\n\n?    Ammonia leak detection system installed in engine room and production areas\n\n?    A solenoid operated king shut off valve activated by the ammonia detection system\n\n?    Component specific safety shutdowns and the ammonia leak detection system sound alarm locally and to the security department at Foster Farms' headquarters in Livingston, California \n\n?    Ammonia pipes, valves and components are labeled\n\n?    Pressure relief valves (PRV) are replaced at least every 5 years\n\n?    All PRVs are connected to a relief header which discharges to a water filled tank \n\n?    Fire alarm and sprinkler system throughout the plant\n\n?

      "SummaryText": " Foster Farms has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system. Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lock-out/tag-out program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP auditing and inspection program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared and are being reviewed for the ammonia system at the facility. The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\n\n\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system. A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of equipment in the ammonia system. The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe RMP/PSM/CalARP regulations require a discussion of accidents involving a release of a reportable quantity (RQ) of ammonia that have occurred at the facility within 5 years or that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within 5 years of the request for submitting the RMP.

The Foster Farms ERP is based on an emergency operations organization in which the Incident Commander serves as the chief officer in emergency situations.  The Incident Commander will take charge of the emergency response and response team and direct all operations when an emergency is declared and will remain in charge until the emergency is ended.  The ERP addresses ammonia specific issues as required by the RMP/PSM/CalARP standards, including a determination of incidents that constitute an emergency.\n\n\n\nFoster Farms has developed the ERP to assure compliance with RMP/PSM/CalARP requirements. The Plant Manager will maintain the ERP.  Additionally, a copy of the ERP will be kept with the RMP/PSM/CalARP documentation and at other appropriate locations. Refer to the ERP, for further information regarding emergency planning and response.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nFoster Farms recognizes that the RMP/PSM/CalARP is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farm continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Foster Farms will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM/CalARP, related attachments and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Foster Farms' internal review practices and Foster Farms will maintain the most current versions on site. Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM/CalARP, related documents and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies.\n\n"
