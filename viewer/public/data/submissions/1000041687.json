      "SummaryText": "The San Antonio Retail Support Center South is grocery related products storage and distribution facility that contains refrigerated areas.  The refrigerated areas are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available.  However, the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community. The refrigeration system in this facility has an inventory of up to 11,334 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\n    The Accidental Release Prevention Program does not guarantee against an accidental release.  An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The worst case scenario considered the loss of 700  pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system over a 10 minute period.  The analysis showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately 0.3 miles.  There are approximately 1015 residents which could be potentially affected in the identified radius.  There are other public receptors (schools, recreational areas, day cares, and industrial/commercial buildings) in the potentially affected area.\n\n\n\n     The alternative release scenario, which is the most likely scenario, considered a release of ammonia from a failed valve inside the building.  A release of 500 pounds of ammonia over a 15 minute period was considered.  The computer model showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately <0.1miles.  There are no residents, but other public receptors (industrial/commercial buildings) are located in the potentially affected area.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were used to limit the chemical release distances for either scenario.\n\n\n\n    The San Antonio Retail Support Center South has an established Emergency Acti"

      "SummaryText": "on Plan to respond to emergencies.  The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan.  The plan requires employees to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area.  The emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency.  The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors.  Maintenance personnel will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency.  The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and utility outages.\n\n\n\n    This location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years.\n\n        \n\n    The San Antonio Retail Support Center South wanted to evaluate the potential failures of the refrigeration system, and if the safeguards were sufficient to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  An updated Process Hazard Analysis was completed on the refrigeration system on January 13, 2014.  Planned changes to improve safety resulting from this analysis are documented in the Process Hazard Analysis report in the Accidental Chemical Release Prevention Program.  Also, the guidelines from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) will be followed where applicable, to manage the refrigeration system."
