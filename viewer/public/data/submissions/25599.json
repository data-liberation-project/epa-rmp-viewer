The health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities and prevention of pollution are among polycell primary concerns. Polycell is committed to providing safe work conditions for our employees, to promoting the safe design, use and handling of Polycell products and to comply with the laws relating to the protection of the environment. Each employee is expected to promote these goals in their tasks.\n\nThe Polycell Biola facility manufactures polyethylene foam products used as packing material polyethylene foam sheets, planks, rounds are prouced using an exturder. The exturder performs three distinct funcations: melts and plasticizes the polyethyene, disperes and mixes the blowing agent with poluethlene, and cools the mixture sufficiently to prevent cell collapse when the material is extruded through the dies. Polyethylene resin pellets are melted in the extruder. The blowing agent is pumped into the extruder under pressure. Once the polyethlene/ blowing agent mixture leaves the dies, and the mixture is no longer under pressure, the blowing agent is stored in a approved pressure vessel as non-odorized liquid petroleum gas under pressure 125 psi max. The liquid is pumped at low pressure to the high pressure metering system controls which controls the flow of the blowing agent into the extruder.\n\nThe facility has one blowing agent tank it is rated for 250 psi and has a water capicity of 15,768 gallons.\nThe worst case release scenarios and the alternative scenarios:\n\nA flammable worst case scenario assumes a butane vapor cloud explosion using EPA rmp-comps guidance for a propane storage facility. The calcilated endpoint distance with the release of the full storage vessel (65,224 lbs) with a 1psi endpoint is 0.03 miles or (1584 ft). The estimated residental population within the distance is 90 people. The likelyhood of a vap"

As an alternate scernio, we have considered the repture of a pipe with a release rate of 736 pounds per minute for 10 minutes crating a vapor cloud explosion. The estimated distance to  1 psi over- pressure endpoint would be 0.01 miles or (264ft). The estimated resdental population would be 15 people.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and prevention step:\nA) Employees education and training.\nB) All employees recieve initial and yearly refresher training in our hazardous commutation program, nd      spill responce plans.\nC) Incident investigation procedures are followed to address areas of concern.\nD) An emergency action plan is used to document and train employee to handle non-routine situations.\nE) Daily inventory reconiliations of the blowing agent tank are conducted.\nF) Maintenance personnel physically inspect the blowing agent system each shift ( 2- times per day) and inspect the hazardous material storage area.\nG) The blowing agent equipment is equipped with electronic sensors which are monitored 24 hours per day by plant personnel and a private security firm.\nH) The blowing agent tank are coated with a 2 hour rated fire protective material.\nI )  The blowing agent equipment and tank is protected by an assortment of physical barriers.\nJ)  The blowing agent equipment and tank are installed under the recommendations of the National Fire Protection Association Codes 58 and 70.\n\nThe five year accident history.\nWe have had no accidental releases of the blowing agent in the past five years. An accidental release is a spill of 500 pounds or more of the blowing agent.\n\nPloycell Packaging Corp- Biola has developed this emergency action plan tp ensure employee safety from fire and other emergencies.
