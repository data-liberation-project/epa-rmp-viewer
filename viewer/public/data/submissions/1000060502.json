      "SummaryText": "Platte River Biogas, LLC owns and operates the Platte River Biogas (PRB) facility in Weld County, Colorado (the facility).  The facility takes organic material and adds digesting agents in a covered system to produce and capture off-gas as biogas fuel.  The facility uses a complete mix anaerobic digester system to produce biogas that gets directly injectied into a pipeline.  The anaerobic digestion system converts organic feedstock and dairy cox manure into raw biogas which is then processed into pipeline quality methane.\n\nMethane (CAS 74-82-8) is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Planning (RMP) Rule, 40 CFR 68, as a flammable substance. The RMP Rule has an evaluation threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs for methane at a single applicable site. At the PRB facility, the maximum quantity of methane stored or processed at one time is 37,000 lbs. This exceeds the 10,000 lb threshold for methane in the RMP Rule, requiring an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for methane as a flammable substance.\n\nThe facility is located in a rural area typified by generally flat terrain with essentially no obstructions to wind in and around the facility.  The facility is around 10 kilometers southeast of Greeley, Colorado and the facility's surrounding region is sparsely populated, with a maximum population density of less than one resident per acre extending 10 kilometers from the PRB property line.\n\nAs the PRB facility is subject to Subpart B of the RMP Rule and is considered a Program 1 applicable facility for methane, alternative cases are not required per the OCA guidance. Thus, the OCA for methane at the facility is complete with the presentation of the worst-case release from the covered anaerobic lagoon (CAL).\n\nEndpoint distance for these effects of a vapor cloud explosion do not depend on assumed temperature, humidity, or wind. Rather, per the OCA guidance, a TNT-equivalence model is used. If the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case s"

RMP*Comp is the US EPA developed and maintained OCA model and was designed to perform the offsite consequence analysis required under the RMP Rule using conservative methods to calculate the hazard endpoint for a release.\n\nThe distance to the 1 psi overpressure is 0.2 miles measured from the cenetr of the digesters. There are no residences and no public or environmental receptors in this 0.2 mile radius.  As the PRB facility is a Program 1 eligible facility with respect to methane, no alternative scenarios are considered and the OCA is complete."
