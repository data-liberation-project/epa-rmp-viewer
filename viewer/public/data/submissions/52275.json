Both employee are very knowledgeable about the plant and the location of all emergency equipment/response plan/MSDS. Office personnel, as well as plant employee's work together and train together in the event of an emergency. Fire Department Personnel also are involved in training and working with the employees and have assisted the District with numerous main line breaks. The FD is also given updated emergency response plans as well as all MSDS updates and have taken several tours of the plant in the event of a chlorine spill. This is a very small community and everyone works well together and are willing to assist in any emergency situation.\n\n \nPALO VERDE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT\n1065 Desert View-PO Box 185    \nPalo Verde, CA. 92266-0185     \nPhone 760-854-3519   Fax   760-854-1149\npvwaterworks@earthlink.net \n\n\nWater Treatment and Distribution Information\n\n\nThe Palo Verde County Water District Treatment and Distribution System was built in 1983 and was put into service in November of that year.\n\nTreatment Plant:\n\nIn 1989 a 7,500 gallon Tonka, horizontal filter vessel was added to the system to remove Iron & Manganese.\n\nIn the year 2000, the 125,000-gallon storage tank was removed and replaced with two (2) new 125,000-gallon, above ground tanks. The two tanks are plumbed together and are in use at the same time.\n\nThe two (2) wells (north well & south well) run on a 30,000-gallon cycle, therefore the system always has a 220,000-gallon reserve in storage.\n\nThe two (2) Booster Pumps rotate in normal use. If the PSI drops below 40 PSI, the two (2) pumps run in tandem.\n\nDistribution System:\n\nAll of the Hydrants are the same, six inch (6\u00bf) Clow 850, with 2\u00bd\u00bf and 4\u00bd outlets, branched off at 8\u00bf and 6\u00bf mains with a 6\u00bf gate valve before each hydrant.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESIGN CRITERIA:\n\nUnit:                                            Design Parameters:\n\n1.
