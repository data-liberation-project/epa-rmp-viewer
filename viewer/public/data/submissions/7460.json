The policy combines advanced technology, standardized operating procedures, personnel training requirements and a top-down management commitment to safe chlorine handling procedures.  The facility emergency response policy involves utilization of, and coordination with, off-site responders to address potential chlorine-related incidents.\n\nb) The Boyd Lake WTP is located two miles west of  Interstate highway 25 on U.S. highway 34 in Loveland, Colorado.  This peaking plant typically operates from April through October of each year (24 hours/day May through September).  When operating, the plant is manned by Colorado certified Plant Operators.  Up to six one-ton containers (12,000 lbs.) are maintained during operations in a dedicated chlorination room.  One container (2,000 lbs.) is kept on site November through March, as the plant functions as back-up to the City of Greeley Bellvue WTP during this period.\n\nc) The plant performed the required off-site consequence analysis (\"OCA\") for the agency-defined \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios.  The plant utilized the OCA guidance for chlorine published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe worst-case scenario must assume the catastrophic release over ten minutes of the entire contents of a full one-ton container of chlorine, certain atmospheric conditions and the failure of all active mitigation systems.  As permitted by the guidelines, the facility assumed the chlorine room would provide a degree of passive mitigation by slowing the release of chlorine gas to the atmosphere.  Applying the guidance, and assuming an unobstructed (\"rural\") landscape, the plant determine"

(The toxic endpoint is identified as the maximum concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.)\n\nThe facility is also supposed to identify an alternative release scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, but still result in an off-site toxic endpoint.  The plant utilized a scenario involving the rupture of 5/16 inch tubing releasing chlorine gas at a rate of 15 pounds per minute.  Applying the guidance, and assuming a rural landscape with no active or passive mitigation, the plant determined the alternative release scenario would have an off-site toxic endpoint of two-tenths of a mile (0.2 mile).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd) The Boyd Lake WTP Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the following elements:\n\nAdvanced process and safety equipment;\nA chlorine gas detector in the chlorine room that triggers at concentrations greater than 1 part per million. (The alarm consists of an alarm on the operating panel and the plant SCADA computer.);\nStandardized operating procedures;\nTraining of operators and maintenance personnel in the chlorine process;\nPreventive maintenance program for chlorine process equipment;\nPeriodic hazard review of chlorine process equipment and procedures;\nAuditing and inspection program;\nInvestigation program (which will investigate future incidents that could reasonably result in a chlorine release); and\nPersonal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus for routine container changeouts.\n\ne) No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the Boyd Lake WTP in the past five years.\n\nf) The Boyd Lake WTP Emergency Response program utilizes local Hazardous Response personnel to respond to emergenci"
