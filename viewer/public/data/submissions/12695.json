      "SummaryText": "This facility complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Verona Fire Department, through a prior agreement, and request that they respond to the emergency.  It is also our policy to evacuate all employees from the facility during an emergency.  This facility is a manufacturer of Vitreous china sanitaryware.  We use propane for a back-up process fuel in the event of a natural gas curtailment.  The system consists of two 30,000-gallon propane tanks and the associated piping, valves, burners, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The maximum amount of stored propane is 60% of capacity.  The worst-case and alternate release scenarios: the worst case scenario is failure of the two 30,000-gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities\" was used for impact determination.  The resulting distance to the endpoint is 0.5 miles which extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place."
