The depot is in Newark, New Jersey and serves as a terminal for temporary staging and storage of ICBs.  All of the IBCs stored at the site conform to the applicable standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

The IBC design is in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization, as appropriate for each container type, and meets all applicable US Department of Transportation and International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) requirements for safe transportation by truck, train, and/or shipping passage.\n\n\n\nThe design of the IBCs has been studied by the European Union's Health and Safety Executive, who has established Item Failure Rates for ISO containers.  The RMP and the associated Process Hazard Analysis with Risk Assessment has utilized these failure rates.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nIn the event of the discharge, Newark Tank Depot will follow onsite emergency"
