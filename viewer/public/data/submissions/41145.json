This facility complies with Wisconsin Comm 43 for ammonia storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to contact the Fall River Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.  This facility is a farm supply cooperative.  We store and provide for application, anhydrous ammonia fertilizer.  The anhydrous ammonia system consists of one 12,000 gallon storage tank.  The ammonia is supplied by the vendor's bulk tanker truck and is used to fill nurse tanks.  The nurse tank filling procedure is performed by our own employees.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS.  Per the EPA requirements, we performed a worst-case release scenario, and reviewed alternative release scenarios for a release of anhydrous ammonia from our storage tank system at this site.  The information was used to perform an off-site consequence analysis for both situations.  Descriptions of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, and the results of the off-site consequence analysis for both are included in Section 2 and 3 of this document.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.  This facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with Wisconsin Comm 43.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  We have never had an accident involving this chemical that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system it is our policy to notify the Fall River Fire Department and request that they resppond to the emergenc"
