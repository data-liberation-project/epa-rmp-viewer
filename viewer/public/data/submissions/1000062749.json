These resources include safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process at the Hawkville Gas Treating Facility (Hawkville or the Facility) and training of operations personnel and contractors. BHPB implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. BHPB places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection, and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspections and regularly training responsible personnel. Should a release occur, facility personnel will respond in accordance with the facility emergency response plan to mitigate impacts.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nHawkville, located in La Salle County, Texas, is owned and operated by BHPB. Hawkville is a natural gas treating plant comprised of natural gas liquid recovery and natural gas treatment and compression equipment. Produced gas and liquids are delivered to the facility from gathering systems and pipelines. The Facility process produces natural gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate. The Facility equipment operates to separate, stabilize, treat (as necessary to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide), compress (gas), dehydrate (gas), store (natural gas liquids and stabilized condensate), and transfer gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate to sales. Natural gas is transported by pipeline from the Facility, and natural gas liquids and stabilized condensate are transported by cargo tank motor vehicles. \n\n\n\nThe listed flammable substance above the threshold quantity at Hawkville i"

No regulated toxic substances are present above threshold quantity in the process. The Facility complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements and Program 1 requirements of the U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP). \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nImplementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards in the process ensures the safety of workers and the surrounding community. The Hawkville process has been designed using current equipment design codes and standards with appropriate safety controls. The process design includes control systems to maintain operating parameters, such as temperature, pressures, flow, and level. Hawkville performs a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) every five years to ensure potential hazards and understood and appropriate safeguards are implemented. Process changes at Hawkville are administered by a Management of Change (MOC) process, which ensures that impacts of the change are understood and communicated to affected personnel. Additionally, BHPB has developed a maintenance program to maintain equipment integrity. BHPB has implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety at Hawkville. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened; (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures, along with training of involved personnel, form a sy"

Safety features are incorporated into the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of Hawkville to help prevent, quickly detect, and control a release, and to reduce the consequences of a release. \n\n\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control \n\no    Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and combust releases;\n\no    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated);\n\no    Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters;\n\no    Containment areas to contain liquid releases; and\n\no    Total plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system. \n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation \n\no    Portable fire extinguishers;\n\no    Personnel trained in facility emergency response activities; and\n\no    Personal protective equipment. \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History \n\n\n\nBHPB has an excellent record of accident prevention at the Facility. There have been no large or small accidental releases resulting in injuries to site personnel or contractors, or in offsite consequences. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information \n\n\n\nBHPB maintains written emergency procedures at the Facility to protect worker and public safety and the environment. Employees are trained on the emergency procedures and the procedures are updated as needed when the process or Facility is modified. The overall emergency program for Hawkville is coordinated with the La Salle County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). BHPB has 24/7 communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., La Salle County LEPC Chairman, La Salle County Sheriff, and La Salle County Fire Department). The LEPC would assist the Facility, as requested, to notify the public, control traffic, and facilitate response to an incident. BH"
