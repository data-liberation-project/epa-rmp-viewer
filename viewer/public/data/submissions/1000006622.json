The same properties that make these chemicals valuable for making drinking water safe also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of our chlorination system and ammonium hydroxide system to control human and environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding communities.  \n\nIt is Coastal Water Authority's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  The safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at CWA and we often exceed standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of these chemicals to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction.\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at CWA.  Senior management\u00c2\u00bfs commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment. \n\nFacility Description and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Lynchburg Pump Station covers approximately 220 acres, including reservoirs.  It is located at 908 Independence Parkway North, Houston, Texas in Harris County. Our facility has increased the amount of treated water to a maximum of 600,000,000 gallons of water per day.\n\nThere is a maximum of twenty seven (27) full-time employees and one civilian at the plant site at any one time. In addition, our plant has two residences located onsite.\n\nWe presen"

These substances are present in quantities greater than their threshold quantities identified by the RMP regulation.  Therefore they are included in our risk management program.  \n\nAmmonium Hydroxide (CAS #7664-41-7):  This water treatment chemical is used in conjunction with chlorine to control biofouling within the CWA A, B and C systems.  It is received as a 25% by weight solution ammonia and water.  Deliveries are made by tanker truck to the facility where it is transferred to and stored in either of two atmospheric tanks onsite prior to use.  A concrete dike surrounds these tanks and the dike is designed to hold the contents of one tank in the event of a rupture.  The nameplate capacity of each tank is 18,000 gallons; however, administrative controls at the plant limit the capacity of the tanks to 15,000 gallons each.   The maximum amount of ammonia contained in the ammonium hydroxide solution and stored at the Lynchburg Pump Station is 67,482 pounds.  \n\nChlorine (CAS7782-50-5):  This water treatment chemical is used in conjunction with ammonium hydroxide to control biofouling within the CWA A, B and C systems.  It is received at the plant in one ton containers where the normally gaseous chlorine is stored as a pressurized liquid.  These containers are standard DOT and Chlorine Institute specified containers.  Deliveries of chlorine are made at the plant approximately biweekly.  The plant has a maximum inventory of 72,000 pounds of chlorine.  During normal operation, three to six containers (6,000 to 12,000 pounds maximum) are in service at any one time.  \n\nAccidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nCoastal Water Authority contracted with an outside engineering firm to assist in the development of a prevention program tailored exclusively to water treatment operations.  This prevention program was designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects; the primary obj"

This process is defined and explained by CWA-008.  Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance is experienced.  \n\nFormal investigations are required to be conducted by appointed teams knowledgeable in operations or equipment being investigated.  Root cause and corrective actions are also required in order to determine incident prevention steps.  Progress regarding corrective action on all investigated incidents is required to be tracked through to completion.\n\nEmergency response program\n\nCWA currently handles two regulated toxic substances (chlorine and ammonium hydroxide) above threshold quantities at the Lynchburg Pump Station.  We made a decision to not respond to catastrophic releases of chlorine or ammonium hydroxide at the Lynchburg Pump Station.  Instead, our employees have been instructed to call 911 and notify the Fire Department and LEPC, and to evacuate in the event of such a catastrophic incident.  CWA maintains a Chlorine Institute Emergency Kit B and several Scott Air Packs on-site for emergency response.  \n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule, CWA is included in the North Channel LEPC local emergency response plan under the Emergency Planning and Community"

We upgraded our chlorine sensors from one to four.  We also recently purchased, and plan to install, a halogen auto-close system for chlorine valves.  We inspected our ammonia tanks and recoated both tank interiors in 2008.  Safety depends upon our management commitment, the manner in which we handle chlorine and ammonium hydroxide, the safety devices inherent to our water treatment systems, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our employees."
