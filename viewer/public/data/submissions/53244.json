(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nONEOK operates the Bushton Gas Plant, a natural gas liquids processing facility in Bushton, KS.  Natural gas liquids are received at the site via pipeline and are fractionated into various products and stored in nearby storage caverns.  Products are sent to customers via outgoing pipeline. Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, Isopentane, and Pentane are the RMP flammable substances stored or processed at the facility (either found in various mixtures or as purity products).  There are no toxic substances present at the plant in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00bfOperating in compliance with required environmental pe"

Part of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00bfProviding overpressure relief valves on all pressurized vessels.  Additionally, level transmitters and alarms are present on all vessels in order to prevent overfilling.\n\u00bfConducting preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program to help ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a continuous flare. \n\u00bfInstalling hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the facility.\n\u00bfMinimizing the potential for a catastrophic event by providing a utility water system throughout the facility.\n\u00bfInstalling security lighting and surveillance cameras to facilitate observation of the entire facility.\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility of emergencies by manning the facility continuously.\n\u00bfProviding an evacuation alarm system in order to safely evacuate the facility during emergency situations. \n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Bushton Gas Plant has had one incident occur that is reportable under the five-year accident history as defined in the RMP regulation.  This incident occurred in December 2008 and involved the release of a flammable mixture and one onsite injury.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facili"

      "SummaryText": "ty will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Bushton Gas Plant with the Ellsworth and Rice County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Ellsworth and Rice County Sheriff Departments and the Bushton Fire Department.  The Bushton Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u00bfThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00bfThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u00bfThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\u00bfIncident Investigation procedures are in place to ensure that corrective measures are taken, if necessary, following an incident.  This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent recurrence of the incident.\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the faci"
