(ALTEC) was contracted by the City of Camden Water Treatment Plant to prepare this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for their facility in Ouachita County.  This document is a carefully thought out plan that discusses the layout and operations at the facility, the measures taken to prevent releases at the facility, and the proper actions to be taken in the event that a release does occur at the site.\n\nIn the case of an accidental release of chlorine at the Camden Water Treatment Plant, different safety devices will be used to protect the surrounding community.  A rupture would cause the chlorine alarm to sound as well as initiating the automatic vacuum system due to a vacuum loss in the line.  The initiation of the vacuum system will automatically shut down the chlorine system.  This shut down will result in the prevention of any further release.  Other safety devices included in this system include: a chlorine gas detector (sounding an alarm), a sulfur dioxide detector (sounding an alarm), a flow control valve (preventing excess chemical usage), and vacuum regulators (used to start the vacuum system).\n\nThe Camden Water Treatment Plant produces drinking water for the city of Camden, Arkansas.  Using chemicals such as chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and lime through the water treatment process produces this ?clean? water.  The first part of the process is the addition of chlorine to kill any organics that may reside in the water.  In this process a chlorine residual is created and must be removed using dechlorination (with sulfur dioxide).  Next, the water flows through a filtration system, where the lime is then introduced into the system.  The lime creates a coating around any particles in the water to make them bigger and therefore easier to filter.  After filtration, the water is then safe to drink.  The only toxic chemical that is found in this process is chlorine and is kept in two (2) one ton cylinders at the facility.  If there were a"

There will follow a general discussion of the principles discussed in the video and how they apply to the Camden Water Treatment Plant.

A test will be given to indicate the level of learning and understanding.  Every three years the personnel will go through the same program.     \n2.

These emergency contacts include: physicians/ambulances, fire department, police, power company, emergency power units, telephone company, water company, electricians, heavy equipment operators, extra labor, consulting engineers, equipment manufacturers, city officials, health department, and regulatory agencies.  If an incident were to occur, an incident investigation report is filled out to find the cause of the incident and this report is then used to determine how it could have been prevented.\n\nThe Camden Water Treatment Plant is always looking for new ways to improve safety at their facility.  Ways safety is improved include: employees attending training classes every three years and being tested on the material, investigation reports being filled out and followed up, and checklists being used for operating equipment and conducting maintenance on all equipment.  All personnel are also trained in using the chlorine kit ?B? which is used to repair the one-ton chlorine cylinders used at the facility.  Apart from personnel training, safety devices such as chlorine detectors and sulfur dioxide detectors are used to sound alarms when there is a release.  A rupture in the chlorine system would initiate the automatic vacuum system due to a vacuum loss in the line.  This shut down will result in the prevention of any further release.  \n\nThis Response Management Plan (RMP) will be implemented as described in the following report."
