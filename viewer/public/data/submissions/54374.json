The Risk Management Program is based on the API Publication 761:  Model Risk Management Plan Guidance for Exploration and Production Facilities.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Ulysses Booster Station are those included in the facility\u00bfs Emergency Response Manual (ERM) and PSM Program.  The ERM covers actions to be taken in case of an unplanned release.  The mechanical integrity section of PSM covers actions to prevent an unplanned accidental release of regulated substances.\n\nThe Ulysses Booster Station is a natural gas compression, treating, and dehydrations facility. The process consists of compressing gas from the field, treating the gas through an amine unit to remove CO2, followed by glycol dehydration.  The gas is compressed from approximately 6 psig to approximately 100 psig and delivered to an outside operator via pipeline where it is further compressed up to approximately 550 psig.  The operator redelivers the 550 psig gas back to Pioneer Natural Resources (PNR).  PNR then routes the gas through the amine contactors followed by the glycol contactor and then the gas is redelivered back to the operator where it is transported via pipeline to the Satanta Gas Plant which is located 10 miles to the east.\n\nPNR's production office for this area is located adjacent to the booster station.   The vehicles used by the production office and the plant personnel are gasoline vehicles.  The gasoline storage tank, approximately 30,000 gallons, is located approximately in the center of the facility made up by the production office and the booster station.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention measures taken are outlined in the mechanical integrity section of the PSM program for the facility.  Some of the mian components of this section that would help prevent the accidental, uncontrolle"

The ERM includes actions to take in case of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance, and uncontrollable fire and tornadoes.  The proper action includes immediately contacting the Grant County Emergency Response system, which in turn will contact other emergency response agencies to aid in controlling access to the facility by the public.\n\nThe facility has ongoing programs that help train personnel in areas that have the greatest potential for uncontrolled release of hazardous substances.  In addition to utilizing PSM for hazard assessment, safety training is done in which unsafe items are discussed and resolved."
