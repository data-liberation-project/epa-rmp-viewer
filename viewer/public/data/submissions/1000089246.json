Promoting the health and safety of co-workers, contractors, customers, and communities is the responsibility of all WTG employees.  WTG will meet all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nSt. Lawrence Gas Plant (\"St. Lawrence\"), is in Garden City, Glasscock County, Texas.  St. Lawrence is a new natural gas liquids recovery plant that will produce pipeline specification natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL, also known as Y-grade) from high pressure natural gas collected throughout the upstream gathering system.  St. Lawrence will treat and process flammable gas and liquid mixtures in an amount greater than the threshold quantity containing any of the following RMP-regulated constituents:\n\n?    Methane\n\n?    Ethane\n\n?    Propane\n\n?    Isobutane\n\n?    Butane\n\n?    Isopentane\n\n?    Pentane\n\nThe only RMP-regulated toxic constituent present at St. Lawrence, which is part of the amine treating process, is hydrogen sulfide; however, quantities at this facility are well below the threshold quantity.  St. Lawrence is scheduled for initial startup during August/September of 2020.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWTG is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for all its employees, contractors, and vendors.  The St. Lawrence Gas Plant has a detailed Emergency Response Plan and will be coordinating with the community's local responders to introduce them to the new gas plant.  Mock emergency simulations will be conducted before startup and then after site operations are consistent and stable.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe St. Lawrence process is covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Manag"

In this effort, WTG identifies opportunities to continuously improve initiatives for each PSM element.  The PSM elements are implemented to satisfy the PSM requirements and are discussed here for completeness only since St. Lawrence qualifies as a program level 1 RMP process.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nEmployee participation is the foundation block to an evergreen and integrated PSM program.  WTG's PSM program is heavily focused on this key element.  The new employees of the St. Lawrence Gas Plant have been involved during construction and now into startup and have been actively involved in the implementation of each element of PSM for this new site.  WTG incorporates employee participation in all elements of PSM and other areas of safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nComprehensive reviews of the available process safety information (PSI) have been conducted.  All PSI such as maximum intended inventory (MII), design piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs), construction codes and standards used, relief valve study, cause and effect chart, safe upper and lower operating limits, and heat and material balances have been completed.  A comprehensive electronic web-based system utilized for timely access to information has made this data available to all personnel involved with operating the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n\nA PHA team including experienced operating personnel (operations and maintenance), WTG engineers, third party engineers with the firm used to design the plant, Process Control personnel, and PSM representatives conducted the initial PHA from July 8 through July 31, 2019.  The objective of the initial PHA was to identify possible deviations from the covered process design, maintenance, inspection, or operating practices that could lead to an incident with potential"

As this was the initial PHA for a new gas plant, all action items from the PHA have been addressed during the build of the new St. Lawrence Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nWritten operating procedures that reference PSI are available.  These procedures are organized by major process areas (such as amine system, glycol system, refrigeration system, stabilization system, utilities, among others) and address initial startup, normal operation, startups, shutdowns, emergency operation, and temporary operation of the facility.  WTG has published operating procedures to the company's electronic web-based system (COMEPLI).\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):\n\nImprovements to the company's MOC procedure and associated checklists are in progress to ensure a comprehensive and easily usable program are available for all sites to use.  The MOC program will be in effect at St. Lawrence once the gas plant begins operations.  \n\n\n\nA new and extensive company PSSR procedure and checklists for applicable disciplines (electrical, instrumentation, procedures, etc.) have been developed and implemented.  This updated procedure and checklists have been used to conduct the PSSRs for the new St. Lawrence Gas Plant prior to start of the facility.
