      "SummaryText": "Facility Description:\nClinton Feed & Grain, located at 1571 Main Ave, Clinton, Iowa, is an independent Feed, Fertilizer and Chemical retailer.  Located on 12 acres on the northwest edge of Clinton county, it is bordered by farm land, small businesses and residences.  This facility stores:\n1.    Feed ? approximately 20 tons, in bulk bins and bag storage in a building attached to the office area.\n2.    Farm Herbicide Chemicals in bulk tanks surrounded by a containment dyke to the southwest of the office.  At the maximum, 5 tanks containing 1500 gal each are on site.  In addition, package herbicide products are stored in a locked warehouse to the south of the bulk storage.\n3.    Liquid Fertilizer (28% nitrogen solution) is stored in steel tanks inside a concrete containment area to the west of the chemical warehouse.  The maximum amount stored in these tanks is 200 tons.\n4.    Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in two locations at the facility.  The one permanent storage tank is located on the northeast edge of the property.  This tank holds 65,000 lobs of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The other storage location is located approximately 1000 ft to the southwest of the permanent storage tank.  This location contains only portable tanks on running gears.  The maximum capacity of any tank is 8,000 lbs.\n\nAccident Prevention Approach/Release Prevention Steps:\nClinton Feed & Grain is proud of its excellent record in the prevention of accidents relating to the handling of the equipment and substances at its facility.  The company believes that this is the result of having good qualified people, a committed equipment repair and maintenance approach, and management commitment to safety.\nIn the area of farm chemicals, in addition to the diking approach to mitigating accidental spills, the company is moving away from liquid herbicides and into dry products which are not susceptible to spills.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the product on site, which we feel is most susceptible to off site releases.

      "SummaryText": "s more effort on equipment maintenance in this area than any other.  In order to mitigate accidents in this area the company purchased land adjacent to the facility to the south to provide a storage area for portable tanks separate from the permanent tank location.  This reduces the risk from vehicle accidents to tanks as well as placing the tanks further away from residences.  In addition concrete barriers are being placed around the main tank to prevent damage due to vehicular accident/terrorism. The main storage tank valves are always locked by policy, except when in use to prevent vandals opening the valves and to reduce the risk from pipe failure.  The training and experience of the employees in the handling of this product is a major element of our excellent safety record.  This includes having the Fertilizer manager trained as a local Fire Fighter in the use of Emergency Breathing Apparatus.\n\nRelease Scenarios:\nThe Risk Management Plan submitted evaluates the risk from Anhydrous Ammonia in two separate locations on this site.\nA.    Permanent Storage Tank ?\na.    Worst-Case\nThis scenario involves the release of the entire permanent storage tank load of ammonia from a transfer hose break.  Although the total amount stored at this location may be 105,00 lbs including the portable tanks, the total release is limited to 65,000 lbs from the permanent tank.  The worse case is with the wind from the south, which moves the gas into residence areas located within a tenth of a mile from the tank.  This event will be mitigated by the elevated locations of the houses from the tank, although not included in this analysis.  After the gas passes over these 4 residence areas it then mitigates over fields before reaching any other residence.  Three businesses to the west and south are over .25 miles from the site and will see a much reduced impact from the gas release.  Since the valves to the tank are locked when not in use any accident of this magnitude would occur during working "

      "SummaryText": "hours.  As such, although not taken credit in the analysis, it would be mitigated by personnel intervention to shut isolation valves.\nb.    Alternate Scenario\nThis scenario involves the same event as in the worse-case above, however, credit is taken for excess check valve operation limiting the total release amount.  In this case, although the gas cloud is smaller it is still postulated to impact the same residences as in the worst-case.  However, 2 of the businesses to the south and west will not be impacted.\n\nB.    Portable Storage Tanks ?\na.    Worst-Case\nThis scenario involves the breaking of a pipe/valve on the largest tank.  At the present time this involves a double tank on a single running gear with 8,000 lbs capacity.  The release from the tank would be gone at about 0.42 miles which would involve only 3 businesses and one residence, since the remaining area is Clinton Feed & Grain storage and farm fields.\nb.    Alternate Scenerio\nBecause of the reduced total volume for this release area, this event would be effectively the same as the Worst-Case assumptions above.\n\nAccident History:\nClinton Feed & Grain is proud of the fact that we have had no off-site release accidents in the 7 years that the current ownership has been in charge of the facility.  In addition, there have been no anhydrous accidents on-site or off requiring medical attention or equipment unscheduled down time.\n\nEmergency Response:\nIn the event of an anhydrous release the local fire department is less than 2.5 miles from the facility and a trained fire fighter, fertilizer manager, is on site during working hours.  Personnel employed by Clinton Feed & Grain and tasked with duties involving anhydrous ammonia are trained on site by observation and training material in the proper handling of anhydrous and accident actions.  Clinton Feed & Grain maintains emergency breathing apparatus on site in accordance with the state of Iowa Fertilizer regulations.  In addition, protective devices including relief valves"
