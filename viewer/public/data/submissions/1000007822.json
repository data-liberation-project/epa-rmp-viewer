Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this plant include:\n\n\n\u00c2\u00b7\tMinimizing the possibility of fire by providing fire detectors and gas detectors throughout the plant to detect flames.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tMinimizing the possibility of fire by providing fire water monitors throughout the plant for fire fighting.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tMonitoring all the storage tanks and vessels for pressure, temperature, and liquid level.

ONEOK\u00c2\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the plant, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the plant and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Isom Plant is one of many facilities owned and operated by ONEOK.  At the Isom Plant, butane is received by pipeline and converted into isobutane.  The isobutane is shipped out by pipeline and truck.  Hydrogen is stored at the facility; however, the amount is below the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nButane, isobutane, and a flammable mixture (demethanized raw feed) consisting of ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Isom Plant in amounts above threshold quantity. There are no RMP toxic chemicals present at the plant.  Sodium hydroxide and perchlorethylene are stored on site; however, these are not listed RMP substances.
