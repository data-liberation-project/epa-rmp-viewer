      "SummaryText": "This document is the Executive Summary of Star of the West Milling Co.- Risk Management Program - for the Quincy Flour Mill of Quincy Michigan. The flourmill exists to provide a quality product to customers generally located in the upper midwest of the United States.  To do this, it is sometimes necessary to treat flour with a small amount of chlorine gas to enhance baking qualities and eye appeal of the product. Chlorine is stored in a cement block structure in a liquid form under pressure in one ton containers. Converted to gas, it is applied to flour at low rates through application equipment designed and approved for use with chlorine gas. This equipment is installed and maintained by  a trained technician furnished by our supplier. There are typically four one ton containers in this process with two being on line at any one time, an additional back-up container is stored in an adjacent block structure giving us a total maximum inventory of 10,000 pounds .To ensure the continued safe operation, this equipment and process is monitored by chlorine detection equipment and the mill crew on duty. Training and an inventory of hazardous chemical handling eqipment are maintained along with pertinent records. Cooperation with  the Branch County LEPC group, tours of the facility by neighboring fire departments and a table top with local police, fire, LEPC  and school leaders in the  communitiy bring awareness and needed planning to ensure the safety of both the employees and community. Star of the West is committed to safety of both its employees and the communities that we operate in."
