      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Jefferson Street Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored exceeds the threshold limit specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The Jefferson Street WTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed a RMP contains the following required information:\n?    A management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\n?    A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternative release scenarios and their impacts on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B);\n?    A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C); and\n?    An emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the Jefferson Street WTP.\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Jefferson Street WTP has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine.  The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there will be emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT team, in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the Laredo Fire Department.   \nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Jefferson Street WTP uses chlorine and anhydrous ammonia in the water treatment process.  \nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Jefferson Street WTP is located on the banks of the Rio Grande River, which serves as the source for raw water.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped to the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.  \nThe existing chlorine faci"

      "SummaryText": "lities at the Jefferson Street WTP consist of a storage area and process area at both the Upper and Lower Plants.  One-ton chlorine containers are housed at each storage area.  The process areas are comprised of chlorine feed equipment, including chlorinators and rotameters as well as piping, miscellaneous valves, and vacuum regulators.  On treatment plant grounds, the potential to generate a release of chlorine gas exists at the storage areas as well as the process areas. \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Jefferson Street WTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine equipment, utilizing only fully trained personnel.  The management ensures consistent operation by using disciplinary measures for operational deviations. \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Jefferson Street WTP was reviewed for the period from December 1999 through December 2004.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine occurred.  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nManagement of this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees will be trained in the initial response to a release.  The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Plant operators are required to make rounds for inspection and monitoring of the plant processes at least once every two hours.  Once a leak is detected, the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT Team will be contacted.  \nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency response training to be implemented.\nIn addition to providing emergency responders and equipment, the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT Team will assume Incident Command upon arrival at the plant. \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nBased on the hazard review and prevention evaluation completed for chlorine and ammonia, a list of act"

      "SummaryText": "ion items was developed and is being considered by Jefferson Street WTP management to implement, if feasible.  The most notable planned changes include the following: \n?    Consider the need for aauto shutoff switch.  This switch would be useful during an emergency when the chlorine or ammonia supply has to be shutoff immediately.  A remote switch would eliminate the danger associated with plant personnel having to manually shutdown the system.  Emergency shutdown procedures should be developed and implemented in the training sessions.\n?    When the plant facilities are expanded or upgraded in the futur the plant will consider the design and construction of a containment building to isolate the storage areas from the process areas.  Additional consideration will be given to the capability to chemically neutralize any accidental releases of chlorine."
