The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has many elements including hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs. An RMP is required when facilities use EPA specified chemicals at quantities within the defined criteria. The RMP substances handled at the facility are formaldehyde, methyl formate, titanium tetrachloride and chlorine.\n\n\n\nTicona Polymers, Inc., Bishop facility has two on-site partners, OXEA BISHOP LLC and BASF.  OXEA owns and operates the assets located at the Bishop facility and prepares and submits its own RMP.  As of January 1, 2017, BASF also owns and operates all its assets located at the Bishop facility.  Prior to this date, Ticona employees operated and managed the BASF facility and had previously incorporated RMP substances for BASF under the Ticona RMP.  This change in management and operation necessitated the removal of all BASF-related information from the Ticona RMP.\n\n\n\nThe information submitted in the RMP includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical descriptions, five year accidental history (which is now returned to zero with the removal of the BASF chemicals), alternate release scenario and the worst case scenario. The RMP requires covered facilities to develop a worst case scenario for a release of covered chemicals from a site, as well as a more realistic release scenario (alternate release scenarios). The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community awareness, prevention and emergency response planning, not a prediction of the probability that ei"

Covering approximately 1400 acres in southwest Nueces County, the plant produces engineering plastics, organic chemicals, and pharmaceuticals products. The plant operates around the clock, seven days a week..
