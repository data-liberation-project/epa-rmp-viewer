This ammonia is only used when a portable pipe reactor is brought onto the site to produce a 10-34-0 grade ammonium polyphosphate fluid fertilizer(approximately 2-3 times/year).  The portable reactor uses the ammonia from the strorage tanks to react with superphosphoric acid which is brought on site in rail cars.  Make-up ammmonia is added to the storage tanks as needed during the operation using nurse trucks with tank capacity of about 11,000 gallons.  The portable reactor is subject to PSM and maintains the appropriate documentation to blend with this RMP to fulfill the requirements of both regulations.  The prevention program is focused on the safe operation of the portable unit and on periodic inspecions and maintenance as required of the 2 stationary ammonia storage tanks and their associated piping.  Inspections of the tanks are directed toward detecting and reparing possible leaks prior to them resulting in a release scenario.",

If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Edwards County LEPC or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.\n\nThe primary acitivity of the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for wholesale purposes.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received and stored on site for use only by a portable pipe reactor that visits the facility about 2-3 times/ year (total time of ~10 days/year).  The portable pipe reactor is covered under OSHA's PSM and it maintains its documentation.  This documentation is blended with the site RMP information to meet the overall regulatory requirements.  \n\nThe maximum quantity ever stored on-site is 114,000 pounds that is evenly divided between two 12,000 gallon capacity tanks.  The two ammona tanks that are on-site are refilled during the operation of the portable reactor by use of a nurse truck which can carry up to 11,000 gallons of ammonia.  During the downtime between operation of the portable reactor, the tanks are kept at a fairly low inventory.\n\n\n3.  WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of one of the two permanent 12,000 gallon storage tanks due to a tank rupture.  This could result in the release of up to 45,000 # of liquid ammonia over a 10 minute period.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is the rupture of an ammonia feed hose that is being used to transfer liquid ammonia from the feed pump to the portable reactor.  This could result in an ammonia release of about 160 #/minute over a 5 miute period.  The distance to the end point is 0.2"

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American Health Standards Institute, Inc.\n\nEquipment inspection and, prior to use is emphasized.\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years at the facility; and to our knowledge no off-site concequences reported.   \n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided the state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic reviews are performed to assess the maintenance and operations to establish safe operating conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
