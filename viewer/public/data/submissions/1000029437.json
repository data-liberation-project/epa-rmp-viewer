Facility Policy.\n\n\n\n        The owners, management and employees of Aurora Elevator, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Buchanan County Emergency Management Agency, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.     Facility Information.\n\n\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n\n\n3.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n\n\n5.      Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\n\n         \n\nThere was accident with anhydrous ammonia at this facility.  It occurred April 2, 2005 and involved an employee who was bleeding off an NH3 hose.  The product that was bleeding off went on the side of the nurse tank and the employee touched his pant leg to the product.  The product on his pant leg then came in contact with his leg and causes a minor chemical burn to his leg.  The accident resulted no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.       Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\n          The facility has:\n\n\n\n           a.     A written emergency action plan, in accordance wit"
