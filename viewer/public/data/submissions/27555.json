THE FACILITY POLICY\nThe owners, management, and employees of Amber Terminal (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the facility is  prepared to work with the local police, fire, LEPC and/or any other authorities to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and distribution of liquid fertilizers.  Anhydrous ammonia is located on-site for only limited time periods.  The ammonia is brought on-site in railcars and is stored as is until an outside contractor (portable pipe reactor) comes on-site and hooks his processing machine to it.  The facility is responsible for the railcar only during the time period when the railcar arrives on-site and until the outside contractor hooks to it.  After the contractor hooks to the railcar, his PSM takes over the operation and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system.\nThe maximum quantity stored on-site at any one time would be approximately 280,000 # (2 railcars).\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a railcar (140,000#) over a 10 minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to0.14 mg/L) is 4.4 miles as calculated using RMP Comp.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likey potential incident is a release from a leaking valve due to mechanical failure or having been left partially open by an unauthorized person (during a thieft of ammonia for drug production)  A total of 1000 # pounds of ammonia could be released from a railcar over a period of 10 minute.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.14 mg/L) is 0.1 miles as calculated by RMP Comp.\n\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nTh"

      "SummaryText": "e Amber Terminal is committed to preventing any losses from the ammonia railcars while they are under its responsibility.  This is accomplished by routine periodic inspections of the railcar (prior to use) to detect any leaks and/or prevent any vandalism.\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the pst five years that:\n-  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor\n\n-  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite death, injuries, evacuations, shelting in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has:\na.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.38\n\nb.  a written energency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nc.  provided state and local authorities the emercency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
