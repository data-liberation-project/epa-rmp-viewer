This written program establishes safety procedures associated with the covered dimethyl ether storage process at the facility. \r\n\r\nStationary source and regulated substances handled: \r\nStorage/distribution of aerosol paint containing dimethyl ether. The ColArt facility, located in Piscataway, New Jersey, is an artist paint and supply storage and distribution warehouse which receives, stores and packages for shipment, various art supplies including small containers, i.e.spray cans, tubes of artist paints and other art based supplies.  Facility operations do not include bulk liquid paint handling, piping, or pumping operations and no large paint containers are handled or stored.  The aerosols are flammable and contain methyl ether which is used as a propellant. \r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention tips:\r\nThe aerosol products that contain dimethyl ether are stored in a caged, sprinklered area incorrugated boxes on pallets. The facility has established accidental release prevention program procedures under the NJDEP TCPA program. \r\n\r\nFive-year accident history: \r\nThere have been no accidents or releases in the past five-years that meet the accident history criteria.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nIn an emergency ColArt employees will not perform emergency response activities. The facility's alarm system (maintained by EPIC Security) would alert the fire department.  The Bureau of Fire Prevention (Piscataway, NJ) has inspected the facility. \r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\nProcedures have been updated to reflect operations at the new facility. Recommendations were developed during the recent Process Hazard Analysis that was conducted on 1/25/2019.  The o"

The worst-case scenario in this submittal considers a release from the largest vessel on-site containing the regulated substance.  The largest vessel is a 400-ml aerosol can and contains approximately 200 mL of dimethyl ether."
