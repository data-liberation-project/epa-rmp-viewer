Specifically, Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in quantities exceeding the threshold quantities listed in the EPA RMP standards. West Isle Production has developed a management system for the RMP program, performed a Process Hazard Analysis, developed prevention program elements and formulated an emergency response plan. If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The emergency response plan has been developed\nand would be implemented in the event of a release.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe following activities occur at the facility:\na. The production of Ammonium Polyphosphate (NAICS Code 325311 - Nitrogenous Fertilizer\nManufacturing).\nb. Receiving and storage of Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7). Anhydrous Ammonia is received by bulk tanker truck and stored in two 30,000-gallon capacity aboveground storage tanks.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nWest Isle Production has comprehensive written programs and procedures to comply with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) regulations.
