Hilmar has a comprehensive line break procedure and has additional safety valves on all oil draining locations (self-closing valves).  This facility has a water diffusion system for accidental vapor releases.\n\nEmergency Response:  Hilmar Cheese Company maintains an emergency response team that all members have been trained to the technician level as described in 29CFR 1910.120q.  Hilmar Cheese Company also has several employees that are qualified to take charge of any emergency response occurring at this facility.\nTraining:  Hilmar Cheese Company employees working on or around the ammonia system are trained in:\n\n\u00bf\tMOC procedures.
