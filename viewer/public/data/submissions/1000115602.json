System 1 Condensers and Penthouse Evaporators are mounted on Engine Room #1's roof, and the Evaporators/Coil Units are located in their respective cold/freezer storage areas. \nEngine Room #1's refrigeration cycle begins with the collection of high pressure liquid ammonia in the High Pressure Receiver from the Condensers.  The High Pressure Receiver serves as the main liquid storage vessel for system 1.  The High Pressure Receiver provides high pressure liquid ammonia to the Pre-cool Pump Package, Belt Freezer (IQF #9), Poly Bag Room Evaporators, and Intercooler.  The High Pressure Receiver also provides liquid injection, for oil cooling, to High Stage Compressors HSC-8, HSC-9, and HSC-10 and Booster Compressors. High Stage Compressors HSC-11, HSC-12, and HSC-13 are water cooled.\n\nHigh pressure liquid ammonia passing through the Intercooler is provided to the Pump Package 13 (PP-13), Freezer Pump Package (PP-12), Sure Fresh Pump Package, Berry Cool Pump Package, and when needed, system 2.  Suction from these areas is drawn off by the Booster Compressors and Suction Accumulator/LTU prior to entering the High Stage Compressors.  Booster Compressor discharge is routed to the Intercooler. Suction from the Poly Bag Room passes through the Suction Accumulator/LTU prior to entering the High Stage Compressors.  After a predetermined amount of liquid has accumulated in the Suction Accumulator\u0092s Transfer Unit, the Transfer Unit opens the high pressure hot gas line, forcing the accumulated liquid out of the vessel and into the High Pressure Receiver.\n\nSystem 1 has a total of 52 Evaporators/Coil Units plus a Freeze Tunnel.

Senior management as well as Human Resources administer the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSure Fresh Produce has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Sure Fresh Produce to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\nThe majority of the equipment is located inside the engine rooms.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility is located in a rural area at 1315 South Blosser Road, in Santa Maria, California, which is approximately 2.0 miles east of Highway 101, and approximately 0.2 miles south of Highway 166.  The facility's ammonia system operations began in 1956 and expanded in 1980; with Sure Fresh Produce occupying and handling ammonia operations as of 2021. The facility made modifications to the ammonia system in 2020-2021 including the replacement of a Liquid Transfer Unit (LTU-4), installation of a Low Pressur"

At the time of construction and facility expansion, the ammonia systems were constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe facility has one ammonia refrigeration system onsite, which acts as two separate refrigeration systems onsite. The two systems are connected via one ammonia liquid and one ammonia suction line.  Unless the facility is transferring liquid from system 1 to system 2, the connection lines are normally closed. The total charge of the ammonia systems (combined) was calculated by refrigeration contractor, APPCO, in 2012, and updated in 2021 by Hawkins Engineering. The total charge was found to be 56,145 pounds of ammonia (System 1 - 42,247 & System 2 - 13,898).\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems (System 1 & System 2) at Sure Fresh Produce are connected via one ammonia liquid line and one ammonia suction line.  Unless the facility is transferring liquid from system 1 to system 2, the connection lines are normally closed, and the systems function independently. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems (System 1 & System 2) cycle the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.

The System 2 Compressors and Condenser cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  \nEngine Room #2's refrigeration cycle begins with the collecting of high pressure liquid ammonia in the High Pressure Receivers (2) from the Condenser.  The High Pressure Receivers serve as the main liquid storage vessels for system 2.  The High Pressure Receivers provide high pressure liquid ammonia to Economizers/Subcoolers and liquid injection to Compressors #1, #3, #5, #7 and #8 .  The Economizers/Subcoolers provide subcooled liquid to the Sure Fresh Pump Package.  The Sure Fresh Pump Package pumps liquid to the Sure Fresh IQF where the liquid vaporizes (hence providing cooling).  The vaporized suction is returned to the Pump"

      "SummaryText": "Package.  The Accumulator protects the Compressors from directly receiving liquid.  After a predetermined amount of liquid has accumulated in the Slop Tank/Accumulator, the vessel\u0092s pump returns the accumulated liquid to the Sure Fresh IQF Pump Package.\n\nSuction from the Accumulator first passes through the Low Stage Compressors before its pressure is increased further by the High Stage Compressors. The High Stage Compressors discharge through a common header to the Condenser where the gas is condensed to a high pressure liquid and then drained back to the High Pressure Receivers.  Oil from system 2 is collected and drained via Engine Room #2's Oil Purge Tank. \n\nThe System 2 refrigeration system contains 13,898 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nAll process equipment and piping for System 1 and System 2 are of stainless steel construction.  Ammonia piping is designed according to ASME standards. \n\nAll ASME vessels within System 1 and System 2 are equipped with pressure relief valves rated to relieve at either 150, 250 psig, or 300 psig. System 1 and System 2 pressure relief valves relieve to the Diffusion Tank.\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Sure Fresh Produce ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems are inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation, the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to regularly maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine rooms and throughout the facility.  In case of ammonia detection, an offsite monitoring station receives an alarm and then proceeds to alert the facility.\n\nIn the event of a power fail"

      "SummaryText": "ure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shutdown, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibility of any ammonia releases.\n\nThe systems also incorporates pressure relief valves.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to the Diffusion Tank via relief lines.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately by the refrigeration contractor.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, IIAR Standard 6 - 2019.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\"\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\nOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or \nKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\"\n\nFormer facility tenant, Sunrise Growers experienced a small ammonia release on October 10, 2018. A cold storage employee reported an ammonia release to refrigeration operators. It was determined that a pressure relief valve (#1017) on the Berry Cooler Pump Room vessel was leaking by. All facility personnel evacuated following the facility's Emergency Action Plan procedures. Local first res"

      "SummaryText": "ponders were contacted and arrived on scene, however the release was contained by facility operators and no response actions were performed by the fire department. No personnel onsite nor employees were injured, nor needing medical intervention.\n\nAn incident investigation was conducted where the recommendation was to switch the three-way valve to operate on the backup pressure relief valve, and the faulty pressure relief valve was taken out of service and replaced. The release lasted approximately 5 minutes, and released approximately 25 pounds of ammonia.\n\nAn incident investigation was conducted where an ammonia release occurred on May 27, 2020. Viking pump pp2 had a leak of ammonia at the suction valve. The release lasted approximately 20 minutes, and released approximately 10 pounds of ammonia. \n\nSince change of ownership and occupying of the facility (February 2021), Sure Fresh Produce has not had any 5-Year accidents as defined by EPA RMP.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSure Fresh Produce is subject to OSHA regulations, 29 CFR 1910.38, and state EPCRA Rules of Laws. They have an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. The Emergency Action Plan was last updated on March 1, 2021. Sure Fresh Produce provides Emergency Action Plan training for all employees, and routine drills are conducted and documented on an annual basis.\n\nEmergency response activities are coordinated with the County of Santa Barbara Fire Department ((805) 681-5500) and the City of Santa Maria Fire Department (Fire Station #1 (805) 925-0951 Ext. 2257).  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the Department of Public Safety Emergency Management Services.
