If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the local Fire Department ( a 911 call ) and request a response to the emergency. This call would also notify the Clayton County Sheriff's office.  A follow up call will be made to the office of the County LEPC.

Members of the local fire and police departments are encouraged to become familiar with our location and facilities, enabling them to more quickly asses any necessary response procedures.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nOur overall plan is to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working with the anhydrous ammonia system make routine observations and inspections prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks, enabling them to detect problems early before they can cause a hazardous situation.  Empoyees are trained regularly to recognize areas of potential hazards and new hires are trained immediately and observed to determine their level of comprehension and understanding.  The company makes every effort to cooperate with local, state, and federal officials as they endeavor to assist us with our anhydrous ammonia operation."
