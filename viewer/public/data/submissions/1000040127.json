      "SummaryText": "The California City Wastewater Treatment Facility is an extended aeration, tertiary wastewater treatment plant with a maximum design capacity of 1.5 million gallons per day and an instantaneous flow of three million gallons per day. The current inflow average is 530,000 gallons per day.\n\n\n\nPreliminary treatment consists of two submersible chopper pumps located in the influent lift station, an automated bar screen with washer/compactor and flow totalizer. Primary treatment consists of one aeration basin split into two cells with divider wall and split flow between cells with two surface aeraton units per cell. Secondary treatment consists of two secondary clarifiers with split flow and an RAS/WAS station with chopper pumps and flow monitoring meters. Tertiary treatment consists of a secondary lift station with two submersible pumps with flow meter and totalizer, flocculation chamber, four sand filtration units, and chlorine contact chamber with a two hour contact time.\n\n\n\nThe RMP/CalARP regulated portion of the wastewater treatment facility is the chlorine storage, injection system, chlorine scrubber and piping. In principal, the control system monitors flow downstream of the filter influent pumps to correctly meter the injection of chlorine at the in-flow of the chlorine contact chamber. Chlorine is stored in one ton D.O.T. cylinders in the chlorine storage room. A maximum of two chlorine cylinders are connected to the injection system with one cylinder active and one cylinder in reserve. Chlorine gas is extracted from the cylinders under vacuum by virtue of chlorine vapor pressure and the venturi created by the chlorine injection pump or by water pressure using CL2/H2O solution mix, both injection systems located at the in-flow of the chlorine contact basin.\n\n\n\nThe City of California City Wastewater Treatment Plant was commissioned in 1993 and the chlorine injection system in 1995. The process is regulated by Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous "

This is a RMP/Cal ARP Program Level 3 facility. The facility has implemented the prevention program described below.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program is based on the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 and Title 19 CCR 2735 and includes the following: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nTraining includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, emergency response, hotwork permit procedure, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures. Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with process safety management audits, every three years, and revalidation of the process hazard analysis, every five years.\n\n\n\nThe facility stores and unloads chlorine. There are four - one ton DOT cylinders with a capacity of 2,000 pounds each. The tanks are administratively controlled to hold 95% maximum capacity.Only one tank is operating at any given time; therefore the worst case toxic scenario is based on a 2,000 pound release. The DOT cylinders are stored in a secure structure.\n\n\n\nThe City of California City maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source, activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, activate the chlorine scrubber, contact 9-1-1, and secure the area.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine injection system is housed in a secure building with an emergency chlorine scrubber unit in the even"

      "SummaryText": "t of a release.\n\n\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release. This information was verified by the reviewing of records from the Kern County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency. \n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on the guidance document provided by the Environmental Protection Agency Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants. The worst case release scenario and alternate release scenario were based on chlorine as the modeled substance. The worst case release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas and indicates a 3 ppm end point distance of 2.3 miles. This distance impacts public receptors of an adjacent farm, chemical storage facility, and a resident population of 500.\n\n\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for this process is a break in the chlorine injection transfer connection. This scenario could result in the release of 825 pounds of liquids over a ten minute period. The maximum distance for this scenario is 0.4 miles. The process maintains mitigation measures consisting of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and chlorine scrubber unit.\n\n\n\nThe City of California City has a commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of covered processes. City of California City's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release."
