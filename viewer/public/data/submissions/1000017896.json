This type of information was developed for the evacuation of populated areas in the event of a major chemical or gas release. \n\nTo improve our existing safety program Community Water System requested that our insurance carrier provide an onsite review of all safety training and any potential problems or deficiencies in our program.  This survey was conducted by an Approved Professional Safety Source (APSS) provided by our carrier.  \n\nThe first review was made in June 1999.  Initial conversations with this professional indicate that review and implementation will cover a six-month period.  During that period of time a complete investigative review was made with time allowed for implementation in any areas found to need corrective action. The plan was adopted by Community Water System and a copy was given to the Cleburne County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) for their files.\n\nCommunity Water System is dedicated to the preservation of health, safety and welfare of its employees as well as its neighbors.  The Board of Directors and Management of Community Water System have and will remain cognizant of Risk Management and will continue to review all aspects of its operation.\n\n\nChanges to Emergency Response Program\n\nIn an effort to be ready to respond to chemical releases resulting from equipment failure, accidents or natural disasters, Community Water System will continue to conduct pertinent training exercises throughout the year.  As technology improves and alternate less harmful processes become available, Community Water System is committed to move toward safer and less hazardous operations.\n\nWithin the next five years, Community Water System plans to convert from gaseous chlorine to liquid sodium hyp"

In 1989 under Title III, the Office of the County Judge, Cleburne County, Arkansas, ordered an Emergency Response and Hazardous Material Spill Emergency Plan be developed, and implemented.  The purpose of this plan was to develop a list of companies, businesses, factories and facilities that stored or maintained chemicals, fuels, gases or other substances that were identified as Hazardous.\n\nThe Emergency Response Policy required a Response Plan be filed with the County. This plan was developed through the Cleburne County Committee formed under Title III.  The Committee addressed the following areas and detailed how each of the responsible agencies was to react.  The responsible agency is the Office of Emergency Management, Cleburne County, Arkansas.  The following areas were included but not limited to the following:\n\n1. Communications\n2. Prompting Form\n3. Prompting Form Response Vehicles\n4. County Emergency Operations\n5. Emergency Equipment\n6. Health and Medical\n7. Health and Medical Resources\n8. Health and Medical Organization Chart\n9. Incident Report\n10. Shelters\n11. Law Enforcement\n12. Hazardous Materials - Transportation Routes and Maps\n13. Direction, Control and Communications\n14. Emergency Public Information\n\nCommunity Water System is a part of this countywide plan and was instrumental in its development as our facility uses and stores chlorine gas and other less hazardous chemicals.\n\nOn site safety for loading, unloading, handling and use of 150-pound cylinders of chlorine gas have been addressed in our written plan for all locations where they are kept and stored.

The Board of Directors and Management of Community Water System have adopted a company policy for implementation of these guidelines and were made a part of the CWS Loss and Safety Manual. \n\nLocation of Facility\n\nCommunity Water System (CWS) has Water Treatment Facility located on the shoreline of Greers Ferry Lake.  The 911 address is 299 Lakeshore Drive, Greers Ferry, Arkansas, 72067.  CWS provides water to both retail and wholesale customers.  Our retail system provides water to a population of approximately 16,912 customers and the wholesale population served is approximately 54,171.  \n\nFacility Operation\n\nRaw water is drawn from the Greers Ferry Lake via an intake structure located along the shore of the lake.  The intake structure consists of four (4) submersible pumps that are capable of delivering 2100 gallons per minute each.  The water is then pumped to two separate treatment plants for processing.\n\nAs raw water is pumped from the lake, samples are taken and tests are run to determine the amount of chemical to be added for proper flocculation and sedimentation.  The addition of lime and polymer (PAC 950) are added in the flash mixer. The water leaves the flash mixer and then travels to the Claricones for settling.  Prior to entering the Claricones anionic is added at the base of the Claricone along with a small amount of chlorine for algae control.  After sufficient settling time the water then flows to a bank of twelve anthracite and sand filters were particulates are further removed.  From the filters the water is chlorinated and flows to two storage tanks with a total volume of 2.5 million gallons.  Water from these tanks is piped to the High Service Building and then pumped from this building to either the retail or the wholesale transmission systems.  The capacity of the conventional pl"

This plant is capable of producing 4.0 million gallons of finished water per day, giving CWS a total water treatment capability of 10,000,000 gallons per day. \n\nCommunity Water System serves both wholesale and retail customers with a distance across the service area of approximately 55 miles and has 20 ground or elevated water storage tanks with a combined capacity of 8.4 million gallons. There are 12 pump stations located within the retail service area of approximately 208 square miles.  There are approximately 361 miles of transmission lines, which serve an estimated population of 71,000 customers. \n\n\nChemicals Used and Stored\n\nChlorine gas storage is in 150-lbs. gas cylinders.  Under normal operating conditions a sixteen (16) bottles will be on hand for a total capacity of 2,400 pounds of actively stored chlorine gas. \n\nLime storage capacity is 42,000 lbs.\n\nPAC 950P (polymer) storage capacity is 45,000 lbs.\n\nAnionic (polymer) storage capacity is 2,200 lbs.\n\nCaustic Soda storage capacity is 14,000 lbs.\n\nOrtho-Phosphate capacity is 12,000 lbs.\n\nCitric Acid capacity is 100 gallons.\n\nSodium Hypochlorite capacity is 1590 gallons.\n\nBio-Sulfite capacity is 100 gallons.\n\nHazardous Materials listed above include only CHLORINE.  However, any of the above chemicals may cause burns to the skin and may cause eye irritation with prolonged contact. All of these chemicals should be avoided, and should be handled by trained personnel only.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nCommunity Water System is proactive in its efforts to prevent chemical releases of any kind.  Company policies and training are an important part of this accident prevention training.  However, training to deal with accidental releases and repairs is also an essential part of the prevention training.\n\nAs part of an ongoing commitment to a safe work environment, Community Water System conducts m"

Should a leak be detected, responding personnel must obtain a permit from the front office before entering the area or commencing repairs.  Two persons must be present at all times with one person outside of the containment area.
