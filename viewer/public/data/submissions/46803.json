The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the Costco Warehouse's PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nCostco maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nCostco Warehouse has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Laredo Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Warehouse to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nCostco Warehouse will begin operation of the facility upon its completion in November  2002.  The ammonia system at Costco Warehouse consists primarily of vessels, compressors, a condenser, evaporators and associated piping.  The majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nThe Costco Warehouse facility provides cold storage space and a docking area for warehouse items.  Ammonia sensors are located in the Engine Room and Warehouse that alert facility personnel and activate the ventilati"

The ammonia detection system also had the capability to shut-off all electrical power to the engine room.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 11,000 pounds.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description : Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (the High Pressure Receiver has the capacity to hold a greater quantity than the ammonia charge of 11,000 pounds) - 11,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  Since the HPR vessel is located inside, the enclosure of the building was considered a passive mitigation measure, reducing the effective release rate to the outside atmosphere by 55%.  The \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description : The alternative release scenario presented is similar to the worst case in that it is a liquid release.  The alternative release scenario chosen for this facility is that of a 0.25 inch diameter orifice leading to an airborne release, representative of a pump seal leak, a gasket rupture, pinhole leak due to corrosion, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, etc.  It is assumed that this release is from the high side of the system; therefore at a maximum pressure of 180 psig.  The release scenario is assumed to continue until the full charge is released, thereby incorporating mitigation measures such as the ammonia sensors and system shutdown.\n\nEPA allows a facility to use typical meteorological conditions at the facility. For this scenario, a wind speed of 3 mete"

This release reaches  off site.  No population or environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Warehouse ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP). \n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine room and the warehouse.  In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the computer system.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.). \n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief line.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves, via an emergrency refrigerant control box, to an outside water diffusion tank until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions "

In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBecause this is a new ammonia refrigeration system, there have been no accidental ammonia releases at the Costco Warehouse facility within the last five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Warehouse has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Laredo Fire Department and the local fire houses.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the Department of Public Safety Emergency Management Services.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center and the Emergency Spill Report Sensor will be called.\n\nCostco Warehouse maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.
