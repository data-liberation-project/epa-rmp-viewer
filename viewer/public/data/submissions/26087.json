(FC) accidental release prevention policy involves, but is not limited to technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the ANSI  K-61.1 - 1989 Safe Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, as adopted by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS), are adhered to. The FC emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n2. The FC facility at Britt is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer. This facility is used for the purpose of parking & storing a varying number of anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks with a maximum single tank capacity of 6,200 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. A maximum of ten (10) nurse tanks are stored at this facility at one time with a total ammonia capacity of 43,000 pounds. All ammonia weights were figured at 5.0 lbs. per gallon. Ammonia at 77 degrress F. weighs 5.03 lbs. per gallon. RMP Comp (TM) uses 77 degrees F. for the temperature in both the worst case and alternative case scenario calculations. All tanks were figured at 85% fill capacity. This facility is manned during normal business hours.\n \n3. The off-site consequence analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as worse case release and alternative scenario. The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at FC - Britt involves a failure on the largest"

The off-site consequence analysis for this scenario was performed by using pre-defined EPA guidelines in RMP-Comp version 1.04 software.\n\nEPA mandated meteorological conditions were determined by using RMP-Comp version 1.04 for both the worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario. \n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst-case release scenario was performed using RMP-Comp assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.40 miles. An estimate of residential population potentially affected of six (6) was obtained by counting residence within the worst case toxic circle.\n\nThe alternative scenario chosen involves vandals partially opening a liquid withdrawl valve on a ammonia nurse tank trailer in the parking lot.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for alternative scenario releases was performed using RMP-Comp assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of <0.1 miles. An estimate of residential population potentially affected of two (2) was obtained by counting residences within alternative scenario toxic endpoint.\n\n4.
