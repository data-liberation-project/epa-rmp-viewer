If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other emergency personnel to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people in our community or the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at our ammonia facility is the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from trucks into our storage tank and later into nurse tanks that are used by our farmer customers. The maximum quantity stored at our facility is 131,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. \n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is 2.41 miles. The alternative release scenario based on industry records and accident data provided by industry trade organizations would be a release from a break in a transfer hose which produces a distance to the endpoint of .83 mile.\n\nOur facility has implemented a detailed emergency response plan and we continue to work with local emergency responders to better prepare for any accidents. In addition, on at least an annual basis, we train our employees on the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia. In regards to anhydrous ammonia, our firm is heavily regulated and must meet  OSHA, EPA, DOT  and rules set forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture. All of these efforts have paid us great dividends which is evident by our excellent accident history. We have had no accidents on sight or off sight which caused any fatalities, injuries, evacuations or sheltering in place. In addition we are very concenerd with the environment and have had no significant property damage caused by anhy"
