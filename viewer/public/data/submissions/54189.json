In the event of a release, we are prepared to work with the local fire department and minimize the impact of the release on the employees, local residents, and the environment of the area.\n\nAg Service in is a ag wholesale business that sells fertilizers to dealers for resale for crop production by farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is utilized in the plant to be combined with water and phosphorus componds for mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum amount that can be stored at our facility is 53,000 lbs. or approximately 12,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia. The maximum amount  unloaded or present at our facility at any one time would be 53,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. Ag Services, Inc. also has a maxium of 139,000 lbs of Aqueous Ammonia.  \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the entire storage tank in a gas release over 10 minutes.  The amount released would be 53,000 pounds and would result in an end point of 1.63 miles and would effect a population of 117.   The Fertilizer Institute?s Degadis model was used for the end point calculations.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia would be a pipe release over 2 minutes.  The total amount released would be 11,908 pounds and would result in an endpoint of 0.83 miles and would effect a population of 30.  The Fertilizer Institute?s Degadis model was used for the end point calculations.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario for Aqueous Ammonia would be the release of the entire storage tank in a liquid that slowly turns to a vapor release over several hours.  The amount released would be 139,000 pounds and would result in an end point of 0.66 miles and would effect a population of 19.   The Fertilizer Institute?s Degadis model was used for the end point calculations.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for the Aqueous"

The Fertilizer Institute?s Degadis model was used for the end point calculations. Population was estimated using the 2000 census and population density per square mile for Marion County of 14.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program: The facility has complied with the Kansas Department of Agriculture?s Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and are inspected every year.  The plant has also done it?s best to comply with the ANSI K-61 published by the American National Standards Institute and the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s Ammonia regulation, 29 CFR 1910.111.\n\nThe 5-year Accident History: There has not been a reportable accident in the past 5 years\n\nWe have implemented and have posted at our anhydrous plant our emergency action plan for handling of anhydrous ammonia. These guidelines include response in case of fire, spills or leaks, and first aid. Employees have been trained in regards to all of these emergencies. Ag Service Inc. has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standards. We also have provided the Hillsboro Fire Department and the Marion County Emeergency Planning Commission with our community right to know imformation as required by SARA Title III.\n\nSafety is a top priority at our facility. We will continue to make periodic inspections and evaluations on the safety of our anhydrous facility."
