This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMaine Wild Blueberry's primary activities encompass Freezing and Canning and Drying of fruits. (blueberries & cranberries). We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility, ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 16,500 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMaine Wild Blueberry complies with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMaine Wild Blueberry Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nMaine Wild Blueberry conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Wha"
