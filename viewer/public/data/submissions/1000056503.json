Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThis facility handles ammonia (anhydrous), which is considered a hazardous material.  The properties of this material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle the ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThroughout the cleaning, sorting, fumigation, and processing of cherries at the Chinchiolo Stemilt California (CSC), the fruit must be preserved from deterioration by refrigeration.  Ammonia is used for this purpose.  The ammonia at CSC is completely contained within  closed loop systems at all times and should never need to be refilled with replacement ammonia at any time under normal operating conditions. An estimated 20,012 pounds of ammonia are utilized within the CSC-North refrigeration system and 18,008 pounds of ammonia are utilized within the CSC-South refrigeration system at CSC and are distributed between the hydrocoolers, the mechanical rooms, and the controlled atmosphere (CA) rooms.  The receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substance is considered as part of two complete processes.\n\n\n\n3a.  Administrative Controls\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia systems and the training provided to the ammonia operators.\n\n\n\n3b.  Mitigation Measures\n\n\n\nMitigation measures "

The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the ammonia system and its related equipment and components. Both CSC-North and CSC-South have water filled diffusion tanks which can be used for emergency pressure relief and capture of any PRV releases.\n\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of ammonia within the past five years at the facility.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Linden Peters Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The San Joaquin County Environmental Health Department may incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 4 Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCommitments made under the Process Safety Management (PSM) are implemented as scheduled by the company.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated ammonia process system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental rele"
