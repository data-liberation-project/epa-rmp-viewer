Utilize written job procedures involving handling of chlorine. 2. All BWA Personnel annually review written procedures. 3. All operations and maintenance personnel are trained (in-house and TECQ classes).  4. All operations and maintenance personnel obtain and maintain a \"C\" surface water license from TCEQ. 5. All operation and maintenance personnel are annually HAZWOPER certified.  6. Chlorine gas system is vaccum from regulator on the liquid chlorine cylinder to the water aspirator.   \n\nEmegency Response policies are as follows: 1. Notify Lake Jackson Fire Dept. 2. Do not attempt a repair of a leak or rescue without self contained breathing air apparatus. 3. Evacuate all non essential personnel  4. Do not a repair alone. 5. All BWA Personnel are have required HAZWOPER training. 5. All maintenance and operations BWA  Personnel are annually trained and certified on SCBA  6. All maintenance and operations BWA Personnel are Bi-Annually trained and certified in CPR and First Aid via Red Cross. \n\nb) Brazosport Water Authority maintains liquid chlorine in 2,000 pound cylinders on site for disinfection of drinking water.\nChlorine maximum amount is 24,000 pounds\n\nc) Worst Case release scenario for:\n   1.
