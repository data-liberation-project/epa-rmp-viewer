All cylinders are under a shade. Chlorine injection system works under vacuum created by well water going through venturi ejector. If the water supply to ejector stops or vacuum is lost due to tube rupture or for any other reason, the spring-loaded inlet valve immediately closes and isolates the gas supply.\r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAccording to Del Mar Food Products personnel, no incident that meets the five-year accident reporting criteria (deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage) has been occurred in the past five years.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Emergency Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Emergency Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency action plan is included in RMP Binder Chapter 20.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review,"

However, threshold quantity for chlorine in the CalARP regulations is 100 lb., therefore chlorine system at the facility is subject to CalARP RMP requirements only.\r\n\r\nChlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system. Because it is heavier than air, it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials. Chlorine is detectable with measuring devices in concentrations as low as 0.2 ppm and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60 ppm. About 1000 ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system, and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. See RMP Binder Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for chlorine.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nDel Mar Food Products maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent future releases, see Chapter 14 - Incident Investigation.\r\n\r\n3.1. Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation of the refrigeration system. Maintenance is done by the qualified in-house technicians and the refrigeration contractors. They are also trained in emergency action procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the refrigeration machinery room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in engine rooms and cold rooms.

All low side vessels that are connected directly to the suction of compressor is installed with high level float switches that shuts down compressor upon detection of high liquid level in the vessel. All cold storage rooms and the refrigeration machinery rooms are installed with ammonia sensors that triggers an alarm upon detection of ammonia vapor. Exhaust fans are installed in the engine rooms.

Only one cylinder is used at a time. The cylinder in use is secured separately with chain to a support system that is anchored to the ground. The cylinder in use is connected to the chlorine feed system which injects chlorine into the well pump discharge line that supplies the facility water.
