      "SummaryText": "The Bellemeade Power Station is an electric utility generating facility, which burns natural gas and distillate oil to generate electricity. It is required, by the terms of its air quality permit, to use selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in order to comply with State and Federal air regulations. The SCR system operates by injecting ammonia into the flue gas and passing the flue gas/ammonia mixture through a catalyst which causes the ammonia to react with NOx, converting into nitrogen gas (a natural component of the atmosphere) and water. This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nBellemeade Power Station has maintained a strong safety and accidental release prevention program. The facility's ammonia storage and handling is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Bellemeade Power Station's operating procedures are written and followed with specific detail for safely conducting activities involving the unloading, storage, and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, each employee involved in operating the ammonia process is further trained in emergency operations.  Plant personnel strictly adhere to the written maintenance procedures to ensure the mechanical and functional integrity of the tank, piping system, and emergency shutdown systems.  These activities include periodic inspections, testing, and replacement of parts consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering practices.  Furthermore, Bellemeade Power Station ensures that any changes to the ammonia process or plant equipment and systems are managed by implementing a hazard analysis, a root cause failure analysis, and safety procedures before modifications occur.  Bellemeade Power Station has taken great care to ensure the anhydrous ammonia system is properly designed, maintained, and operated.  Because the ammonia storage and handling is subject to OSHA's PSM requirem"

      "SummaryText": "ents, audits and inspections are performed periodically to identify changes to improve safety.  These changes are evaluated and implemented as required by the regulation.  Chemical safety training through first aid, emergency contingency plans, Hazard Communication, and PPE programs reinforce the criticality of chemical safety to operations personnel.  The emergency response program includes the training mentioned above, both announced and unannounced annual drills, emergency horns and radio communications at the facility.  Bellemeade Power Station has confirmed our inclusion with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\n\nThe facility had a reportable release of ammonia on November 30, 2015 when a pressure release valve on a 2\" line malfunctioned.  A fire hose was manually applied to the release area, containing the ammonia within the berm.  No injuries or property damage occurred as a result of the leak, and no evacuation was necessary.  After the incident, an automatic fogging system was installed in the tank area and its operation was added to the safety training programs.\n\n\n\nIt does not (is not required to) have an emergency response plan meeting OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER); accidents that cannot be corrected immediately by employees who are within the immediate release area would be referred to the Richmond LEPC.\n\n\n\n"
