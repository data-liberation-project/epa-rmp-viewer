Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, US Foodservice has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\n\n1.1.\tCorporate Commitment to Safety\n\nUS Foodservice is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining aZero Accident Tolerance through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n1.1.1.\tIt is the policy of US Foodservice to:\n\n1.1.1.1\tProvide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\n1.1.1.2\tComply with all federal, state, and local occupational health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations.\n\n1.1.1.3\tProvide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\n\n1.1.1.4\tEnsure, through training, and when necessary disciplinary action, that all employees"

In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n1.1.4.\tUS Foodservice has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established and implemented regarding the ammonia refrigeration system process.  It is the responsibility of the designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\n1.1.5.\tThe first duty of US Foodservice employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n1.2.\tUS Foodservice Facility Description\n\nUS Foodservice is a cold storage / distribution facility that receives and prepares the re-shipment of frozen and refrigerated food products to their end users.  Products are received and shipped via truck 24 hours a day, six days a week.\n\n1.2.1.\tThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisio"

Evacuation plans are placed throughout the facility to inform personnel in an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia, or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release; which can be found in the US Foodservice Emergency Action Plan.  These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n1.5.2.\tPlant personnel have received required emergency training as outlined in OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n1.5.3.\tThe Boca Raton Fire Department has visited the facility to review the process operations, safety systems and discussed emergency response coordination."
