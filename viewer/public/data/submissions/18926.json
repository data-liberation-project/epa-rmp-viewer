Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum stored would be 56,100 pounds in the facilities 12,000 gallon storage tank.  There are no rail facilities available here.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of one storage tank released as a gas in a total of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,100 pounds, which represents the volume of one storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedure.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model is 1.8 miles.\n\nThe alternative-case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1 inch transfer hose, with 1,2000 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint for dispersion is .5 miles.\n\nThis facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities.   These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nThis facility is only in its second year of operation.
