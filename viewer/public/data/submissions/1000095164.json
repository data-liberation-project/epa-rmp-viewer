As such, safety during all phases of this process is of utmost importance to the ownership, senior management, supervisors, and employees. Continual monitoring is performed by management and staff on both, process and personnel, to assure a satisfactory level of safety is being achieved. Any condition found suspect is analyzed and corrected. Nakoma Products periodically trains employees as to the safe handling of chemicals and machinery. Departure from established safety practices by an employee is not tolerated.  As mentioned previously, Nakoma Products is involved in the business of manufacturing and distributing paint propellants  and related products. Our facility is located within the bounds of the city of Bridgeview, IL. Of particular concern to the EPA per section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act is the storage and usage of approximately eight thousand gallons of product used to propel paint from a sprayer. These gases are stored in liquid form by pressurization in a certified eight thousand gallon capacity vessel located on the back lot of the property. \r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario in regards to the pressurized vessels would be the total release and ignition of the pressurized gas. The resulting explosion would have an off-site impact of approximately 0.3 mile radius. This is based upon the RMP computer model provided by the EPA. Nakoma Products, with the counsel and recommendations of the local fire department has installed hardware and safety systems making the worst case scenario highly unlikely. The above ground vessels with LPG are certified and periodically inspected for integrity and leaks. Any signs of potential problems are immediately repaired. All pumps and associated switches used in transfer process are explosion proof. Emergency shut off switches are strategically located, allowing for quick shu"

Extensive training and care is used in the area of LPG transfer.\r\n\r\nNakoma Products has demonstrated compliance with Process Safety Management. Thorough analyses of the LPG vessels, process, technology and equipment have been conducted. Daily visual and audible inspections are performed on the vessels and piping to detect any possible leaks. If any are found, they repaired immediately.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents or releases with respect to the LPG vessels in the previous ten years, as the plant is a new facility.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program at Nakoma Products begins at the ground level with our employees. A team of qualified personnel have trained in the area of detection and correction of an accidental release of LPG. A local emergency response company, Protect Environmental Service, Inc., is on contact to respond to any large release of LPG that may occur. Periodic inspections and education is provided by the local fire department.  Safety Data Sheets have been provided to the local fire department in the event of a release and the Local Emergency Planning Committee has been sent all required information including the Tier II.\r\n\r\nNakoma Products is constantly participating in any pertinent safety or instructional training offered by various organizations. In house inspections often lead to changes in methods or equipment used in the LPG process as well as other areas. The hazards of LPG and its transfer are certainly recognized by Nakoma Products. As a result, it is treated with respect. We are proud of our safety record and intend to continue the high level of vigilance required to maintain a safe operating environment for our employees and neighbors."
