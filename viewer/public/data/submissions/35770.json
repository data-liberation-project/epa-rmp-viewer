              "Description": "The St. Cloud Water Treatment Facility (WTF) falls under the EPA RMP 40 CFR 68 and OSHA PSM 29 CFR 1910.100 regulations for having an inventory on-site of chlorine gas over the threshold quanity of 2,500-lbs.  In lieu of this regulation, the St. Cloud WTF has developed a prevention program to eliminate injury and/or death to the St. Cloud WTF employees and the public in case of an accidental release.   Section 1: Introduction, Purpose and Management System - is to ensure that everyone who plays a part in the RMProgram understands their roles and responsibilities and those responsibilities are assigned for all program elements.  Responsibilities for each program element are assigned to specific St. Cloud WTF employees.  Section 2: Employee Participation Plan, is to define how employees will be involved in the RMProgram.  The St. Cloud WTF will provide an overview of the RMProgram, provide access to all RMProgram information required to safely perform their duties and will provide procedures on how to obtain this information.  Designated employees are listed under each program element.  Section3: Process Safety Information, is to provide process safely information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine gas, the technology of the process and the equipment used in the process.  This is accomplished through annual right-to-know training.  Section 4: Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), describes how the St. Cloud WTF will handle PHA to identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with chorine gas hazards.  The overall  purpose of a PHA is to prevent or minimize the effects of an accidental chorine release.  Section 5: Operation Procedures, is to ensure that the St. Cloud WTF maintains up to date and accurate written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) that provide clear instruction for all covered processes.  SOP's for changing a cylinder, response to a leak while changing a cylinder, loading and unloading a cylinder are some of the procedures written in this Section.  Section 6: Training, is to ensure that personnel working on or near chlorine are adequately trained and understand the inherent process hazards and appropriate response and action to accidental chlorine release.  Section 7: Contractor Responsibility, is to ensure that only contractors with good health and safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the chlorine system.  Employer and contractor responsibilites are assigned.  Section 8: Pre-startup Safety Review, is to ensure safe operation of new and modified regulated processes.  For new capial construction projects, the Project Engineer will conduct the pre-startup safety review, for modifications to the existing system, the Water Services Manager is assigned to conduct the pre-startup safety review.  Section 9: Mechanical Integrity, is to establish, implement and maintain an ongoing mechanical integrity that ensures process equipment and instrumention to mimimize the risk of an accidental chlorine gas release.  The Water Services Manager will determine which equipment in the chlorine process is covered, establish written maintainence procedures, train maintenance personnel, perform inspections and test on process equipment and correct equipment deficiencies.  Section 10: Hot Work Permit, is to ensure that a hot work permit is issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the chlorination system.  The Water Services Manager and all maintenance personnel are responsible for implementing this hot work permit procedure.  Section 11: Managing Change, is to make sure any system changes are properly reviewed against the original system specifications and be accomplished safely.  Section 12: Incident Investigation, is to document and investigate all incidents including \"near misses\" involving the release of chlorine gas to determine cause(s) and in order to prevent reoccurence.  The Water Services Manager and the Water Quality Coordinator is responsible to initiate and follow-through the incident investigation.  Section 13: Emergency Response Plan, is to establish a procedure for the timely mititgation of hazardous material incidents within the property of the St. Cloud WTF.

The EPA rule is applicable to the St. Cloud WTF because the maximum inventory for chlorine gas is greater than the 2,500-lbs. EPA RMP threshold.  The maximum amount of chlorine gas stored on-site is 18,000-lbs.  \n\n\n\nA requirement of the RMP is a Hazard Assessment of the potential impacts of a worst-case and alternate release scenarios.  An assessment of these scenarios is included with the submittal.  There have been no reportable accidents at the St. Cloud WTF in the last five years.\n\n\n\nActive administrative and mitigation control measures are utilized to prevent accidental release.  Chlorine gas detectors are in place and checked weekly.  An audible alarm will sound if chlorine gas is detected.  An accidental release of chlorine gas would take place in an enclosed building, slowing the release rate and decreasing the distance of travel.  A chlorine scrubber at the St. Cloud WTF is an active mitigation tool that will neutralize a chlorine gas leak.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to reduce the risk of an accidental release of chlorine gas and prevent injury to the public and WTF employees.  This is accomplished by specifying responsibilities and outlining safety procedures that will prevent and/or contain a chlorine gas release.\n\n\n\nThe City of St. Cloud Water Utility has an Emergency Action Plan to comply with Federal Regulations 40 CFR 1910.38(a).\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Risk Management Plan, the St. Cloud WTF has a written procedure to respond to hazardous "

      "SummaryText": "materials spills including chlorine gas.  The St. Cloud WTF uses a zone system to control and identify the areas of a hazardous material spill.  The zone system assists the Fire and Police Departments with areas of evacuation and hazardous materials containment.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is to ensure the safety and well being of the users of the water system and St. Cloud Public Utilities employees during times of emergency operations.  The plan identifies necessary administrative and employee actions during emergencies.  It does not cover all possible crisis or emergencies that may occur, but the actions indicated in the plan will assist in any type of emergency. \n\n\n\nElements addressed in the EAP include escape procedures and exit routes, critical plant operations, accounting for employees, rescue and medical duties, reporting emergencies, alarm systems and notification of emergencies and types of evacuations.\n\n\n\nThe Public Utilities Administration is committed to safety by providing annual right to know training, bloodborne pathogen training, lock out - tag out and confined space entry procedures.  Administration supports regular Hazard Control Meetings and Monthly City Safety Committee Meetings and provides personal protection equipment to all employees.  The City of St. Cloud will continue to make safety a high priority and is committed to employee training and improving the current safety policies and programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
