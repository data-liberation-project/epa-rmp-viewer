This facility complies with the Wisconsin Comm 43 for ammonia storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to contact the BEAVER DAM Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n                                                                                                                                                                                         A DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.  The facility is a farm cooperative.  The primary activity at this fertilizer facility is the storage, handling and mixing of fertilizers for distribution to local farmers. The 18,000 gallon storage tank that was reported in the initial RMP was dismantled and removed during the spring of 2004.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored,  and used for manufacturing of 10-34-0 and starter grades liquid fertilizer.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia is 130,000 pounds stored in one 30,000 gallon rail car.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity.\n                                                                                                                                                                                     Liquid fertilizer  is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid, and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexable hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high pressure rail cars.\n                                                                                                                                                                                   Liquid anhydrous ammonia is  pumped from the storage tank, thro"

The ammonium phosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium phosphate solution (i.e., 10-34-0). \n                                                                                                                                                                                   Situated above the holding pool is a cooling tower woith a fan that pulls air up the tower off of the holding pool.
