If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Walcott Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Scott County, Iowa LEPC will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned.

      "SummaryText": "D AT RIVER VALLEY COOPERATIVE, WALCOTT, IOWA:\n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\n\n\nThe system consists of one (1) storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is two (2).\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program, the distance to the endpoint is 5.6 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles.                                         \n\n\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves and emergency shut-off valves. The facility also has a nitrogen shut off system installed. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplersdesigned to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are to be locked when not in use.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively clos"

An evacuation plan is in place.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-most current copy with amendments and State law. \n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, River Valley Cooperative has extended to the Walcott Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nRiver Valley Cooperative, Walcott, Iowa has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of River Valley Cooperative to immediately notify the Walcott Volunteer Fire Department and the Scott County, Iowa LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Walcott Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Walcott location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Walcott has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Scott County LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In"

Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  The routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire.  Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.  In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.\n\n"
