BOX 310  SHELBY, NE  68662\nMailing Address\n\nRisk Management Plan- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of an accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, ?establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators,? however we are also engaged in providing ?agricultural inputs? that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading Anhydrous Ammonia is #493130 ?farm product warehousing and storage.?  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle Propane for both agricultural uses and home heating, which is under consideration as a listed substance.  We include Propane (as well as all crop protectants and petroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The maximum Quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage ves"

      "SummaryText": "sels at the location described is 352,000 Lbs.  The maximum on site vessel size is 30,000 Gallons, storing 127,500 Lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer tank (ranging from 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.)\n\nThe facility is operated on an ?as needed? basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080-hour requirement to qualify as a ?full-time employee? on site, therefore item number 1.11 is zero.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe ?worst-case release scenario? is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 127,500 Lbs. based on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4  miles based on EPA?s RMP-Comp Program (Version 1.06).  Possible public and environmental receptors within the area has been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) for their consideration.\n\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual, self closing excess flow, and ?pull away? valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is (Urban)0.06 miles (317 feet)rounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc.
