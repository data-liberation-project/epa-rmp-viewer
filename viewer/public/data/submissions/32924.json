The facility is located approximately 1 mile North of the intersection of El Camino Real and Palomar Airport Road.  The area surrounding the facility consists of the Maerkle reservoir, agricultural land, and a new residential development to the south.  Two very similar chlorine water treatment systems reside on the property: Lower Maerkle and Upper Maerkle.  The chlorine systems were constructed in 1995 accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  Each process is located within a separate chain link fenced area with access through one gate only.\n\nThe chlorine systems at Carlsbad MWD are used for the treatment of potable water used for distribution to the City of Carlsbad.  Chlorine is stored as a liquefied compressed gas in typical one-ton containers at the Carlsbad MWD Stations.  A maximum of three (3) one-ton chlorine containers can be stored in each of the Upper and Lower Maerkle chlorine tank rooms at any one time.  150-pound chlorine cylinders are no longer stored at the Lower or Upper Maerkle Stations.\n\nThe Maerkle Facility is a 111 acre site that consists of a ten million gallon distribution reservoir, a 600 acre foot long-term storage impound, one pumping/disinfection facility (Lower Maerkle), one impound disinfection facility (Upper Maerkle), related pressure control stations, meter stations, and a caretaker's residence. \n\nLower Maerkle Chlorine System\n\nChlorine gas is drawn from one of the two on-line one-ton containers through an automatic switch over/vacuum regulator.  Automatic switch over regulator valves control which container is actively feeding chlorine to the vacuum regulator.  The other co"

The chlorine can be distributed to four independently-controlled processes: System 20, System 25, System 30, and System 40.  Each process feeds chlorine gas into solution at an injector where it is mixed with water.  System 20 is flow paced only ? the chlorine feed rate is manually controlled at the rotameter.  The other three systems are compound loop systems ? the chlorine feed rate is controlled by a combination of manual adjustment at the rotameter and residual chlorine concentration.\n\nThe one-ton containers are stored in the chlorine tank room, which is protected by a scrubber with a capacity of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The scrubber is activated based on the alarm status of two chlorine detectors located in the tank room and one detector in the chlorinator room.  A detection of 1 part per million (ppm) activates on-site alarms and alerts operators via a telemetry system.  A detection of 3 ppm initiates operation of the chlorine scrubber. \n\nA scale that indicates the remaining weight of chlorine in each of the on-line one-ton containers allows system operators to plan ahead for placing chemical supply orders for delivery.  A monorail hoist is used to change out the chlorine cylinders.\n\nThe chlorine system is operated entirely under vacuum conditions.  Carlsbad MWD has removed all pressurized piping by attaching a vacuum regulator to each of the one-ton container valves.  The containers are positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  The flex tubing is connected to the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas (not liquid) is drawn out of the container.  A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line downstream of the vacuum regulator, a diap"

Any chlorine in the piping upon loss of vacuum (downstream of the vacuum leak) will be drawn to the injection point and into solution.\n\nUpper Maerkle Chlorine System\n\nThe design and operation of the chlorine system (upstream of the chlorinators) at the Upper Maerkle facility is essentially identical to that of the lower station.  Only two chlorinators are used at the Upper facility.  Prior to injection, the chlorine gas passes through a chlorine dioxide generator that used sodium hypochlorite as a reagent to create chlorine dioxide.  The process feeds this chlorine dioxide into solution at the injector where it is mixed with water.  Similar chlorine detection and scrubber systems are located at the Upper facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe CMWD chlorine systems have many safety features.  Much of the systems' safety is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern their operation.  For example, the CMWD treatment processes operate in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are three mechanisms in the facility to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine gas detectors, 2) visual/audible alarms, and 3) emergency chlorine scrubber system.  In case of chlorine detection (1 ppm), the chlorine gas detectors, which are strategically located in the chlorine buildings (tank and chlorinator rooms), trigger audible and visual alarms on-site and the duty (on-call) operator is paged through the telemetry system.  Should the chlorine concentration reach 3 ppm, the detectors will activate the chlorine scrubber system, which protects each chlorine building and shuts off the ventilation system that continuou"

The scrubber has the capability of neutralizing 2,000 pounds of chlorine with a 99%+ rate of effectiveness.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, vacuum regulators prevent chlorine from escaping the systems.  A backup generator, which is activated during a power outage, is maintained on site to power the chlorine systems and scrubbers.  If vacuum conditions are compromised, the vacuum regulators close stopping chlorine flow from the one-ton containers.  Chlorine vent lines are piped to ventilation intakes of the scrubber system.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Carlsbad MWD facility accident history during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (May 13th, 2004), revealed that there have been no reportable chlorine releases or chlorine related incidents over the past five years (May 1999 through May 2004).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCarlsbad MWD has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.

The duty operator alerts the Public Works Supervisor and immediately responds to the alarm.  Upon arrival, the Supervisor will determine whether or not the Fire Department is to be called to respond to the emergency based on the severity of the incident.  The duty operator assignment is made on a rotating basis between the 5 chlorine systems operators.  Each chlorine operator has the necessary hazardous materials training to be considered \"qualified\" to respond to a chlorine leak.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation provided mitigation measures to improve safety at Carlsbad Municipal Water District Facility located at 5203 Sunny Creek Road in Carlsbad, California.  The Revalidation was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the chlorine systems since the initial HAZOP Study, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the initial PHA, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, and the review of chlorine checklists.  The changes are scheduled to be completed by June 2005.\n\nIn addition the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for Carlsbad MWD employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility's safety programs.\n\n2.
