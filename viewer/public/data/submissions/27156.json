      "SummaryText": "Milliken Chemical, a Division of Milliken and Company owns and operates the Dewey Plant.  The Dewey Plant is a specialty chemical batch operation located in Inman, which is approximately 7 miles north of Spartanburg in South Carolina.\n\nThe first priority of the Dewey Plant is the health and safety of its associates and the surrounding community.  OSHA recognized the Dewey Plant as a Star site in 1994 and has re-certified this classification twice since then, in 1997 and 2000.  Of equal importance is protection of the environment.  To this end significant resources are committed to ensuring complete compliance with all regulations and that the plant is operated in a manner that protects the quality of our environment.  \n\nThe U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulates Ethylene oxide when it is stored in quantities in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The Dewey Plant is subject to the regulation due to the fact that Ethylene oxide is stored on site in excess of this threshold quantity.  Ethylene oxide is received by rail car and is stored in a storage tank.  Ethylene oxide is a building block chemical used to manufacture a wide variety of industrial chemicals including, lubricants, surfactants, industrial intermediates used in coatings, colorant manufacture and a variety of other applications.  \n\nIn addition the Dewey Plant stores Propylene oxide and Phosphorous oxychloride in excess of the regulatory thresholds, 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds respectively.   Propylene oxide is received by rail car and is stored in a storage tank and phosphorous oxychloride is received and stored in drums.\n\nPropylene oxide is also a building block chemical used in the manufacture of products similar to those of Ethylene Oxide.  Phosphorous oxychloride is also a building block chemical, which is used in the manufacture of flame-retardants, pharmaceutical ingredients, agricultural products and colorants, which are used in urethane foams.\n\nThe Dewey Plant is a program 3 facility due to the "

      "SummaryText": "fact that the worst-case scenario modeling for Ethylene Oxide predicts the potential for off site consequences.  Program 3 requires both a worst case and alternative case modeling analysis to be performed.  In addition an alternative case scenario must be performed for Propylene Oxide and Phosphorous oxychloride.\n\nThe U.S. EPA explicitly specifies the conditions for the worst-case scenario release.  According to the General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (EPA 550-B-98-003) page 4-4, the chances of a worst-case release occurring are very low.  The assumptions required for the worst case release are very conservative, including complete failure of all safety systems and worst case weather conditions for air dispersion: consequently the results are very conservative. \n\nThe endpoints, which are specified for each toxic substance, are intended to protect the general public.  These endpoints are concentrations below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without serious health effects.  The distance to the end point estimated under the worst case scenario should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger, but rather it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.  The EPA intended these distances to form the basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders and the general public rather than the basis for any specific actions.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Dewey Plant is a release of the contents from a storage tank of Ethylene oxide.  The entire contents of the storage tank would be released in ten minutes.  There are schools, residences, recreational and commercial areas within this radius.  As noted earlier in the quote from the U.S. EPA, the worst-case scenario represents the ?maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic condit"

The Dewey Plant has controls in place, which will detect releases, and under certain conditions sprinkler systems will be activated to minimize release impact.  For the purposes of this analysis, 5-minute release duration is assumed.  This release is isolated to the plant site and there are no off site consequences.\n\n The alternative case scenario for Propylene oxide is similar to the Ethylene Oxide scenario in which there is a leak in a transfer hose.  As mentioned in the Ethylene oxide scenario there are controls in place, which will detect releases, and under certain conditions sprinkler systems will be activated to minimize release impact.  For the purposes of this analysis, 5-minute release duration is assumed.  This release is isolated to the plant site and there are no off site consequences.\n\nThe alternate case scenario for phosphorous oxychloride involves a drum falling from a pallet during transportation on the plant site and developing a leak.  The entire contents of the drum would leak on the ground and vaporize.   This release is isolated to the plant site and there are no off site consequences.\n\nThe Dewey Plant is committed to the education and training of all associates in the area of safety and emergency response.  For this reason plant associates are ready to respond in the event of an emergency.  Plant associates are trained to respond to both fire and hazardous material emergencies.  In addition the plant has worked closely with the North Spartanburg Fire Department to ensure that they are prepared to respond in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe Dewey Plant is committed to minimizing the potential for safety incidents, which would affect the plant associates and / or neighbors.  To this end monitoring systems have been installed for early detection of leaks in order that preventive action may be taken.  In addition leak detection is conducted quarterly in specific "
