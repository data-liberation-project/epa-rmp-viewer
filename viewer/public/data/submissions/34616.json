This includes information pertaining to: \n\nHazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\nThe technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\nEquipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nMOTIVA has performed initial process hazard analysis (PHA) with review and participation from Huntsman to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards. MOTIVA Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process. The A&O Plant is invited by MOTIVA to participate in PHAs.  MOTIVA revalidated the initial PHA 03/27/2003.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, MOTIVA does have a Hurricane Procedure and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane and inclement weather.\n \nOperating Procedures\nMOTIVA maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide cle"

The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \nTraining\nMOTIVA provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.  \n \nMechanical Integrity\nHuntsman has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \nManagement of Change\nHuntsman has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any  modification to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.\n \nPre-Startup Review\nMOTIVA, with review and participation of Huntsman, performs pre-startup safety reviews when the addition of or a modification to t"
