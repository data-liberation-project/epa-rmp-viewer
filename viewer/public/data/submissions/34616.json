Huntsman Port Neches Tank Farm is committed to achieving excellence in environmental, health and safety.  The Huntsman Port Neches Tank Farm implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the facility and assures a well-trained work force.   The program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Port Neches Tank Farm participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), Port Neches Fire Department and the Sabine Neches Chiefs Association to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies. The Plant Manager of the A&O Plant is responsible for implementation of the risk management program (RMP) for the Huntsman Port Neches Tank Farm.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances. The Port Neches Tank Farm consists of two (2)  storage tanks owned by Huntsman, but operated by and on property leased from MOTIVA ENTERPRISES LLC (MOTIVA) and is located in Port Neches, Texas.   The site stores naphtha unloaded from barges or ships and is used as feedstock for Huntsman's A&O Plant in Port Arthur.\n\nThe ten (10) flammable regulated substances are:\n\nPropane - Raw material recycled to manufacture propylene and ethylene and is an ingredient in natural gas.\n\n2-Methyl Propene, Butane, 1-Butene, 1,3-Butadiene, 2-Butene cis and trans - Products used as raw materials in the manufacture of synthetic rubber for tires, and butyl rubber for films, coatings and carpet.\n\nIsopentane, Pentane ? Raw and recycled materials used as feed stocks for the manufacture of ethylene and propylene or sold as product mix.\n\n2,2-Dimethylpropane\n \n3.

This includes information pertaining to: \n\nHazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\nThe technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\nEquipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nMOTIVA has performed initial process hazard analysis (PHA) with review and participation from Huntsman to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards. MOTIVA Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process. The A&O Plant is invited by MOTIVA to participate in PHAs.  MOTIVA revalidated the initial PHA 03/27/2003.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, MOTIVA does have a Hurricane Procedure and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane and inclement weather.\n \nOperating Procedures\nMOTIVA maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide cle"

The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \nTraining\nMOTIVA provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.  \n \nMechanical Integrity\nHuntsman has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \nManagement of Change\nHuntsman has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any  modification to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.

The pre-startup safety review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n \nCompliance Audit\nHuntsman/MOTIVA performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its Process Safety Management Program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.  \n \nIncident Investigation\nHuntsman and MOTIVA investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman and MOTIVA has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  Huntsman and MOTIVA has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to  document their resolution.

MOTIVA consults with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of PHA?s and on the development of other elements of the Process Safety Management Program.  MOTIVA ensures that all employees have access to PHA?s and all other process safety management information.\n \nHot Work Permit\nHuntsman and MOTIVA employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark producing operations).  If any hot work is performed near a covered process, Huntsman A&O issues a permit and MOTIVA issued another permit, that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.  Hot work permits are kept on site until the work is complete.\n\nContractors\nHuntsman and MOTIVA have developed procedures for selecting and ensuring that contractors are competent and knowledgeable and can safely perform their work.  Huntsman and MOTIVA provides information to contractors about the hazards that may be present in the work area and have developed appropriate safe work practices.  Huntsman and MOTIVA also evaluate the safety performance and programs of the contractors as a part of their continued employment.\n \n4.  5 Year Accident History. The facility has had no incidents in the last five years that resulted in an off site impact for the 5 year accident history.  \n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  Huntsman and MOTIVA have a written emergency response programs that contain procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a regulated substance.
