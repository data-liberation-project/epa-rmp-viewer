This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Salina Fire Department and the Saline County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance \nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity. Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for the Schwan's frozen pizza operations. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Schwan's is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSchwan's has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. To meet these necessary requirements Schwan's has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n4.\tFive-Year Accident History\nSchwan\u0092s will report any and all qualifying incidents to the EPA as well as record them in the submission of the risk management program. As this Facility is a newly constructed and commissione"

      "SummaryText": "d facility, there are no accidents to report on the five-year accident history. \n\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\nThis Schwan's facility has developed an Emergency Response Plan. It is a detailed document that discusses the role of employees in an emergency. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuation of plant personnel. Emergency response personnel on site, have completed required emergency training in accordance with 29 CFR1910.120. The emergency response team has approximately 25 members, all trained at the 24-hour technician level by a specialized 3rd party vendor or Salina Fire Department and Saline County Emergency Management Agency. Training emphasizes ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, protective equipment including use of level \"A\" suits and interaction with an incident command system (ICS). Emergency plans are filed with the local fire department and annual walk-throughs are conducted with fire officers. Pre-planned command posts and staging areas are designated, and IC transfer and liaison protocols have been established. Post incident de-briefings are conducted. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSchwan's continually reviews opportunities to improve system reliability and safety. This review is accomplished through periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. The facility Management of Change process also serves as a means of reviewing changes for facility and personnel safety. Schwan's personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration processes."
