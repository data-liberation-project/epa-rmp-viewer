The only RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system in this facility uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nThis facility follows a rigorous RMP & Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The program is also in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM & RMP programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan will be available to the local LEPC for review.\n\n\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\n\nThis is an ice plant. Ammonia (R-717) is used as the refrigerant to freeze water and to cool air which in turn keeps the ice storage area cold. The refrigeration compressors are in the engine room and operate at temperatures down to +10A?F. This refrigeration system is a liquid re-circulating system and is designed to operate with an overfeed-ratio of approximately 3:1 for of the evaporative air units. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems contain four interconnected sub-systems:\n\n\n\n1.High-temperature evaporator system.\n\n2.Thermosyphon oil cooling system.\n\n3.Condenser system.\n\n4.Compressor high-temperature system.\n\n\n\nThe re-circulator is a horizontal pressure vessel. The low-temperature liquid is pumped from this vessel to the air units where thirty- percent of the liquid mass is "

The low temperature compressors take the ammonia vapor from this vessel and compress it. This vessel has connection with the compressors (dry suction) and with the evaporators (wet suction and pumped liquid).\n\n\n\nThe high-pressure receiver is a vertical vessel. The high-pressure receiver stores the ammonia liquid coming from the condensers through the thermosyphon pilot-receiver. The top of this vessel is used as a thermosyphon pilot-receiver. This section is d and used for storing a minimum five-minute supply of liquid ammonia for oil cooling and for separating liquid out of the return flow of ammonia from the thermosyphon oil coolers. All liquid from the condenser flows through this vessel. The thermosyphon oil coolers on the screw compressors are fed from this vessel and return a liquid/gas mix back through the thermosyphon return piping. Most of the liquid ammonia from the condenser drains through this receiver to the high-pressure receiver.\n\nHigh-pressure liquid is fed from this vessel to the rest of the system. This vessel has connection with the re-circulator and the condensers.\n\n\n\nThe evaporative condensers use axial fans in a flow-through configuration. High-pressure ammonia-vapor flows from the compressors to the evaporative condenser where heat is removed. The vapor is condensed into a high-pressure liquid using air and water flowing over the outside of the condensing pipe coils. High-pressure liquid from the condenser is drained to the high-pressure receiver. The saturated condensing temperature is 90A?F. The condenser has connections with the compressor discharge piping, the high-pressure receiver, and the purger.\n\n\n\nThe evaporators are fed from liquid pumps. The feed rate is approximately 3:1. This system will circulate three times the amount of the refrigerant needed by the evaporator for the rated capacity. The +10A?F liquid ammonia is circula"

P&ID prints are available for review. Pipe, fittings, and connections specifications for ammonia refrigeration systems shall meet or exceed ASME/ANSI B31.5 specifications.\n\n\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The emergency ventilation discharges the engine room air through the roof, which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence. \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP. Following is an overview.\n\n\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for all employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the Process Safety Management Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program, including "

Community involvement is through coordination, cooperation, and pre-planning with the local Fire department and LEPC.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as SDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the \"What-if\" technique.  This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator. Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments. The SOPs cover different phases of o"

      "SummaryText": "perations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.\n\n\n\nTraining - All employees are who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems. This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.  These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the app"

The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan - This facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  This plan will be provided to the local fire department and the SouthCoast Regional  Emergency Planning Committee (REPC).\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits and RMP Revisions - To insure that all areas of PSM and RMP programs are followed, the company requires compliance audits.  At a minimum, these must be completed every three years. Resubmission of the RMP shall be done every five years to meet the OCA requirements.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY - LAST FIVE YEARS\n\nThere have been one RMP reportable accidents (4/3/18) within the past five years."
