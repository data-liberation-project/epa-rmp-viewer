      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nResin pellets and other additives are mixed at the blending stations and fed to screw-type extruders. The mixture is heated in the extruder to produce a homogeneous melt. The blowing agent, isobutene, is injected into the polymer via a high pressure metering system. A large revolving screw directs the melted resin toward a die to produce the desired shape of the final product. The product is then cooled using water or air, cut to size, printed with product specifications and further cooled before being packaged and stored in a warehouse. Isobutane is the only hazardous substance used in the process. \n\nThe extrusion lines are shutdown for product changeover, multiple times per week.  These periods of shutdown are followed by a startup cycle that lasts approximately one hour before high-quality, low-density foam is produced. Due to the delicate nature of low-density, closed cell polyethylene foam, several parameters (temperature, pressure, amou8nt of gas, and air flow from vents) must be adjusted gradually throughout the start up cycle. \n\nDuring the approximately the first 15 minutes of the startup cycle, high temperature and pressure are used to lower the viscosity of the plastic in the extruder lines. A low amount of blowing agent (isobutene) is injected into the melted polymer resulting in the formation of inferior cellular structures. These inferior structures are incapable of capturing and retaining any significant amount of isobutene. As a result, the gas is allowed to escape as the off-spec product exits the extruder. A vent is positioned near the point where the product exits the extruder to collect the escaping gas. Over the next 45 minutes, the temperature and pressure are gradually lowered and the amount of isobutene is increased. \n\nNomaco uses a variety of failsafe safeguards to prevent accidental releases. There are emergency shut off valves on both tanks, both tanks have excess flow valves, there are over / under pressure valves betwe"
