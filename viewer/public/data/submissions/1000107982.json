Ghent Station is required to comply with the most stringent EPA Risk Management Plan and OSHA Process Safety Management programs. \n\nFive-year accident history: Ghent Station has not had an accident in the past five years involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event an alarm or emergency condition occurs related to anhydrous ammonia, the Emergency Response Plan will be initiated and maintained until the emergency condition has stabilized.  \n\nWhen the emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system occurs, the automated \nDistributed Control System (DCS) or the operator will manually close the main valves, shutdown \nthe system and evacuate the immediately effected area. The anhydrous ammonia storage area \nalso has an emergency fogging system that is automatically initiated by process area ammonia leak detectors or manually activated by push buttons. Ghent Station employees are trained to use self-contained breathing equipment and have taken OSHA Hazard Communication training as well as anhydrous ammonia general awareness training.  \n\nThere is an Emergency Response Team (ERT) at Ghent Station comprised of dayshift and shift workers. The ERT handles medical emergencies, hazardous material (HAZMAT) response, and confined space rescue. The various training levels of members include Kentucky-certified Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), Hazardous Materials Technicians (as defined by 29 CFR 1910.120), and Confined Space Rescue Technicians.

The owners, management, and employees of Ghent Station are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the system. If an emergency were to occur, it is Ghent Station's policy to notify the Carroll County LEPC and respond to the emergency. The facility has a site-specific Emergency Response Plan that addresses response to incidents and emergencies.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: Ghent Station is a coal-fired electric power generation station consisting of four individual units. Units 1, 3, and 4 employ selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology, which uses anhydrous ammonia, to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions at the stack. Anhydrous ammonia, delivered by truck and stored in two 90,000-gallon storage tanks, is the only RMP-regulated substance at this facility above the threshold quantity levels established by EPA. \nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a colorless gas at ambient temperature or pressure; it is, however, stored as a liquid under pressure. The gas is less dense than air, but when liquid anhydrous ammonia is released it may aerosolize and behave as a dense gas.  The effects of anhydrous ammonia inhalation range from irritation to severe respiratory injuries to death. Anhydrous ammonia is self-alarming; its strong odor is noticeable at concentrations above 5 ppm; the concentration that is immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 300 ppm.  In general, people will not remain in the presence of anhydrous ammonia so the primary threat is to people who are unable to evac"
