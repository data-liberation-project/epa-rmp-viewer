This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as the training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable spills or releases of substances.   If, in spite of all precautions, should a release or spill occur, BASF-Zachary's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. In addition to trained personnel, berms and containment walls are utilized throughout the facility. \n\n  <    Chemical burns caused by corrosives and solvents. These types of injuries occur when personnel come into direct contact with the material.  Prevention of skin and eye contact with any material will prevent these types of injuries.  Training and use of the proper personal protective equipment is emphad to prevent skin and eye contact.  A safety shower and eye-wash stations are provided in all work areas for the safety of workers in the event skin or eye contact should occur. A current eyewash inspection program is in place to ensure the integrity of each eyewash station.\n\n  <    Burns resulting from fires or explosion would be similar to any high temperature burns.  Smoke inhalation is also a possibility in a fire. Fire monitors and sprinkler systems are located throughout the plant. A significant number of employees are members of a Fire Brigade and are trained to fight incipient fires. 100% of BASF-Zachary's employees have had annual hands-on Fire Extinguisher training. New employees will receive this type of training"

      "SummaryText": " when the annual training is scheduled.\n\n  <    Storage and handling of flammable liquids pose the greatest potential for causing an emergency.   Every effort is made to ensure that all chemicals are handled in the safest methods possible to minimize the possibilities of fire or explosion.  Smoking is prohibited in the hazardous material storage areas and access is restricted to authorized personnel.   Other combustible materials are stored at a safe distance from flammable liquids.   Drums are kept securely closed unless it becomes necessary to sample or transfer the chemical.   Potential sources of ignition are avoided when chemicals are being handled.   Flammable liquids are only handled where ventilation is adequate to avoid a concentration of explosive vapors. Hot Work procedures are in place and permits must be issued before Hot Work must be conducted.\n\nThe BASF - Zachary site is also manned by a 24/7 Guard Service to prevent any incidents involving unauthorized persons who may accidently or intentionally cause damage to our site, our neighbors, or the environment. BASF - Zachary also abides by all DHS Security regulations and has a DOT Security Plan in place.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nBASF-Zachary manufactures, processes, and stores specialty chemicals in Zachary, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, and evaluated the facility to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded threshold quantities.  Based on process knowledge, BASF-Zachary identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The facility uses six regulated substances in four separate processes.  The chemicals and largest quantity (numbers are rounded) on site either as largest quantity in a single process or total quantity of mixtures are: methyl chloride (230,000 lbs); formaldehyde (127,000 lbs); phosphorus trichloride (102,000 lbs); flammable mixture with acetaldehyde (77,000 lbs); ethyl chloride (66,000 lbs); and 2-methylp"

Therefore, the four BASF-Zachary processes are classified as Program 3 processes under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances:      The endpoint for the worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 pound per square inch (psi) over pressure (i.e., 15.7 psia) for vapor cloud explosions.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.    BASF-Zachary has 2 worst case scenarios for flammables because the scenarios go off-site and affect different off-site receptors.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi over pressure for the worst-case release of 2-methylpropene using RMP Comp is 0.3 miles and for the flammable mixture (with acetaldehyde) using RMP Comp is also 0.3 miles.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances:      Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  Each of the three regulated toxic substances at BASF-Zachary was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to endpoint.  The RMP Comp results indicate that a worst-case release of methyl chloride results in a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately 3.7 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence line.  Conditions considered for alternative release scenarios are: a release rate dependent upon scenario; use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source; the actual release height; and consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances:     A single alternative release"

      "SummaryText": " scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP Program.  BASF-Zachary considered several alternative release scenarios.  Using RMP Comp, it was determined that a hypothetical release of 2-Methyl Propene would result in the greatest off-site impact, having a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances:    One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  Release scenarios have been evaluated for the regulated toxic substances at BASF-Zachary.  Based on the RMP Comp results, the substances and the distances selected for the toxic endpoints are: formaldehyde (0.1 miles); methyl chloride (0.4 miles); phosphorus trichloride (0.7 miles).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release and Chemical Specific Prevention Program\n\n\n\nAt BASF-Zachary, processes regulated by the EPA's risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard, and a brief summary of each OSHA PSM/EPA RMP element is provided.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:    BASF-Zachary encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams.  In addition, BASF-Zachary has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nThe BASF-Zachary has also implemented a Behavior Based Safety Program. This program enabled employees to observe work being performed and determine if any unsafe behaviors occur. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:    BASF-Zachary keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  \n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):    BASF-Zachary has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nBASF-Zachary primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.
