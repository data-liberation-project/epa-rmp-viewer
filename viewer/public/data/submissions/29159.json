The plant manufactures fresh pork and processed meats that provide consumers with high-quality meat products. This facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan submission to include hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\n\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Farmland Foods, Inc., Crete, Nebraska.\n\n\n\nFacility Snapshot\n\nThis facility, was mostly constructed in 1974 with additions through the years. The plant produces over 600 million pounds of product annually.\n\n\n\nImpact on the community\n\n* Farmland employs 1,200 area residents at a combined annual salary of approximately $41 million.\n\n* The facility paid over $200 million for utilities, materials and live hogs from the local area.\n\n\n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nFarmland employees are involved in community activities.  The facility supports local non-profit and other community support organizations. \n\n\n\n Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hazardous and regulated substances and to minimize the effects of any such releases that may occur.  Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of this plant, to the safety of its employees, and to the safety of the gener"

The response plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the plant has interacted with possible responding agencies for many years regarding the plan and activities at the plant.  Employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and in possible response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.  The plant has a Hazmat Team made up of plant employees who are trained to respond in the event of an ammonia or chlorine release on site.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAmmonia refrigeration and wastewater chlorination storage and handling constitute the processes at this facility that are covered by the EPA Risk Management Plan rule.\n\n\n\nThe facility has  175,000 pounds of ammonia on site which is used as a refrigerant in its ammonia refrigeration system.  This is a closed, contained system, in which the ammonia is recirculated to refrigerate the meat processing and storage areas in the plant. \n\n\n\nThe facility uses chlorine for wastewater disinfection and has a maximum inventory of  8,000 pounds of chlorine on site.\n\n \n\nSynopsis of Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst-case and alternate  release scenarios for regulated substances "

For this facility, two regulated toxic substances are included, anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.  \n\n\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst-case event, unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.   It should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst-case scenario is extremely low. \n\n \n\nAlternate scenarios, for each regulated toxic, which are more likely events, must also be presented.  More likely release events tend to concentrate in areas such as failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses. Significantly lower quantities are involved and operator intervention would tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of such failures.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release - Ammonia\n\nThe largest vessel, located outdoors, has a maximum capacity of  42,248 pounds.  The worst case scenario assumes that this entire amount would release in 10 minutes, as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  The worst-case scenario would reach offsite endpoints, including public and environmental receptors.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Toxics - Ammonia\n\nThis alternate release scenario consists of a pipe leak, which discharges 200 pounds of ammonia in 20 minutes prior to the operator stopping the leak. This scenario would reach an offsite endpoint and would effect public receptors.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Toxics - Chlorine\n\nThis alternate release scenario consists of 10 pounds of chlorine, which releases through a piping leak, in 20 minutes.  The release rate is mitigated by the concrete building.  This scenario would reach an offsite endpoints and would effect public receptors.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration and wastewater chlo"

Periodically, the plan is practiced in a table top, classroom type setting, and also  drilled in mock emergencies.\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. The Crete plant has an excellent five-year accident record with no qualifying accidental releases.\n\n \n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the plant, facilitated by the EPA Prevention Program/OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously, as needs are identified through these procedures and policies.\n\n"
