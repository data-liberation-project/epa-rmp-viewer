Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nBecause our firm has a strong regard for environmental protection, product stewardship and safety concerns, we operate in a manner to be both responsible and responsive in all our efforts to protect the physical environment, our employees, customers and the general public.  We comply with environmental stewardship, safety laws and regulations.  \n\n\n\nWhere our company becomes aware of environmental and product safety risks not covered by existing laws or regulations, we develop our own good faith standards and practices based on comprehensive and relevant scientific data.  We cooperate with the public, government, industry and employees in identifying environmental, product stewardship and safety goals and in developing effective control programs.  Each operating unit of the company is expected to be guided by this policy in forming plans, setting objectives, and conducting their day-to-day activities.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response procedures include notification of the local fire department.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The facility is fenced to help keep it secure.\n\n\n\nWe have a strong EHS staff that takes an active role in area safety and environmental leadership.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce specialty ingredients, nutritional additives, and environmental products for animal agriculture and human foods.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck (transports) and is stored in a single tank located in the central portion of the property.  The capacit"

      "SummaryText": "y of the storage tank is 15,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  The tank is designed to store 85% of its capacity; therefore, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at our plant is approximately 12,750 gallons, or approximately 75,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\n \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations including OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for our employees as well as our neighbors and environment.  We continue to evaluate and improve our processes for all our equipment and materials.  Delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained regarding anhydrous ammonia hazards and emergency response through their company and on-site emergency action plans.  We take the extra diligence to conduct supplier audits to ensure those sending materials to us have followed proper procedures in product quality and safety. \n\n\n\nOur employees watch the delivery of each truck bringing anhydrous ammonia to our site. We lease our anhydrous ammonia storage vessel from an anhydrous ammonia vendor and require them to periodically inspect components they own of the anhydrous ammonia system, and make any necessary adjustments to either equipment or procedures to continue to ensure safe handling and use of anhydrous ammonia.  Our maintenance staff has an electronic system to remind us of required inspections and replacements.  We follow this up with self-audits, ISO quality audits and food safety compliance reviews.  \n\n \n\n4. Five-year accident history:\n\n \n\nOver the last five years we have had no reportable releases.  All of our accidents in the ammonia areas, as well as all other areas of the company are immediately investigated and followed through to ensure closure of corrective action items.\n\n \n\n5. Th"

      "SummaryText": "e emergency response program:\n\n \n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the management system we have in place and the appropriate discovery and notification procedures to ensure coordination with our local emergency responders.  We have discussed this program with the Des Moines Fire Department.  We welcome all fire shifts and spill response teams to conduct on-site walkthroughs, especially when there have been station realignments or staffing changes to fire department personnel.  We consider our relationship with the fire department to be a partnership with regular interaction with the fire marshal and the inspector's office.  \n\n\n\n6. Changes done to improve safety:\n\n\n\nIn February 2018 a near miss where a solenoid valve failure that could have resulted in an ammonia release started the reevaluation of the whole system using the HAZOP evaluation.  All of the changes that were identified in the HAZOP were ran the through the management of change process and were implemented by April 2018.  As all of the systems were updated all SOP's for the system were updated and all affected employees were trained on the changes.  The changes include: adding a proportioning valve on ammonia tank for more precise ammonia flow, fail safe isolation valve on ammonia tank, PSV's were all changed and relocated for to ensure redundancy.  Redundant pressure monitoring with two digital and two manual monitors.  An additional E-stop was added to the supervisor's office.  All gaskets in system were replaced and the old relay control system was replaced by a PLC.\n\n\n\nKemin will continue to evaluate the system and make changes to improve employee, product and public safety.\n\n\n\n"
