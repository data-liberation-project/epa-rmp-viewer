Risk Management Plan\n                                         Executive Summary\n\nThe Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 added Section 112(r) to the CAA, which mandated the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a regulatory program to prevent serious chemical accidents that may potentially affect public health and the environment.  The CAA makes it clear that facilities that handle hazardous substances bear the primary responsibility for ensuring their safe use.  This statutory mandate required EPA to establish a list of regulated substances as well as propose elements of an accidental release prevention program.\n\nUnder the requirements of Section 112(r), stationary sources (facilities) must identify and assess their chemical hazards and implement certain activities that are designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases. Also, facilities must submit a risk management plan (RMP) that summarizes these activities, and the plans will be available to state and local governments, the public and other stakeholders. The hazard assessment data disclosed by facilities can be used by local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) and other local response agencies to improve community emergency response planning. Also, the information in the risk management plan gives citizens the opportunity to work with industry to reduce risks to the community from chemical accidents.\n\nThe final RMP rule spells out requirements for the following basic components of a risk management program that regulated facilities must implement:\n\n     A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and offsite impacts of worst-case and alternative accidental release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five-year accident histories involving regulated substances;\n\n     A prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, training, ma"

Anhydrous ammonia (the threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds; the site has 313,000 pounds) and chlorine (the threshold quantity is 2,500 pounds; the site has 16,000 pounds) and are the only RMP regulated substances, at this facility, above the threshold quantity levels established by EPA\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, stored in two 35,550  gallon storage tanks, is contained in the SCR system, which is delivered to the stack to reduce nitrous oxides emissions. Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a colorless gas at ambient temperature or pressure; it is, however, stored as a liquid under pressure.  The gas is less dense than air, but when liquid ammonia is released it may aerosolize and behave as a dense gas.  The effects of ammonia inhalation range from irritation to severe respiratory injuries to death.  Ammonia is self-alarming; its strong odor is noticeable at concentrations above 50 ppm; concentration that is immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 300 ppm.  In general, people will not remain in the presence of ammonia so that the primary threat is to people who are unable to flee.\n\nThis facility uses chlorine to treat river water for plant usage (e.g. cooling water) in quantities requiring an RMP (under present EPA regulation).  This process is similar to the chlorination process used in drinking water supplies.  Chlorine is a dense, nonflammable greenish-yellow gas with a bleach-like odor.  It is corrosive and severely irritating to all tissue.  The chlorine reduces bacterial and algal growth. The water treatment systems consist of a one ton chlorine container and "

If an emergency were to occur, it is WKEC?s policy to notify the Webster County LEPC and respond to the emergency.  A site specific emergency plan has been developed to address emergencies.\n\nThe worst case scenario, Anhydrous Ammonia:  As required by EPA, the worst case scenario evaluates the failure of one of the 35,550  gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60?F), resulting in a dense vapor cloud.  According to EPA's RMP* Comp (an EPA approved modeling program), the distance with EPA established concentrations of concern is approximately 6.9 miles.  The 6.9 mile radius includes an estimated residential population of 5,844 people, a recreational area, a school, and office or industrial areas.\n\nThe worst case scenario, Chlorine:  As required by EPA, the worst case scenario evaluates the failure of the one ton chlorine container when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60?F), resulting in a dense vapor cloud.  According to EPA's RMP* Comp (an EPA approved modeling program), the distance with EPA established concentrations of concern is approximately three miles.  The three mile radius includes an estimated residential population of 1,438 people, a recreational area, and office or industrial areas.\n\nFive-year accident history:  The Reid/Henderson/Green Stations have not had an accident in the past five years involving chlorine that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.

The Reid/Henderson/Green Stations are required to comply with the most stringent EPA RMP and OSHA prevention programs.\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving the chlorine or anhydrous ammonia systems, it is WKEC?s policy for the operator to evacuate the immediate area.  If any release is likely to impact off site, the local emergency services will be notified. WKEC has an in-house rescue team (ERT) whose members are trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician level as defined by 29 CFR 1910.120. The ERT members are trained to use self-contained breathing equipment and Level A suits and have taken OSHA worker right-to-know training.
