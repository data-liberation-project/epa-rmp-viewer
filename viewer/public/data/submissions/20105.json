              "Description": "Prarielnad Prcoessors, Inc. is a Meat Processing facility (from carcass) which utilizes anhydrous ammonia for cold storage of product received, stored, and shipped.  The NAICS Code for this facility is 311612 (Meat Processed From Carcass).  Our safety information was last reviewed on January 12, 200 (safety meetings are conducted as well).We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Associations, American Society of Mechanical Engineers,  and the US Department of Agriculture.  These standards and all applicable OSHA requirements have been implemented at Prairieland Processors through written manual with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc.  The most recent hazard review was conducted on Janauary 12, 2000.  There were no major hazards identified during this review (facility is less than five years old).  To aid in the prevention of releases, this facility uses standard operating procedures (SOPs) and maintenance procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, and alarms and procedures.  The operating and training procedures were initially reviewed and updated when the system was installed in July of 1995, and were last reviewed and/or updated on January 12, 2000 during a visit by Environmental Data Services, Inc.  The refrigeration maitenance technicians of Prairieland Processors, Inc. are trained in the classroom and by on-the-job training.  The traininig is completed by demonstration and observation of working knowledge of the system.  The visit by Environmental Data Services, Inc. prompted a review of safety, training, and maintenance operations at Prairieland Processors, Inc.  Although prevention is a necessity when handling chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia, accidents can occur.  There have been no reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia from this system since its operational startup in 1995.  Employees who are trained in the proper procedures (SOP & Maintenance) of the ammonia refrigeration system are knowledgeable in the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Manual provided by the manufacturer.  Employees follow the start-up procedures to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  The last review/revision of maintenance procedures was completed when the refrigeration system was installed.  However, during a visit by Environmental Data Services, the maintenance procedures were reviewed (January 12, 2000).  Maintenance employees have a daily check sheet which they use to check for conditions which may cause the release of ammonia from the system.  Different componenets of the refrigeration system are checked (visual) on a daily basis to ensure proper operations and performance.  Compressors, assumulators, condensors, receivers, cold rooms, and prugers of the system are checked by this list.  The list has several different aspects of each componenets of the system.  For instance, the compressors are checked for Suction Pressure, Suction Temperature, Discharge Pressure, Discharge Temperature, Oil Pressure, Oil Temperature, etc.  If any items noted on the checklist are not within the recommended operating limits, the maintenance personnel determine the cause and correct the problem utilizing the manufacturer's recommendations in the O&M Manual.  Clyde Varner and Monte Pool help to oversee any maintenance conducted on the system.  Prairieland Processors, Inc. contracted Environmental Data Services, Inc., which triggered a review of our safety information, operating and maintenance procedures and training.  Prairieland Processors, Inc. is a Level 3 Prevention Program facility, and is implementing Process Safety Management at this location to help in the prevnetion of accidental of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from this system.",

Anhydrous ammonaia is considered hazardous by EPA, OSHA, etc.  The same properties which makes anhydrous ammonia valusble as a cold storage chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain precaustions when handling and using anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration purposes.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and use anhydrous ammonia combined with the operations and maintenance procedures provided by the manufacturer of the ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the training of our employees.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is meat processing from carcass.  To aid in the quality of our process, we utilize an ammonia refrigeration system for cooling and freezing of our product.  The refrigeration system supplies several room throughout the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is condensed and cooled through the utilization of the refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia is liquified under pressure in the storage vessel which is located on the ground (north side of building) behind the maintenance room.  This liquid ammonia is condensed and cooled through the ustilization of the refrigeraion system.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the system is 15,400 pounds.\n\nOur employees (maintenance) conduct proper start-up procedures as listed in the manufacturer's Operation & Manitenance manual for the refrigeration system.  These personnel also review the operating procedures and maintenance tasks, when needed, to insure the proper and safe use of the ammonia in the refrig"

Maintenance personnel on staff assist in the mechanical integrity and general maintenance up-keep of the system.  The facility has a Process Safety management Plan which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program Requirements under EPA/RMP requirements; and to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements.  Prairieland Processors, Inc. also has a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication program, Confined Space program (if needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  These programs, along with the Process Safety Management program comprises a large portion of Prairieland Processors' prevention program.\n\nThe emergency response (action) program was developed with the assisatance of Environmental Data Services, Inc., the Arkansas City Fire Department, and the Cowley County LEPC.  If an anhydrous ammonia release occurs at the 604 Goff location, employees will notify Emergency Maintenance personnel on duty to inform them of a release.  Maintenance employees will determine the extent of a release, and take other notifiaction/evacuation procedures if the release warrants such action.  The emergency action plan consists of maintenance personnel isolating the release point by shutting off supply valves to the affected release point, or by a manual shutdown of the entire refrigeration system if necessary.  If this action does not stop/mitigate the release of ammonia, evacuation/mitigation procedures will begin with the notification to Ar"

The 911 cal should have been made by this time to notify emergency response agencies (Arkansas City Fire Dept., and Cowley County LEPC)  of the release, and to start mitigation/evacuation prcedures of the system and affected population.\n\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of the storage vessel and all ammonia in the system.  This would result in a release of 15,400 pounds of ammonia liquid and/or vapor into the atmosphere.  Active mitigation was considered for this release scenario, however, in a worst case scenario, all efforts and shutoff devices would fail.  This release would result in a distance to endpoint of 1.6 miles.  The area surrounding the facility is considered rural based on the flat terrain, and little obstructions in the immediate area.  The worst case scenario would impact approximately 942 persons in the entire 1.6 mile radius.  This is the entire are, and does not reflect actual numbers due to wind direction.  This information was determined by the use of RMP Comp, and Landview software programs.\n\nThe alternate release scenario was completed for this facility based on the most probable type of equipment failure which could occur at this facility.  A valve packing failure could result in a release of anhydrous ammonia.  The amount of ammonia released would be small based on the liquid line sizes throughout the facility.  This valve packing failure could result in the release of 75 pounds of ammonia into the atmosphere in a 15 minute time frame.
