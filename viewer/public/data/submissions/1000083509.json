      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nNEP Holdco, LLC (\"Beaver Falls facility\" \"Beaver Falls, LLC\") owns and operates a combined cycle power generation facility in Beaver Falls, New York. The plant utilizes aqueous ammonia in a 29% concentration for use in its Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system located within the HRSG to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from the combustion turbine exhaust gas.\n\n\n\nThe 29% aqueous ammonia injected into the HRSG is stored in a 9,980 gallon vertical storage tank surrounded by a containment dike capable of containing the entire contents of the storage tank and related piping. The allowable working capacity of the tank is 8,982 gallons.  Aqueous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank to an ammonia skid located within the building. The aqueous ammonia is vaporized in the mixing chamber with atomizing air, then mixed with preheated air from an electric heater at the skid. The ammonia/air mixture is then blown to the injection grid. The injection grid is a simple pipe system with outlets inside the HRSG.\n\n\n\nThe generating plant is subject to U.S. EPA regulations governing Accidental Release Prevention requirements Risk Management Program under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68). This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G. This RMP certifies that the Beaver Falls facility has instituted a Risk Management Program that is in compliance with U.S. EPA Accidental Release Prevention requirements.\n\n\n\nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the format published by U.S. EPA. In addition to identifying the applicable policies and risk management systems, the RMP identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios, the potential off-site consequences of those releases, and the facility's five-year accidental release history. This RMP certifies that prevention and emergency response programs are in plac"

In addition, the Beaver Falls facility has implemented operating procedures, training, maintenance, and emergency response procedures to ensure the risks associated with plant operations are minimized and employees, nearby populations, and the environment are protected.\n\n\n\nThe Beaver Falls facility has also implemented environmental programs and procedures to ensure compliance with all environmental regulations. The program consists of the environmental permits and plans required to operate the facility.  These programs and procedures, maintained in manuals at the facility, are kept up to date and available to all plant personnel.  \n\n\n\nThe plant manager has overall responsibility for maintaining the risk management program. Safety information is maintained at the facility. Operating procedures have been implemented at the facility and address the possible conditions of the ammonia system. A maintenance program is in place and consists of maintenance procedures, testing and inspection schedules, and a work log system that tracks work and inspections performed on the ammonia system. \n\n\n\nAll personnel must complete initial and refresher training on procedures applicable to their position. All operators and maintenance personnel undergo a qualification process, which addresses ammonia system operating procedures and/or maintenance procedures along with emergency response training. Administrative personnel must undergo emergency response training. \n\n\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every three years. These audits consist of a risk management program audit and a safety review of the ammonia system. The program audit reviews the risk management program and procedures to ensure the"

      "SummaryText": " program is being implemented. The ammonia system safety review consists of an audit of the ammonia system and operating procedures and interviews with plant personnel to ensure that the ammonia system is designed and operated in accordance with the appropriate safety standards and requirements.\n\n\n\nEmployees are included in hazard reviews and incident investigations. In addition, employees participate in regular safety meetings and attend annual training in emergency response and ammonia safety.  The Beaver Falls facility has also implemented incident investigation procedures. \n\n\n\nProgram Level Identification\n\nThe Beaver Falls facility has not had an accident or off site release of ammonia. However, the \"worst case\" release, as defined by the EPA, results in concentrations at public receptors that exceed the toxic endpoint for aqueous ammonia (0.14 mg/L) as listed in Part 68, Appendix A.  Aqueous ammonia is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard nor is the process listed among the nine NAJCS codes. Thus, the Beaver Falls facility aqueous ammonia process is subject to Program 2.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe Beaver Falls facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect facility personnel and public safety, as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to an aqueous ammonia leak at the site. The program addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, accountability for all personnel in an emergency, notification of outside agencies and the public, and clean up and decontamination. In addition, the plant has written procedures for inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment. All maintenance and operations personnel receive Hazardous Materials and Emergency Response Training.  \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Beaver Falls facility is coordinated with the Lewis County LEPC. This coordination includes "

On an annual basis the facility offers access to the LEPC and Beaver Falls Fire Department to tour the plant for preplanning and hazard assessment purposes.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Beaver Falls facility has an excellent record of accident prevention and there have been no reportable accidents over the past 5 years involving the release of aqueous ammonia.\n\n\n\nPublic Access to Information\n\nThe Beaver Falls facility will make the RMP and Emergency Response Plan (ERP) available for public review as outlined in 42 U.S.C. 7414(c) and 40 CFR 1400.
