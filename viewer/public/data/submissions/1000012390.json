The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include: Process Safety Information is accessible at all times.  A hazard review has been conducted as part of the preparations for RMP Compliance.  Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.  Training is provided to all employees that operate the system. A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment. Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement program. Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.  The sterilization process is subject to the Risk Management Program at the facilities designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide.  Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, door interlock systems, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers and explosion proof electrical systems.  In addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process; and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety.  Sterigenics also has implemented a mechanical integrity program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.  In the unlikely event of a spill or a release involving ethylene oxide, Sterigenics has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire or release from the facility",

(Radian) to assist in addressing the requirements under the federal Risk Management Program as mandated in the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r )(7).  The Risk Management Program rules requires covered facilities to conduct a hazard assessment, develop a prevention and emergency response program, and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) by June 21, 1999.  Sterigenics completed an update of the orginal RMP plan by means of using the USEPA software, RMPe*Submit.  A copy of the submittal is included in Section 9.0 of this document.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nFacilities that use or store more than 10,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the US EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\n\n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n\n\n\nA?A? Introduction;\n\nA?A? Facility identification and regulated substances;\n\nA?A? Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\nA?A? Hazard Assessment;\n\nA?A? Prevention Program;\n\nA?A? Five-Year Accident History;\n\nA?A? Emergency Response Plan; and\n\nA?A? Planned Changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nSterigenics operates a contract sterilization facility located in Willowbrook.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \n\n\n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Sterigenics.

      "SummaryText": "ance released was gaseous ethylene oxide (CAS # 75-21-8). Ethylene Oxide is listed as an extremely hazardous substance (EHS). An estimated 11.9 pounds of EO was released and the reportable quantity is 10 pounds. \n\n\n\n3.)The release from sterilization Chamber B was to atmosphere through the emission stack of the facility's acid scrubber emission control system, which is located about 25 feet above grade. Because of the lengthy release period through an elevated scrubber stack, there are no anticipated adverse health impacts to employees or the general public as a result of this incident. \n\n\n\n4.) The release was caused by failure of an interlock control to prevent process emissions from being routed to the emission control system when it was not functioning properly.  Upon discovering the release of the EO excess emissions from this failed interlock on Chamber B, the facility ceased processing in Chamber B and initiated an immediate investigation into why the interlock failed to prevent these excess emissions.  Chamber B was not restarted until the interlock system was repaired and tested with a documented protocol to confirm its proper operation.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the Sterigenics EO - Willowbrook facility are coordinated with the Tri-State Fire Department and the State of Illinois Emergency Response ESDA.\n\n\n\nDepending on the quantity and chemical involved in a \"reportable spill,\" Sterigenics US LLC - Willowbrook also notifies certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of Sterigenics' activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections and regulatory requirements.  At this time, no further improvements have been ident"

      "SummaryText": "ified.  \n\nChemical-Specific Safety\n\n\n\nEthylene oxide is stored in an outdoor staging area that is cool, dry, well-ventilated and away from incompatible chemicals and sources of ignition.  Storage containers are insulated and have pressure relief valves. Lower explosive limit (LEL) sensors are located near areas of potential leaks including gas storage areas, gas charging areas, and chamber doors that will alarm with an audible alarm in the event of a major leak from the ethylene oxide cylinders or process."
