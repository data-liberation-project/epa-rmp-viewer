(Radian) to assist in addressing the requirements under the federal Risk Management Program as mandated in the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r )(7).  The Risk Management Program rules requires covered facilities to conduct a hazard assessment, develop a prevention and emergency response program, and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) by June 21, 1999.  Sterigenics completed an update of the orginal RMP plan by means of using the USEPA software, RMPe*Submit.  A copy of the submittal is included in Section 9.0 of this document.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nFacilities that use or store more than 10,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the US EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \r\n\r\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\r\n\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 Introduction;\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 Facility identification and regulated substances;\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 Hazard Assessment;\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 Prevention Program;\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 Five-Year Accident History;\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 Emergency Response Plan; and\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 Planned Changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nSterigenics operates a contract sterilization facility located in Willowbrook.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \r\n\r\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Sterigenics."

These scenarios are included within Section 3 (Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequences Analysis). \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 The release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7 Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nSterigenics US LLC- Willowbrook has had one accidental release from the ethylene oxide process within the last five years that meet this definition.  Details are provided below:\r\n\r\n1.) Date,Time and duration of accidental release: October 20, 2013 from 4:49pm to 8:15pm (3 hours & 26 minutes).  This reportable release resulted from an emission control scrubber breakdown on October 20th but the released excess emissions were not discovered until about 1:23 pm October 21, 2013.  Upon discovery of the excess emissions, the reportable release was immediately reported to the following agencies:\r\n\u00bf Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) to Paul Kattner (Case # H20131147),\r\n\u00bf Du Page County Emergency Response office, and \r\n\u00bf National Response Center (NRC) (Case # 1063583).    \r\n\r\n2) The chemical subst"

An estimated 11.9 pounds of EO was released and the reportable quantity is 10 pounds. \r\n\r\n3.)The release from sterilization Chamber B was to atmosphere through the emission stack of the facility's acid scrubber emission control system, which is located about 25 feet above grade. Because of the lengthy release period through an elevated scrubber stack, there are no anticipated adverse health impacts to employees or the general public as a result of this incident. \r\n\r\n4.) The release was caused by failure of an interlock control to prevent process emissions from being routed to the emission control system when it was not functioning properly.  Upon discovering the release of the EO excess emissions from this failed interlock on Chamber B, the facility ceased processing in Chamber B and initiated an immediate investigation into why the interlock failed to prevent these excess emissions.  Chamber B was not restarted until the interlock system was repaired and tested with a documented protocol to confirm its proper operation.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations require that response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the Sterigenics EO - Willowbrook facility are coordinated with the Tri-State Fire Department and the State of Illinois Emergency Response ESDA.\r\n\r\nDepending on the quantity and chemical involved in a reportable spill, Sterigenics US LLC - Willowbrook also notifies certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of Sterigenics' activities.
