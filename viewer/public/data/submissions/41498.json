The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n     The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous \nammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the\nsite is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized \ncontractors.  The maximum quanity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 425,000 pounds, this\nwould include the nurse tanks normally stored there.\n\n3.  The accidental release program.\n     This faility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and \nregulations.  This facility has implimented the provision of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage & Handling of\nAnhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by\nstate regulation and standards of the U.S.Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),\n29 CFR 1910.111,\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4.
