Because the processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Coalgate/Tupelo Gas Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent and minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding safety and health issues.  At the Coalgate/Tupelo Gas Plant employee involvement in safety issues is strongly promoted through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and management), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion forms, and special training programs (such as emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\r\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will provide important input to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.

There are a variety of technical documents kept at the Coalgate/Tupelo Gas Plant that are used to help maintain safe operations of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, as well as equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): There is a comprehensive program at the Coalgate/Tupelo Gas Plant to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage them.  The facility primarily uses the Hazardous Operations (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience in addition to engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of each process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, when the team believes such measurements are necessary.  Periodic reviews of each process are conducted at least every 5 years and will continue on this schedule until the process is no longer operating.\r\nOperating Procedures:  Coalgate/Tupelo Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address the different modes of processing operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed at least annually so that they can be certified as current and accurate.  The review and certif"

New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years to ensure that the appropriate level of training is maintained.  All the training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\nContractors:  Coalgate/Tupelo uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work or near process equipment, there are procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of the workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This training and awareness is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):  A PSSR is conducted at the Coalgate/Tupelo Gas Plant on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that acciden"

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution and implementation.\r\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Coalgate/Tupelo Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Coalgate/Tupelo Gas Plant management for resolution and implementation.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audits are retained on file.\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at Coalgate/Tupelo within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety program to ensure that the record continues.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Action Plan (EAP), which has been reviewed with the Coalgate/Tupelo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and accepted by the Emergency Management District Direc"
