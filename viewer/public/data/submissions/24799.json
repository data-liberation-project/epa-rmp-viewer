Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Hamilton Co/Region 5, Iowa LEPC will be made.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the  hazards associated with human health and the enviroment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals(ie.,Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Williams, Iowa location is Eldon Kalous,regional location manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals(with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n     Eldon Kalous, Regional location manager\n     Work:      ( 515)-859-3346\n     24-hour:  (515)-859-7569\n\n     Brad Schweiger, Agronomy Sales\n     Work:     (515)-854-2735\n     24-hour (515)-854-2316\n\n(2) Facility Information: PRAIRIELAND COOPERATIVE, WILLIAMS, IOWA IS A   STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT FOR THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe systems cons"

      "SummaryText": "ists of storage tanks with asssociated piping,valves,liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis(spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee(FTE) numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months(1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one(1).\n\n(3) THE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n     (a) The worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) 12,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity) by design standard and administrative controls, resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 2.6 miles.\n     (b) The alternative release scenario involves the  delivery vehicle pulling away from the 1 inch line  without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.3 mile.\n\n(4) GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all appicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1 and state law. The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), Standard for the \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The OSHA Standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see  Section 8.3(b). \n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, the Williams Volunteer Fire Department has had the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health"
