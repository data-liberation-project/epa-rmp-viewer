      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAt Cognis Corporation's Cincinnati, Ohio manufacturing plant, protection of employees, the public and the environment is considered to be the most important responsibility.  A key element of the plant's protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, plant personnel are prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\nThe plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from local emergency response organizations.\n\nThe plant's Risk Management Program (RMP) plan was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP plan describes the incidents that would have the most catastrophic effects (the \"worst-case release scenarios\") and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (\"alternative release scenarios\"). Although it is technically infeasible for the worst-case release scenarios described in this plan to occur, the information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to incidents of lesser magnitude, which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using RMP*Comp (Ver 1.07), which was developed by U. S. EPA for accidental chemical release modeling.\n\nCOGNIS CORPORATION\n\nCognis Corporation, which was previously part of Henkel Corporation, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the worldwide Henkel Group in January 2000.  In November 2001, it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cognis Deutsch"

Cognis also provides solutions for a number of other industries, such as coatings and inks, lubricants, textiles, plastics, agriculture and mining.  The company as a whole has almost 9,000 employees and operates in close to 50 different countries.  The US affiliate has almost 1400 employees, with approximately 900 of them located at its four manufacturing facilities.   \n\nCognis Corporation voluntarily participates in the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care initiative, and its manufacturing facilities are certified under the ISO 14000 Environmental Management System Standard.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe policy at Cognis Corporation's Cincinnati plant is to prevent all releases of potentially harmful substances.  Senior management is responsible for release prevention and response programs, and considerable time and resources have been invested in this effort.  \n\nThe plant has detailed procedures to ensure that safety is considered in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of each process.  Plant personnel receive regular safety training, and employee input is solicited on every aspect of safety performance improvement.  Failure to follow safety policies is grounds for dismissal.\n\nIf a release were to occur, trained personnel would control and contain the release.  The standard procedure is to technically evaluate each situation, identify potential on-site and off-site impacts, evacuate or shelter employees as necessary, contain the release and contact the local fire department to control the release and minimize its consequences.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE \n\nThe Cognis Corporation's Cincinnati, Ohio plant is a che"

A variety of processes are operated at the plant to produce 370 different products derived from animal fat or vegetable oil.  The plant, originally constructed in 1885, is situated on 105 acres of land.  Of this, about 70 acres have been developed. Part of the plant is located in the City of Cincinnati and part is located in the City of St. Bernard.  The two parts are separated by the Mill Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River.  Fatty acids and fatty alcohols are the major products produced at the Cincinnati plant.  Glycerin, esters and surfactants are also produced.  These products are used in household and industrial cleaners, personal care products, biodegradable synthetic lubricants, adhesives, agricultural products, plasticizers, and other special applications.  \n\nThe plant is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety regulations and is regularly inspected by agency representatives.  The following activities are specifically regulated:\n\n? Air emissions - permits issued by Ohio EPA,\n? Wastewater - discharge permit issued by the Metropolitan Sewer District,\n? Oil spill prevention - subject to OPA-90 regulations,\n? Storm water - permit issued by Ohio EPA,\n? Hazardous waste management - U. S. EPA ID# OHD093903235,\n? Process safety - subject to OSHA Process Safety Management Rule,\n? Emergency planning - subject to SARA 311/312 reporting, and\n? Toxic chemical release reporting - subject to SARA 313 reporting (ID # 45232 HNKLC4900E).\n\nDESCRIPTION OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Cincinnati plant handles two chemicals in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP regulations.  Ammonia, which is regulated as toxic substance, is used as a refrigerant in the Solvent Separation process.

(EPA ID # 1000 0001 8358). The system is completely owned, operated and maintained by Air Products but is located on property owned by Cognis Corporation and within the fence line of a Cognis operating facility. The Hydrogen stored within the system is supplied to the Cognis facility. The dual reporting is by mutual consent of both companies.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \n\nFollowing U. S. EPA guidance, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA included both worst-case release scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Considering the design of the regulated processes and the plant's accident prevention programs, it is virtually impossible for the WCSs to occur.  Although it is highly unlikely that the ARSs would ever occur, the ARSs represent release scenarios that are at least somewhat feasible. \n\nThe main objective of the OCA was to determine the furthest distance (called the endpoint distance) at which certain conditions might exist as a result of an accidental chemical release.  Most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences are possible.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Cincinnati plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  The RMP regulations require companies to report all significant releases from regulated processes that occurred during the past five years.  The plant has not had any releases subject to reporting.  There have been a few small chemical releases, but none of them had an offsite impact.  Plant personnel are available to answer any related questions.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STE"

Since processes at the plant that are regulated under the RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Cincinnati plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cincinnati plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards. For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for certain process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) maintained in the process operating procedures.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates the hazards associated with a "

Implementation of mitigating options in response to a PHA is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least once every five years, and they will continue to be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and is provided to other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n? Perform their work in a safe manner, \n?

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nPSSR's are also conducted after the completion of Maintenance Turnaround. The Maintenance Turnaround PSSR is completed before maintenance is released from the shutdown and before the plant is restarted. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure or human error.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Cincinnati plant has safety features on many units to help detect, contain/control, and reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n? Chemical detectors with alarms,\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n? Scrubbers to neutralize chemical releases,\n? Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated),\n? Automated shutdown systems to a process if an upset condition occurs (e.g., high level, high temperature),\n? Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases,\n? Redundant equipment and instrumentation,\n? Emergency backup power supply for critical controls,\n? Special classified electrical equipment in areas where flammable chemicals are used,\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n? Fire suppression and extinguishing systems,\n? Trained emergency response personnel,\n? Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus), and\n? Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Cincinnati plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accident"

      "SummaryText": "ally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response; including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the proper use of that equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based upon modifications made to the plant processes or other plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Cincinnati plant is coordinated with the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) as well as the Cincinnati and St. Bernard fire departments and other area businesses.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\nADDITIONAL EMERGENCY CONTACTS (supplement to Section 1.8)\n\nCognis' Cincinnati plant has a total of four (4) Shift Superintendents that, while they are on duty, have the responsibility of being the Emergency Contact. The additional Shift Superintendents that serve as Emergency Contacts are as follows:\n\nNames: Jack Barker, Patrick Harrison, Paul Horning\nPhone: (513) 482-2315\n24-hr phone: (513) 607-1555\nEmail Addresses: jack.barker@cogni"
