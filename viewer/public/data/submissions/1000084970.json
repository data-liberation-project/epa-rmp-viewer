The plan satisfies the required elements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  Specifically, the RMP includes anhydrous ammonia as a Program 2 chemical.  Patheon API Inc. has installed three ammonia refrigeration systems (chillers) at the Regional Energy Center (REC).  Each chiller unit contains approximately 5,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and ER Policies\n\n\n\nPatheon API Inc. has implemented environmental and safety systems in order to minimize the potential release of anhydrous ammonia.  These systems include: a complete system review and hazards analysis, detailed safety and environmental standards, a fully automated process control system (PLC) with built in safety interlocks, management of change program, pre-start up safety reviews and an on-going inspection and preventive maintenance program.  Prior to the start of a new chiller, all affected personnel are trained on the hazards, the safe use, storage, handling and emergency response procedures for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n    Facility Description and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPatheon API Inc. is an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility located in Florence, South Carolina.  The property is a 1,400 acre site of which approximately 120 acres have been developed for industrial use.  The developed portion is located in the center of the property, ensuring a significant buffer or distance to the property boundary.\n\n\n\nPatheon API Inc. has installed three ammonia refrigeration systems (chillers) at the Regional Energy Center (REC).

Each chiller is located in a separate chiller bay and contains 5,000 pounds of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia leak, the emergency ventilation system will be activated.  During this period, room ventilation will increase from approximately 2,000 CFM to 17,500 CFM and will exhaust to an ammonia scrubber.  The emergency scrubber system will remove vapors and aerosols generated from an ammonia leak.  The scrubber system consist of one packed-bed scrubber with liquid reservoir and redundant transfer pumps, exhaust fans, instrumentation and controls.  Each chiller enclosure has two alarm panels and a safety PLC.  The PLC monitors the ammonia sensors, damper limit and temperature switches.  In the event of an ammonia release from the chiller, the ammonia gas detection begins to alarm (white light) at 15 ppm ammonia, resulting in the start up of the scrubber.  At 35 ppm ammonia concentration in the bay, a second (yellow) indication light is initiated and the scrubber continues to run.  At 200 ppm ammonia concentration, an audible alarm and red indication light is activated.  At this point, the chiller is shutdown.  If the ammonia concentration in the bay reaches 9,500 ppm, power is automatically shutdown to the bay.  During this entire sequence, operating personnel continually monitor the equipment operations.  \n\n\n\nAdditional accidental release controls include the installation of a chiller bay sump and liquid pump out system to either a waste tank or diffusion tank.  This secondary containment ensures released ammonia is routed to a safe location.  Each chiller bay is constructed of 2 hour rated fire walls in order to minimize the impact of a potential fire within the chiller bay.  Cameras have been installed in each chiller bay and are remotely monitored by operating personnel at the REC Control Room during routine or emergency s"

This significantly reduces or minimizes the impact of a chemical release to the nearby community.  The hazard assessment was completed using the RMP*Comp Methodology.  \n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario \n\n \n\nThe worst case release scenario for the site was evaluated following all Risk Management Program regulations as required by EPA.  The identified worst case scenario is a release of the entire contents of one chiller (5,000 pounds) over a ten minute period.  It is assumed the material is released and forms a liquid pool within the chiller bay sump.  Worst case conditions using very conservative assumptions include a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, atmosphereic Stability Class F, no response from on-site emergency response personnel and no safety interlocks or devices.  Input of the preceding parameters into the the RMP*Comp program indicates that the ammonia would impact 0.7 miles from the release point.  See section 3 of the RMP submit report for more detailed information on this release scenario.\n\n  \n\nAlternative Release scenario\n\n \n\nThe Patheon API Inc. site has completed one alternate release scenario per 40 CFR Part 68.165(a)(2).  The alternative release scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines provided in ?68.22 and ?68.28. The alternative scenario assumes that all 5,000 pounds of ammonia in a chiller are released, but that it is released through an installed safety relief device, an ammonia scrubber.  The scrubber design removal efficiency is 99%.  Conditions for the alternate case include a wind speed of 3.0 m/sec, atmospheric stability class D, with no response from on-site emergency response personnel.  Input of the preceding parameters into the the RMP*Comp program indicates that the ammonia would impact 0.1 mil"

Patheon API Inc. will maintain a five year accident history for all accidental releases from the ammonia process that results in death, injury, property damage on site or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuation, shelter in place, property or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n    The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nPatheon API Inc. maintains a complete emergency response program and plan for all process operations and functions at the site.  The purpose of the site emergency response plan is to establish actions that would be taken in the event of an emergency condition.  The procedures outlined in the plan include the elements outlined in 40 CFR 68.95(a)and will be followed in the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia from the facility.  The Incident Command System (ICS) has been established in order to provide for the orderly and consistent leadership during an emergency situation.  All Hazardous Materials Responders are trained to the technician Level as outlined in the OSHA Standard and have been trained on the properties and hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia release within one of the chiller bays, a fully automated emergency relief system (ammonia scrubber) has been installed in order to mitigate a release.  During routine and emergency situations, the ammonia chillers are monitored by operating personnel on a continuous basis.
