      "SummaryText": "The Chattahoochee Energy Facility (CEF) is a 520 MW combined-cycle combustion turbine power plant located contiguous to the existing Hal B. Wansley coal-fired plant in Heard County, Georgia.  Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC) constructed and operates this plant on behalf of electric membership cooperatives (EMC).\n\nTo minimize the formation of oxides of nitrogen (Nox), CEF includes a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control system.  The SCR system at CEF uses 29.4 weight % aqueous ammonia, stored in a 16,000 gallon tank, which equates to approximately 34,000 lbs of ammonia.  Release from the storage tank has been identified as the worst-case release.  The storage tank is surrounded by a dike that would fully contain the tank in the event of a total release from a full tank.\n\nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using the OCA Guidance equations and tables, and with the SCREEN3 model.  The impact distance from the OCA Guidance tables and equations shows a distance of 0.3 miles, and the more refined SCREEN3 model results in an impact distance of 0.21 miles.  Both of these results are well within the boundary distance of 0.6 miles, and thus no offsite receptors are impacted.\n\nThere is no accident history for this site.  In addition, the Wansley property includes an extensive alarm system and access to the site is managed from two controlled locations.  Lastly, the site has its own written emergency response plan that includes actions to be taken upon accidental release of ammonia, procedures for informing the public and local responding agencies about an accidental releases, and information about emergency health care.  The facility has coordinated its emergency response with local responders, including the West Georgia LEPC.\n\nCEF meets the three criteria for a Program 1 process.  \n1.  The potential worst-case scenario endpoint is on property and does not impact offsite receptors.\n2.  There have been no ammonia accidents with "
