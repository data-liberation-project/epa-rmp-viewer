First of all, we have changed plant managers necessitating this revision to the RMP.  Secondly, we increased our concentration of Methylamine from 40% to 50% in our Butanediols operating unit.)\n\nAt the Lyondell ? Channelview Plant (CVOS) we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes to protect our employees, the public, and the environment.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure continued operations with protection in environmental, health and safety (EHS) protection in mind.  This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to prevent or eliminate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance, however, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release.   We are also coordinated with the Houston area?s Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) organization, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source  and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility produces a number of products that include Propylene Oxide (PO), Styrene Monomer (SM), Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), Polyether Polyols (Polyols), and an assortment of products from the Butanediols (BDO) unit, including Allyl Alcohol (AA).  There are two POSM units, one MTBE unit, one Polyols unit, and one BDO unit.  These operating units utilize the following chemicals that have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of their su"

PO is the major product of the CVOS facility and is also a feedstock for the Polyols and BDO production units.\n\nAllyl Alcohol (AA): Approximately 4.5 million lbs. are on-site based on storage and production.  AA is a product produced in the BDO unit.\n\nEthylene Oxide (EO): Approximately 1.5 million lbs. are stored and used on-site.  EO is a primary feedstock of the Polyols unit.\n\nAnnhydrous Ammonia (NH3): Approximately 140,000 lbs. of NH3 are stored on-site to be utilized in the control of Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) in the Utilities area.  The NH3 storage is in final construction for start-up in late July ? August, 2004 timeframe and is therefore included on this submission.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropylene: Approximately 950,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  Propylene is the primary feedstock for both of the PO units.\n\nPropane: Approximately 75,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  Propane is a chemical used in the manufacture of PO.\n\nMethylamine (MA): Approximately 925,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  The Methylamine is stored in an aqueous solution that is approximately 50% MA and 50% water.  MA is a feedstock in the BDO unit.\n\nEthylene:  Approximately 70,000 lbs. are contained in a pipeline and is used as a primary feedstock for the production of Ethylbenzene in the two POSM units.\n\nIsobutylene: Approximately 414,000 lbs. are contained in a surge drum in the MTBE unit.  Isobutylene is an intermediate chemical used in the production of MTBE.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\nRegulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nWorst-Case Scenario ?

Addiitonally, this facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict internal engineering standards as well as is subject to the requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119 ? Process Safety Management.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, kept up-to-date, and made available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs): A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or changes to existing processes at the design stage, with the overall thougth of identifying and mitigating HSE issues before installation or operation.  Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews and recommend corrective actions to prevent accidents.\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly thru a review during any SOP training opportunity.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified after completed of a process PHA.  Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a process unit.\n\nOperator Training / Certification Program: CVOS has a training and testing program that ensures that operators have the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.  Periodic operator re-certification is required.\n\nComputerized Process Simulation: Computerized simulation programs are used for training and troubleshooting and include emergency shutdown and start-up simulations.\n\nMaintenance Pr"
