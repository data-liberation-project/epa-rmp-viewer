Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews and recommend corrective actions to prevent accidents.\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly thru a review during any SOP training opportunity.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified after completed of a process PHA.  Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a process unit.\n\nOperator Training / Certification Program: CVOS has a training and testing program that ensures that operators have the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.  Periodic operator re-certification is required.\n\nComputerized Process Simulation: Computerized simulation programs are used for training and troubleshooting and include emergency shutdown and start-up simulations.\n\nMaintenance Pr"

Each operating area also has a representative on the Plant Safety Committee.\n\nContractor Safety Program: The plant has a program to ensure that contractors are properly trained, and uses the Houston Area Contractors Association as a tool to provide the basic HSE training required of a contractor prior to entering a chemical manufacturing facility.  All contractor employees must attend the Houston Area Contractors Association training and be certified through examination prior to arriving at the plant.  In addition to basic training CVOS site specific training is required prior to arriving at the plant.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of substances regulated under the RMP rule at this facility over the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nCVOS maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
