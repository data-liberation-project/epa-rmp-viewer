The Hutchinson Rail Terminal complies with National Fire Protection Association NFPA-58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code requirements for LP-Gas Storage, NFPA 30 Flammable Liquids Code, and it is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy to notify the Reno County Office of Emergency Management and the Hutchinson City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:  The Hutchinson Terminal is a bulk liquefied petroleum gas terminal that can receive natural gas liquids (NGLs), butanes, propane, and other hydrocarbon products via pipeline.  Butanes, and propane are stored at the Hutchinson Rail Terminal and loaded on railcars for distribution to customers. Due to the nature of operations and storage of flammable substances for the facility, the quantity of flammable substances stored at the facility can fluctuate and be composed of a variety of the regulated substances reported. Current operations also allow for the storage of a single regulated substance. As such, the facility has conservatively reported the potential max quantity of any single regulated substance (Mixed NGLs, Butane, and Propane) stored at the facility at any which point. It should be noted that the facility will not intend to store all of the regulated flammable substances at max quantities simultaneously due to limitations in storage vessels.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal has developed and implemented the all the element"

The process safety information includes the hazards of chemicals used or produced in the process, process technology information, and process equipment data.  The process safety information is updated whenever process changes are made using management of changes and pre-startup safety reviews.  Accurate and complete process safety information enables the Hutchinson Rail Terminal employees involved in operating and maintaining the terminal to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  Process safety information is used to conduct process hazard analysis on the existing process or a proposed modification to a process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal is committed to performing a detailed hazard analysis of each covered process to identify, evaluate, and control hazards involved in the processes.  Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\nThe Hutchinson Rail Terminal uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and check list PHA methodologies, which are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, engineering expertise and PHA facilitator training.

The Hutchinson Rail Terminal has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner.  All PHA findings and recommendation resolutions are communicated to all affected employees.  All recommendations must be resolved and documented by management.\n\nOperating Procedures (OP): The Hutchinson Rail Terminal has developed and implemented written operating procedures that describe the tasks that terminal operators and transport drivers must perform, the safe process operating parameters that must be maintained, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal written operating procedures address steps for each operating phase, including: (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround. The Hutchinson Rail Terminal written operating procedures state the operating limits including the consequences of deviation and the steps required to correct or avoid the deviation.  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal written operating procedures describe all the process safety systems and their functions.  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal written operating procedures are reviewed and certified annually for current practices and accuracy.\n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures:  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal has developed and implemented safe work practices in accordance with the OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 requirements that include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, ho"

Initial training ensures that new or reassigned personnel are trained in an overview of the process and operating procedures.  Refresher training is performed at least every three (3) years to ensure that the operator understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.  Employees are tested to demonstrate their understanding of the training and competency.\n\nContractors:  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal has developed and implemented a program to ensure that contractors used to supplement its workforce to perform maintenance, renovation or specialty work on or near RMP / PSM covered processes are qualified to perform the work and are informed of the potential hazards.  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal personnel monitor the contractor activities throughout all maintenance, renovation or specialty work on or new RMP / PSM covered processes.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR):  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal requires a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) to be performed and documented for any physical modification in the PSM covered processes.  Additionally, any new units added at the Hutchinson Rail Terminal which is considered PSM covered processes will also require a PSSR to be performed and documented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal has developed and implemented procedures to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of critical process equipment in accordance with National Fire Protection Association NFPA-58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code requirements for LP-Gas Storage and industry recognized and generally accepted"
