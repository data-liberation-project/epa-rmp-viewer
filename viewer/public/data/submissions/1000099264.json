In the event of a liquid ammonia leak, the king\n\nvalves (outlet of the high pressure liquid receiver) can be closed automatically or manually to prevent flow of\n\nammonia liquid to downstream equipment. The system can be shutdown by the computer control system or by\n\ntwo emergency stop stations located: 1. In the engine room at the north exit; and, 2.Outside the engine room\n\nback door. In addition, ammonia sensors located in the engine room and in all ammonia refrigerated areas can shutdown\n\nthe ammonia system when ammonia concentrations reach unacceptable PPM levels (>15PPM).\n\nThe facility is equipped with a sprinkler system.\n\nResponse Capabilities\n\nThe facility is an evacuation only facility with trained maintenance staff that can assist fire department / haz-mat responders in a limited manner.\n\nAmmonia System Summary\n\nMajor equipment components include:\n\n5 Compressors\n\n51 Evaporators\n\n2 Evaporative Condensers\n\n1 Purger\n\n3 Liquid Recirculators\n\n6 Ammonia Pumps\n\n1 High Pressur"
