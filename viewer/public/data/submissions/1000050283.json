A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site makes use of the Clayton County Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \r\n\r\n1.2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 1361 Southern Road, Morrow, Georgia. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\r\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce.  \r\n\r\n1.3.\tRelease Scenarios\r\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the volume of the single High Pressure Receiver (a maximum of (12,196 lbs) .  No administrative controls and mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 1.2 miles.\r\nThe alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia from a ruptured evaporator coil caused by thermal expansion due to double blocking of the line.  The largest-condenser coils (EC-1 and EC-2) were assumed and a volume of 2,357 lbs of ammonia were used for release calculations.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario even though line lockout/tagout"
