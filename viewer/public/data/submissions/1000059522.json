The UPI property occupies approximately 490 acres. It is bordered by the New\r\nYork Slough of the San Joaquin/Sacramento River on the north and by open space and industrial facilities in\r\nall other directions. The nearest residences are located approximately 3/4 miles to the southwest of any\r\nfacilities handling chemicals regulated under the RMP Rule.\r\n\r\nThe plant employs approximately 640 people.

We expect all employees to take responsibility for their own safety, the safety of others, and be accountable for their own actions.\r\n\r\nUPI has a long-standing commitment to business principles which promote the safe, ethical operation of its steel manufacturing facilities in Pittsburg, California. These principles have resulted in clear UPI business strategies that call for continual improvement of safety, quality, customer satisfaction, protection and preservation of the environment, and community responsibility. Implementation of, and adherence to, these business strategies requires the full commitment of all UPI employees.

Documentation of the training is forwarded to the Safety Department for filing and tracking.\r\nIn addition to on-the-job training, UPI personnel are trained in basic safety courses on an ongoing basis. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nUPI's Emergency Response team consists of Fir"

      "SummaryText": "st Responders, Emergency Response Team and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).\r\n\r\nFirst Responders are trained to be first on the scene and assist in the event of an emergency. First Responders attend monthly training to keep their skills current.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Team consists of First Responders who receive more specialized, in-depth training including confined space rescue, hazmat training and firefighting. This group works with the UPI Fireman and EMTs on all phases of emergency response.\r\n\r\nEmergency Medical Technicians are onsite 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our certified EMT's duties also include emergency dispatch, rescue, medical treatment, patient transport, security and onsite training.\r\n\r\nUPI conducts 4 emergency situational drills per month for emergency preparedness.  Some of the drills conducted include the Contra Costa Fire department in a continual effort to keep our close relationship with the outside agencies. \r\n\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nA review of facility incident investigation reports has shown that there have been no incidents involving\r\nAmmonia or other hazardous substances, for which the onsite or offsite consequences exceeded the\r\nreporting requirements of RMP EPA, CFR Part 68.42.\r\nFollowing a significant incident of a covered RMP process (anhydrous ammonia or liquid hydrogen), UPI will\r\nupdate the accident history to reflect the incident. This is intended to help EPA and other agencies identify\r\nthe need for technical assistance, and a timely update to the accident history will provide information to\r\nprevent  similar incidents in industry.  UPI saves articles of Ammonia incidents in the industry for the purpose of generating What If questions for the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe changes that UPI has implemented since the first submittal of the RMP in 1999 have resulted in a 26% decrease in the toxic worst-case scenario distance for anhydrous ammonia.
