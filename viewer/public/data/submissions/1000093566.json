The digestion plant uses feedstock types of agricultural crop residues (Type 1) and manure (Type 2) to produce Biomethane which is injected into a commercial pipeline for use in producing renewable Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). The RMP regulated substance at the SNE Junction City facility is methane. \r\nThe RMP-covered process at the facility is the Biomethane production process. This includes the digester feed system, digesters, digestate storage tanks, post digestion gas holders, gas upgrading system, and associated pumps, piping, and flare.\r\nFor the purposes of RMP reporting, methane is classified and modeled as a flammable gas. The quantity of methane in the system is documented in an inventory excel spreadsheet maintained by the facility, which includes the masses of methane in all vessels and interconnected piping. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nShell endeavors in all its activities to promote a quality environment. We recognize that activities at this facility may impact our employees and the surrounding community. Because of this, Shell is dedicated to environmental protection, employee health and safety, regulatory compliance and pollution prevention through a strategy of continual improvement and teamwork.\r\n\r\nOur company environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this facility, our employees, and the public. This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. Shell is committed to complying with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations, Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, ha"

This program enables the facility to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of methane.\r\n\r\nIt is Shell's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment. Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe Shell New Energies, Junction City, Oregon - Biogas Facility located at 92757 State Hwy 99, Junction City, Oregon conducts a biogas production process that generates methane (74-82-8). The facility is classified as a Prevention Program 3 and is regulated by EPA RMP and OSHA PSM for the flammable substance methane which is held on site in excess of 10,000 lbs. \r\n\r\nPotential Release Scenarios\r\nThe RMP models one worst-case scenario and two alternative-case scenarios. The worst-case scenario was prepared according to the regulations in 40 CFR Part 68.25(b), which states the following:\r\nThe worst-case release quantity shall be the greater of the following:\r\n1)\tFor substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity;\r\n2)\tFor substances in pipes, the greatest amount in a pipe, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.\r\nBy regulation, for flammables such as methane, the reasonable worst-case scenario is a vapor cloud explosion.\r\n\r\nFor the facility, the worst-case scenario vapor cloud explosion was considered to result from a rupture of the digestant tank, resulting in spilling of nearly the entire tank's methane storage or 8,106 pounds of methane. The endpoint used was an overpressure of one pound per square inch (psi) and at a distance of 0.20 miles. Within that distance, public receptors are limited to one residence, in addition to commercial/office/industrial areas. No environmental receptors ar"

The worst-case scenario capacity of methane is a maximum; usually three meters of digestate, a non-flammable liquid normally present in the Post-Digester that limits the quantity of methane to 5,849 pounds or less.\r\n\r\nThe RMP also considers alternative-case scenarios, which are events more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. The alternative case scenarios were prepared according to the regulations in Title 40 CFR Part 68.28(e) as follows:\r\nThe owner or operator shall consider the following in selecting alternative release scenarios: \r\n(1) The five-year accident history provided in \u00a768.42; and \r\n(2) Failure scenarios identified under \u00a768.50 or \u00a768.67.\r\n\r\nFor the facility, the first alternative-case scenario (ARS 1) was considered a vapor cloud fire resulting from the simultaneous opening of two pressure relief valves (PRVs) associated with the digestant tanks, which combined have the capacity to discharge the maximum production rate of 2,784 pounds of methane at a rate of 46.4 pounds per minute (lbs./min). The endpoint used was the lower flammability limit (LFL) at a distance of 0.1 miles. The same receptor parameters were used as in the worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe second alternative-case scenario (ARS 2) involved the puncture of piping/tubing associated with the Finished Bio-gas Product pipe, resulting in a \u00bd-inch hole and causing the release of up to 3,820 pounds lbs/min methane."
