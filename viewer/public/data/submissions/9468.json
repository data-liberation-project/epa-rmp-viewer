Huntsman Aromatics and Olefins (A&O) Plant is committed to achieving excellence in environmental, health and safety.  This is exemplified by the A&O Plant having earned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Star Award for excellence in safety performance.  The Huntsman A&O Plant maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman A&O Plant participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), Port Arthur Fire Department and the Sabine Neches Chiefs Association to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies. Huntsman participates in the Responsible Care. initiative at the Chemical Manufacturer's Association and are committed to the responsible management of chemicals. The Plant Manager of the A&O Plant is responsible for implementation of the risk management program (RMP).\n\n2.\tRegulated Substances.   The Aromatics and Olefins Plant is located on 230 acres at the corner of State Highway 73 and Savanna Avenue in Port Arthur, Texas and employs 275 people.  The site first opened in 1957 and was acquired by Huntsman in 1994.  The site produces as primary end products ethylene, propylene, cyclohexane and intermediates.  The A&O Plant has four processes:  the Light Olefins Unit (LOU) manufactures ethylene and propylene; the Aromatics/Cyclohexane Unit manufactures aromatics extract and cyclohexane; Utilities uses chlorine for water treatment; and the offsite tankage area operated by an adjoining plant, is included in this filing, but adds no additional chemicals other than an increased inventory of exi"

This scenario has potential off-site impact.\n\nThe toxic alternative case scenario involves a 5/16 diameter leak from a chlorine cylinder for 30 minutes (vapor release). This scenario results in no offsite impacts to public or environmental receptors.\n\nMeasures for preventing these toxic release scenarios are as follows:  Chlorine systems have automatic shut-off devices and operate under vacuum to minimize releases in the event of a pipe/tube break.  Chlorine detectors, alarms and procedures are in place to alert of a release.  Emergency chlorine cylinder repair kits are also available on site should a leak occur.  Fixed fire water monitors with trained and drilled fire responders are on site.\n\nFlammable Release Scenarios  \n\t\n\tThe Flammable Worst Case Scenario is based on EPA required assumption and is highly unlikely and has never occurred at this facility.\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario involves the complete failure of a storage tank containing a hydrocarbon mixture.  The volume of RMP chemicals in the tank is assumed to vaporize, ignite, and result in a vapor cloud explosion.   A rigorous inspection program complying with industry codes and standards, effective operator and maintenance training using procedures consistent with safe operation, and adherence to the Process Safety Management program reduce the risk of releasing the entire contents of these tanks.  This scenario has potential for offsite impacts.\n\nOverfilling the tank has been considered and safeguards implemented to reduce the chance of this scenario.

The A&O Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The A&O Plant assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Huntsman does have a Hurricane Procedure and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane and inclement weather.\n \n7 Operating Procedures\n \t\tHuntsman A&O Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \n7 Training\n \t\tHuntsman A&O Plant provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.  \n \n7 Mechanical Integrity\n \t\tHuntsman A&O Plant has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage"

The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \n7 Management of Change\n \t\tHuntsman A&O Plant has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modification to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.\n \n7 Pre-Startup Review\n \t\tHuntsman A&O Plant performs pre-startup safety reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information or is deemed as requiring more review than a Management of Change modification.  The pre-startup safety review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n \n7 Compliance Audit\n \t\tHuntsman A&O Plant performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its Process Safety Management Program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures"

The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.  \n \n7 Incident Investigation\n \t\tHuntsman A&O Plant investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman A&O Plant has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  Huntsman A&O Plant has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution.  Finally, incident reports are reviewed with all affected personnel.\n \n7 Employee Participation\n \t\tHuntsman A&O Plant has developed a written action plan for employee participation in all aspects of its Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  Huntsman A&O Plant consults with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of PHA's and on the development of other elements of the Process Safety Management Program.  Huntsman A&O Plant ensures that all employees have access to PHA's and all other process safety management information.\n \n7 Hot Work Permit\n \t\tHuntsman A&O Plant employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark producing operations).  If any hot work is performed near a covered process, Huntsman A&O Plant issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for"
