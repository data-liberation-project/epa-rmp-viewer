OxyChem is a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (\u00a7 68.155(a))\n\nOxyChem has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Muscle Shoals facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Muscle Shoals facility.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a7 68.155(b))\n\nThe OxyChem Muscle Shoals facility consists of two chemical producing plants that are either wholly owned by OxyChem, or exist as joint ventures with other companies.  OxyChem operates all plants at the site.  The facility handles one substance that is regulated by the RMP rule.  The substance is as follows:\n\nChlorine\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a7 68.155(d))\n\nThe Muscle Shoals facility\u00bfs prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures\nTraining, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change\nPre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation\nEmployee Participation, Key Procedures, Contractors\n\nEach of the items listed above are documented and mai"

These manuals are routinely updated.\n\nFive-year Accident History (\u00a7 68.155(e))\n\nThere were no RMP accidents at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program (\u00a7 68.155(f))\n\nThe Muscle Shoals facility has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (\u00bfERT\u00bf) trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (\u00bfECC\u00bf).  In addition, the Muscle Shoals facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (\u00bfSSP\u00bf) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe facility is a member of the Colbert County Local Emergency Planning Committee (\u00bfLEPC\u00bf), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (\u00a7 68.155(g))\n\nThe Muscle Shoals facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.\n\nCertification Statement\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\nOriginal on Cover Letter                                                     \n--------------------------------------------------                          ----------------------------------------------------\nSignature"
