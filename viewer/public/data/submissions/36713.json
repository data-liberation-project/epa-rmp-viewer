      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. The facility policy for accidental release prevention:\n\nThis facility handles anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  Anhydrous ammonia is a valuable tool used in production agriculture as cost effective fertilizer.  The management and employees of SEK GRAIN, INC. are committed to the safe handling and prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for retail sale to area farmers.  \nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to area fields as fertilizer.\nThe maximum stored quantity would be 158,000 lbs. in our two-18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport tanker holding 40,000 lbs.  \n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 160,000 lbs., which represents the volume of the storage tankS at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to .14 mg/l) is 6.9 miles.(RMP Comp model)\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to .14 mg/l) is .20 miles. (RMP Comp model)\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Sotrage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammoina, K-61.1,\" published by The American National Standards Ins"

The Five year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidents.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\nThe Facility has:\n\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38:\n\nb.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title II (EPCRA).\n\nc.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120.  Including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nd.  Discussed program with local fire department\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed by employees and the Kansas Department of Agriculture to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
