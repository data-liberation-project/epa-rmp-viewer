The Plant is on a property covering 65 acres. RVWTP is provided State Project water stored in Castaic Lake. The plant is capable of treating 30 million gallons of water per day. Raw water is first delivered to the pre-ozone contactor where ozone is applied for pre-oxidation and pre-disinfection. Ozonated water then enters the rapid mix structure where coagulants are added. The water is then fed to up-flow clarifiers, and then to a gravity filtration system. In the final stage, filtered water is disinfected with chlorine, monitored for chlorine residual, and released to CLWA?s transmission system for distribution. Potentially hazardous chemicals that are stored and used onsite or for which storage is available include chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, diesel fuel, liquefied oxygen, and sodium hydroxide. Liquid chlorine, used for disinfection of water, is stored in one-ton cylinders. The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the plant is 16 cylinders (32,000 pounds). Chlorine is present in quantities above the RMP threshold. The other chemicals are either not covered under the RMP program, or are present in quantities below the thresholds.\n\n \n\nChemicals Subject to EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Program CLWA Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine stored in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program. Chlorine for use in disinfection operations is delivered to the plant by truck and stored onsite in one-ton cylinders. Accidental Releases During Past Five Years The CLWA Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant has not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage. Process Safety Management Accident Prevention Program The CLWA Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant is subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Managemen"

The CLWA?s PSM programs include the following activities to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n\n\n\n?  Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n\n\n\n?  Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures. All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n\n\n\n?  Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n\n\n\n?  Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same safety training that CLWA provides for its own employees.\n\n\n\n?  Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, with documentation of all inspections.\n\n\n\n?  Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n\n\n\n?  Rigorous safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n\n\n\n?  Investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine releases.\n\n\n\n?  Periodic evaluation of the safety records of all outside contractors who work on the RMP-regulated systems.\n\n\n\n?  Development of an effective emergency response program.\n\n\n\n?  Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM program, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\n\n\n\n?  Independent audits of the entire PSM program and RMP program every three years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Procedures\n\n\n\nCLWA Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant uses its Emergency Response Plan (ERP) to provide step-by-step procedures for emergency response in the unlikely event of an accidental release. The O&M Supervisor (Operations) maintains the ERP. The key elements of CLWA?s emergency preparedness program are as follows:\n\n\n\n?
