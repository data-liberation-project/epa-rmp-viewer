IN SANDY RUN, SC\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nDevro's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies show that the facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety, and adheres to all applicable regulations. The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers response procedures such as pre-emergency employee training, lines of communication and authority, emergency recognition, evacuation routes and procedures, and emergency medical treatment. It is Devro's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible release of regulated sustances.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nDevro, Inc. has one (1) regulated substance at the facility above threshold quantity. The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is used in the facility's manufacturing process. Ammonia is stored in two storage tanks, one 9,200 gallon tank and another 2,000 gallon tank. Administrative controls limit the amount of anhydrous ammonia on-site to 48,795 pounds. The facility is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements because a release would result in off-site impact, and is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nDevro, Inc. has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is already in compliance. The following steps are key to the prevention program:\n\n1. Detailed records of safety information describing chemical hazards of ammonia, process technology, and process equipment;\n\n2. Comprehensive process hazard analysis are conducted with manangement, technical personel, and operators to ensure that hazards are recognized and evaluated;\n\n3. Operating procedures were developed and implemented which describe "

Employee training program is in effect to ensure that employees at the site are properly trained, aware of ammonia safety practices, hazards, emergency procedures, and maintenance procedures; operators, technicians, and managers are trained;\n\n5. An on-going mechanical integrity program is in place to ensure continued safe process operation and physical condition;\n\n6. Incident investigation procedures are in place to ensure that unplanned events effecting process safety are properly investigated in a timely maner to identify the causes of the incident, and to implement corrective action.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDevro, Inc. has had an excellent record for preventing accidental releases over the last five years. Due to the effective release prevention policies, there have been no accidental release of ammonia of reportable quantities during the last five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nThe site has a written emergency action plan to deal with the accidental release of the covered process chemical, anhydrous ammonia, and other hazardous substances. The emergency action plan has been coordinated with local emergency response personnel. The plan contains the aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of the local emergency response groups, and the public. Devro will evacuate in the event of an emergency accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDevro, Inc. plans to continue to evaluate the regulated process as required under the PSM/RMP standards to ensure safe operations.  Devro, Inc. also plans to change the process at the plant with new technology that would reduce the amount of anhydrous ammonia needed for the process.  The process change will allow the facility to use a smaller 2,000 gallon"
