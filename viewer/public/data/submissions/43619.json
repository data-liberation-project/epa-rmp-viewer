(Evans Harvey) are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our accidental release prevention program which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Evans Harvey facility's primary activity is repackaging chemicals. Evans Harvey either repackages or warehouses 7 RMP-regulated substances at our facility.  Evans Harvey receives the regulated substances primarily in bulk and packages the products for customer distribution.  Drummed products are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  The inventories of RMP-regulated substances at the facility are dependent upon customer orders, and not all regulated substances are present on site at a given time.\nThe RMP Substances are listed below\n\nRMP Toxic Substances         CAS No.      Maximum Quantity (pounds)\n\nCyclohexylamine               108-91-8        470,000\nAcrylonitrile                 107-13-1        86,000\n\nRMP Flammable Substanc"

The RMP regulated process at the Evans Harvey facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the RMP rule.  The Program Level 3 requirements apply because the process is subject to OSHAs process safety management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119).\n\nIn performing the offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, Evans Harvey used EPA's RMP*Comp software.  \n\nRemoved Section>>>>>\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nEvans Harvey has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP rule (40 CFR 68).  A portion of the repackaging and warehouse processes at our facility are subject to OSHAs PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and Evans Harvey is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEvans Harvey maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The checklist method is used to carry out our process hazard analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of personnel with experience in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on a regular b"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Evans Harvey maintains written standard operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after maintenance.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nEvans Harvey has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  Procedural and Safety training is continuous. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nEvans Harvey carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure valves, hoses, relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and weighing devices.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Evans Harvey to manage changes in chemicals being packaged, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as needed at Evans Harvey.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nEvans "
