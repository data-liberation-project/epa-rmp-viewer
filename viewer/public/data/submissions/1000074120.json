A combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs is used to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process. \n\n\n\nControlling accidents is and will continue to be a leading focus for the company and the individual employee.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nHostess Brands, LLC - Chicago is a facility operated as a wholesale bakery located in Chicago, IL.  The facility operates one ammonia refrigeration system used to cool ingredient and freeze products.  Current anhydrous ammonia inventory consists of approximately 18,000 pounds.  The system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR1910.119) and is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA?s RM program.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nFor the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration were used for guidance.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely, but was considered as required. \n\n\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative scenario was based on more credible assumptions and the following scenario was selected from a number of possible scenarios, based on their potential to reach off-site. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCloverhill Bakery takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

Employees have complete access to the program. Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. \n\n?    Process Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the systems. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies using the What-If Technique have been conducted to look at the systems and identify potential hazards. \n\n?    Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\n?    Training:  A training program has been developed which insures that employees who directly work with the ammonia system or safety of the system are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation or safe response to the system.\n\n?    Contractors:  All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration systems.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n?    Pre-Start up Safety Review:  A pre-start up safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity:  This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration system is built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\n?    Hot Work Permits:  These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained p"
