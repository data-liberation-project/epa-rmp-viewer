One of its operations is to lease property with railroad access and provisions to park rail cars to allow the staging of rail cars of propane while awaiting offloading.  The propane from DOT compliant registered  rail cars is transferred to Department of Transportation (DOT) licensed transport trucks.  The transfer is facilitated by a mobile transloader unit, this transloader unit has all the equipment necessary to transfer propane from the rail car to the transport truck.  The transfer equipment is mounted on a truck to allow it to be secured and moved from site to site via roadways.  The transloader unit has no propane storage vessels.\r\n  \r\nThe transfer facility is located at the Service Oil Stamart facility located at 1718 Main Avenue East in West Fargo, North Dakota (the Facility).  The site is used as an operations facility for the Service Oil/Stamart Company and the site also has a shop that refurbishes passenger rail cars.  Service Oil/Stamart has agreed to lease property to Hartland Fuels LLC to allow propane transfers.  Service Oil/Stamart also has the equipment needed to transfer cars to and from the site and will provide rail car transfer services to Hartland Fuels LLC.  To perform the actual propane transfer Hartland Fuels will contract employees from Petro Serve USA to come to the site when needed and operate the transloader unit.  Qualified trucking companies will supply DOT listed transport trucks and DOT-trained truck drivers to operate the trucks to pick up the propane and deliver it to the buyer.  The transfer process will be scheduled as needed, and the transloader unit will be secured and parked on site when it is not in use. \r\n\r\nThe worst case consequence analysis involved the failure of a railcar loaded with 33,590-gallons (141,500 pounds) of LPG creating a vapor cloud with a 3.4 mph wind.  The alternate consequence analysis involved the failure of a loaded transport truck containing 6,500-"
