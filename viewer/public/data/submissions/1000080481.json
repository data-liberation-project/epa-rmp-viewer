Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action\n\n\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. It is the policy of Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC emergency action plan involves the preparation of action procedures and training of employees in evacuation and the handling of ammonia releases.\n\nWe have trained the refrigeration personnel in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and WAC 296-62, Part P (HAZWOPER).\n\n\n\nAt Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\n\n  * Prevent unnecessary human exposure \n\n  * Reduce the threat to our personnel \n\n  * Reduce the threat to the community \n\n\n\n\n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 1151 Cutler Way Zillah, WA  98953.  The facility is located in Yakima County.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC believes in the concept set forth in the General Duty Clause of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC has established polici"

Release Considerations\n\n\n\nFollowing program guidelines, a Worst Case release of ammonia was analyzed. Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) releases were considered. Both the worst and alternative cases were documented in a report. The alternative releases were in most cases releases that were of potential concern as determined in the Process Hazard Analysis of the system and facility. The information generated from the consideration of the worst and alternative releases is used in developing the emergency action plan for the facility, and for coordination with local emergency responders.  \n\n \n\n \n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\n\n  * High level of training of personnel\n\n  * Preventative maintenance program\n\n  * Written safety procedures and safety equipment\n\n  * Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\n\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC also complies with: \n\n\n\n  * OSHA's and Washington State's process safety management rule.\n\n  * Washington States safety regulations (WAC's 296-24 and 296-62), which are equal to, or more restrictive than OSHA regulations.\n\n  * IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards for good work practices.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to codes and good practices at the time of installation.  Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles. Other safety devices Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC utilizes include:\n\n\n\n  * Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n\n  * Suction trap hi-level float\n\n  * High discharge pressure shut down\n\n  * Low suction pressure shut down\n\n  * High discharge temperature shut down\n\n  * Oil pressure failure shut down\n\n  * Hi"

These procedures include but are not limited to the following procedures: \n\n\n\n  * Pre-start up procedures\n\n  * Routine operations\n\n  * Maintenance\n\n  * Response to minor releases\n\n  * Emergency action plan\n\n\n\n \n\nE. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC has not had any accidents involving ammonia in the last five years.\n\n\n\nF. Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC has established Emergency Action procedures for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing training.\n\n\n\nSafety orientation includes making all employees aware of the evacuation plan and/or the shelter in place plan.  The supervisors are provided with the contact numbers for our refrigeration personnel to coordinate either the evacuation or the shelter-in-place program.   \n\n\n\nWe have two \"Wind Tracker Wind System\" wind flags located at either end of the plant, one on top of the packing building visible from the refrigeration office and the other at the scale house, visible outdoors upwind of any potential release.  \n\n\n\nG. Planned Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC will continue to ensure that its employees assigned to work on the process receive current training. We also conduct monthly safety meetings to maintain and improve safety.\n\n"
