Worst case release scenario and alternative release scenario\r\n\r\nWORST CASE SCENARIO: Failure of one of the storage gas tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 33,917 lbs of propane/butane gas mixture. The company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of those tanks to 85%. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a vapor cloud which finds an ignition source 10% of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion. The distance to the endpoint of 1 PSI is 0.30 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative Scenario: A pull away causing failure of the fill hose. Following valves and actions would happen:\r\n-\tThe Excess flow valves would stop the flow\r\n-\tThe gate valves would shut automatically due to loss of pressure coming from the gas truck.\r\n-\tThe nitrogen nylon lines would be ripped off due to the pulling truck. By loosing the nitrogen pressure, nitrogen actuated spring-loaded valves would shut off the gas flow in the production and at the gas farm station."

In order to avoid fires and accidents SSF developed an internal safety system as follows:\r\n \tSafety concept of SSF-Production:\r\n\r\n-\tMonitored ventilation system:\tSuction. The ventilation system sucks the building air at all potential gas emission points. Thus, an accumulation of the gas is prevented and prevented the emergence of an explosive  atmosphere. \r\n\r\n-\tAir condition humidity control: \tAll buildings at SSF are equipped with an air humidification system which ensures a humidity air level of more than 40%. If this level is not reached, a security system is installed which immediately triggers an internal alarm and indicates the malfunction of this system\r\n\r\n-\tGas detection system:\tThe gas / air concentration is constantly measured and monitored in the buildings and especially around the extruder. If the gas / air concentration exceeds 20% or 40% of the LEL (lower explosion limit), various measures are taken of the individual buildings or extrusion plants).\r\n\r\n-\tAntistatic equipment\tThe extrusion lines are equipped with anti-static fans and rods (ionization blowers and bars) . These minimize static charge of the foam.\r\n\r\n-\t1 Person always required in the Building: Each production building (Bldg. 47/49) must be staffed with at least one person at all times. Thus, potential risks, fires, malfunctions at the extrusion plants can be detected earlier and countermeasures can be taken.\r\n\r\n-\tFire prevention / firefighting\tAll employees of SSF-Production are trained annually.\r\n\r\n-\tFire alarm system (ionization detector, heat detector, multi-sensor detector):\tAll Buildings are equipped with fire alarms that trigger a fire alarm in the event of a fire. The notification of the fire department is automatic. In addition, the alarm will be displayed in all halls of SSF - all trained fire fighters will go to the affect"
