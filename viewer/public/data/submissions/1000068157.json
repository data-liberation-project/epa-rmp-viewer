      "SummaryText": "1.    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nSSF production is handling propane/butane mixture which is considered hazardous by the EPA. In order to avoid fires and accidents SSF developed an internal safety system as follows:\n\n     Safety concept of SSF-Production:\n\n\n\n-    Monitored ventilation system:    Suction. The ventilation system sucks the building air at all potential gas emission points. Thus, an accumulation of the gas is prevented and prevented the emergence of an explosive  atmosphere. \n\n\n\n-    Air condition humidity control:     All buildings at SSF are equipped with an air humidification system which ensures a humidity air level of more than 40%. If this level is not reached, a security system is installed which immediately triggers an internal alarm and indicates the malfunction of this system\n\n\n\n-    Gas detection system:    The gas / air concentration is constantly measured and monitored in the buildings and especially around the extruder. If the gas / air concentration exceeds 20% or 40% of the LEL (lower explosion limit), various measures are taken of the individual buildings or extrusion plants).\n\n\n\n-    Antistatic equipment    The extrusion lines are equipped with anti-static fans and rods (ionization blowers and bars) . These minimize static charge of the foam.\n\n\n\n-    1 Person always required in the Building: Each production building (Bldg. 47/49) must be staffed with at least one person at all times. Thus, potential risks, fires, malfunctions at the extrusion plants can be detected earlier and countermeasures can be taken.\n\n\n\n-    Fire prevention / firefighting    All employees of SSF-Production are trained annually.\n\n\n\n-    Fire alarm system (ionization detector, heat detector, multi-sensor detector):    All Buildings are equipped with fire alarms that trigger a fire alarm in the event of a fire. The notification of the fire department is automatic. In addition, the alarm will be displayed in all halls of SSF - all trained fire fighters will go to the affect"

Worst case release scenario and alternative release scenario\n\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO: Failure of one of the storage gas tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 33,917 lbs of propane/butane gas mixture. The company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of those tanks to 85%. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a vapor cloud which finds an ignition source 10% of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion. The distance to the endpoint of 1 PSI is 0.30 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario: A pull away causing failure of the fill hose. Following valves and actions would happen:\n\n-    The Excess flow valves would stop the flow\n\n-    The gate valves would shut automatically due to loss of pressure coming from the gas truck.\n\n-    The nitrogen nylon lines would be ripped off due to the pulling truck. By loosing the nitrogen pressure, nitrogen actuated spring-loaded valves would shut off the gas flow in the production and at the gas farm station.\n\n"
