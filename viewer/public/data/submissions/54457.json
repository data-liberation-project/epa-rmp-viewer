The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of Pierre Foods, Inc. to conduct business in a manner that is safe to the employees, the community, and the environment. The company\u00bfs officers, managers, and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. Pierre Foods has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances. Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program. In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases.  The Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nPierre Foods, Inc. has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.
