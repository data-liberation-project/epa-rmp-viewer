Kingsburg Cogeneration Facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The facility\u00c2\u00bfs staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia for controlling NOx emissions. \n\nKingsburg Cogeneration Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Injection System. Kingsburg Cogeneration Facility\u00c2\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \nKingsburg Cogeneration Facility is a combined cycle cogeneration plant located at 11765 Mountainview, Kingsburg, CA 93631.  The total facility covers about 1.8 acres of land and includes, in addition to the cogeneration (plant), which occupies an area of approximately 50,000 square feet (sq. ft), a sugar concentration process totaling approximately 26,000 sq. ft.  \n\nThe construction of the facility began in fall 1990 on SunMaid Growers of California (SunMaid) property.  The transportation routes near the facility include Mountainview to the north, Bethel Avenue to the east, which also provides the access road and entrance to the facility, and California Route 99 immediately to the west.  The elevation of Route 99 is approximately that of the facility ground level.\nThe plant produces electrical power, and supplies steam for operation o"

The remaining electrical power, after satisfying the facility auxiliary energy needs, is sold to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E).  The plant supplies energy for cogeneration by sending steam to the concentrator process as well as supplying process steam to the thermal host.  The equipment and systems have been selected or designed specifically for the Kingsburg facility.  The plant produces a net maximum electrical output of 34.5 megawatts (MW) while supplying all necessary steam to support operation of the multiple processes.\n\nThe regulated substance manage at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum intended inventory is 57,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia and it is stored at the facility for emissions control.  Routine deliveries of anhydrous ammonia transported to the facility when it is necessary to refill the storage tank.  The anhydrous ammonia stored on site is used for controlling concentration of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the combustion flue gas from the boiler unit.  This solution is volatilized into anhydrous ammonia vapor prior to injection into the boiler.  The anhydrous ammonia is consumed by the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to convert NOx emissions into nitrogen and water.\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the ammonia injection system.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Tab 2 of the CalARP Submittal Binder.\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Two alternative release scenarios were modeled. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Tab 2 of the CalARP Submittal Binder.\n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks"

      "SummaryText": ", and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Kingsburg Cogeneration Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n\u00c2\u00bfAutomatic / Manual Shutdown\n\u00c2\u00bfAmmonia Detection and Alarms\n\u00c2\u00bfDeluge System\n\nThe history of the Kingsburg Cogeneration Facility (i.e., no CalARP-applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Injection System.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Kingsburg Cogeneration Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for the NOx abatement system.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 57,000 lbs.
