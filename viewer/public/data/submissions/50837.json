The owners, management and employees of \n   AgriServices are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release   \n   should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department , county LEPC, EPA and all other authorities to\n   mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.
