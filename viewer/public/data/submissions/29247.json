At this facility, two (2) one-ton (2,000-pounds) chlorine cylinders are interconnected to treat raw water.  Adjacent to this facility is a chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage area that at any given time may contain up to a maximum of twelve (12) one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas and twelve (12) one-ton cylinders of anhydrous sulfur dioxide gas.  In these quantities, the use and storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide exceeds the respective 2,500-pound and 5,000-pound threshold limits and requires compliance with the CAA 112(r) Risk Management Program rule.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario involves a failure of two (2) interconnected chlorine cylinders that can release a maximum of 4,000 pounds of chlorine.  These cylinders are housed within an enclosed structure that further serves to mitigate the rate of gas released to the surrounding environment.  A worst case scenario for the adjacent chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas storage area involves a release of a maximum of 2,000 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas.  These cylinders are storage in an unmanned, semi-enclosed, metal structu"

In all three scenarios, the calculated distance to a toxic endpoint is 1.30 miles.  The resulting toxic vapor cloud will reach an end-point concentration off-site, however, this facility is located in a remote location at a restricted access military installation and has no public receptors within the effective radius.  Furthermore, the facility is unmanned and worker access to the site is restricted to the change-out of empty cylinders and the transport of cylinders for use at the Water and Wastewater Treatment Plants.  \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nBased on EPA's General Guidance for Risk Management Programs, the covered processes at our facility must demonstrate compliance with the Level 1 Prevention Program requirements in 40 CFR 68.  In addition to the directives issued by the Department of the Navy, specific procedures and practices for the prevention of accidental releases are developed and maintained by PWC.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history\n\nNo reportable accidental releases have occurred at this facility within the last 5 years.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program\n\nEmergency response procedures are incorporated within a PWC Guam chlorine spill response instruction (Emergency Measures on Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Gas, PWCINST 5090.6B). This document designates responsibilities and contains detailed procedures for response, control and mitigation of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nNo additional changes are required.  Existing controls are adequate and will be revised as needed.\n\n\n\n"
