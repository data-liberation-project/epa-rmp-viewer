Our system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68). Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems. \n\n\n\nOur RMP program includes elements addressing:\n\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the system design so that our employees are fully informed.\n\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the equipment.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the system.\n\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed properly.\n\n- Contractors: We carefully screen contractors who work on our property to ensure that they have a safe work record.\n\n- Hot Work Permits: We"
