      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR ADCO PRODUCTS, INC.\n\nADCO Products, INC., a wholly owned subsidiary of ADCO Global, Inc., is a manufacturing plant located in Michigan Center, Michigan. ADCO Global, headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a manufacturer of adhesives and sealants serving customers worldwide with automotive and construction materials. \n\nADCO participates in the Responsible Care Program of the Chemical Manufacturers Association. The Community Awareness and Emergency Response Codes of Responsible Care brings chemical plants and local communities together through communications and cooperative emergency planning. The Process Safety Code of Responsible Care is designed to prevent fires, explosions and accidental chemical releases. The Code requires safety audits, inspections and maintenance programs, and safety training for employees and contract workers. Facility owners/operators are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.\n\nADCO is housed in a building of approximately 172,300 square feet in Michigan Center, Michigan. The building is situated on a 43-acre parcel, five miles east of the City of Jackson on the banks of a tributary of the Grand River in Jackson County\u00bfs Leoni Township. Boundaries are Falahee Road on the west, Page Avenue on the north, Fifth Street on the east and Flansburgh Road on the south. Within a half-mile of the facility, there is an estimated population of 1,000 people and 50 to 75 small businesses.\n\nADCO is also a member of the Jackson Area Manufacturers Association whose purpose is to help guide participating area businesses successfully through regulatory channels.\n\nThe only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance on ADCO premises is toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (TDI). Toluene diisocyanate is held in a 3,000 gallon aboveground tank (AST) in the tank farm located west of the main plant building. This AST is e"

The tank farm area is completely encompassed by a cement dike capable of containing the entire contents of any AST in the tank farm.\n\nIn case of fire, release of hazardous materials or the need to make an emergency rescue operation, emergency response coordinators and back-ups have been named for all three shifts. Department and shift supervisors, who serve as the emergency coordinators, are trained in CPR and First Aid.\n\nEmergency response coordinators are responsible for evaluating the specific emergency and notifying the appropriate organization whose assistance may be needed: such as the fire department, police department, 911 rescue, etc. Coordinators select and assign personnel to assist in any necessary evacuation, perform rescue operations, provide first aid, control in-coming and out-going pedestrian and vehicular traffic, assist outside emergency personnel as they arrive and provide technical assistance and advice as needed. A rescue squad consisting of various plant personnel that have been trained in the use of special equipment, rescue techniques, spill containment and first aid to provide in-plant emergency staffing prior to the arrival of any other necessary emergency assistance.\n\nLeoni Township Fire Department and Rescue visits ADCO at least annually to review plant operations and to acquaint themselves with on-site emergency equipment. A local hospital is used for all first aid and medical emergency situations. Doctors from the hospital have toured the facility to become familiar with the operations.\n\nThe \u00bfworst-case release scenario\u00bf at the ADCO site\u00bfs stationary source was performed for the toluene 2,4-diisocyanate tank. The parameters used for the worst case release scenario were those defined and pre-set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the RMP COMP Ver. 1.07. The worst-case scenario involves the failure of a toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (T"

Should the TDI tank experience a complete failure, the TDI would be spilled into a 17.3 ft x 18.75 ft x 3 ft high dike. The capacity of the dike is 973 cubic feet while the entire contents of the tank is only 402 cubic feet. The dike is capable of containing the entire contents of the tank. Therefore, the toluene 2,4-diisocyanate would not reach any offsite endpoints or public receptors. As a result of these findings, ADCO meets the eligibility requirements for Program 1 status under the RMP Rule.\n\nProcedures are in place detailing the steps to be followed to prevent spills when unloading tanker trucks. However, potential for spills exists in essentially all plant areas from the over-filling of an AST, a break in a hose or line, or damage to drums during loading, unloading and storage. Outside solvent storage tanks and drums are diked to prevent loss of spilled materials from leaking lines or as a result of a total AST failure. Above ground tanks and lines are inspected monthly for damage and deterioration. There are no underground storage (UST) tanks or transfer lines on site. Plant personnel have been specifically trained to watch for spills and a spill response team has been trained to handle any minor emergencies that might arise from a spill.\n\nEmergency eyewash and safety showers have been installed near both tank farms for the protection of delivery drivers and plant employees in case of chemical contact.\n\nAll employees associated with the unloading, transfer and use of toluene 2,4-diisocyanate are trained in the proper procedures for its safe handling. When toluene 2,4-diisocyanate is being used in the facility, a chemical specific monitor (MDA isocyanate) is used to monitor the work area for leaks. All employees associated with the use of toluene 2,4-diisocyanate are given complete physicals on a bi-yearly basis.\n\nThe use of toluene 2,4-diisocyanate is controlled through a computer system"

All internal and external piping for this product is welded stainless steel to reduce the potential for leaks.\n\nADCO has had no accidents as defined in the RMP regulations in the past five years.\n\nEmergency evacuation plans designate two assembly points outside the plant. Each department is assigned to meet at one of the two assembly points. Evacuation maps are located throughout the facility showing emergency exit routes. Various staff members have been assigned responsibility for taking a headcount at the assembly point.\n\nThe plan also includes shutdown procedures for natural gas and electrical service into the plant. The site emergency coordinator will notify any needed off-site authorities and initiate any immediate required protective actions. Plans are also in place to coordinate activities with the Leoni Township Fire Department, City of Jackson HAZMAT Response Team, Jackson County Health Department, the Fire Marshall Division of the Michigan State Police and the Jackson County Board of Commissioners.\n\nA national weather alert radio system has been installed in the HS&E Office and the Mixing QC Lab to warn of severe weather and approaching tornadoes.\n\nADCO conducts monthly safety committee meetings designed to review problems, suggestions, and accidents to improve the safety of the facility.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on new processes, which contain hazardous chemicals. The process hazard analysis for the toluene 2,4-diisocyanate is reviewed each time the process is modified.\n\nADCO will continually strive to find new procedures and processes that will allow ADCO to improve employee health and safety as well as reduce potential environmental risk and community concern."
