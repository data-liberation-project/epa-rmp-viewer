      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nDescribe Policies  \n\nThe Calleguas Municipal Water District Board of Directors, management and all employees are committed to the safe operation of the Grimes Canyon Disinfection Facility. This commitment is reflected in the design, operation, maintenance, and procedures used to operate the facility. Calleguas has used chlorine gas safely since 1964 and aqueous ammonia safely since 1995.  The focus of Calleguas policies are to operate and maintain the disinfection system of the Grimes Canyon Disinfection Facility in such a way as to protect Calleguas employees, the surrounding communities and the environment from a chlorine or ammonia leak.  The policies incorporate the highest level of commitment to establishing safety by insuring multiple, redundant and parallel layers of safety.  The equipment is engineered for safety, procedures are developed for safe operation, safety is incorporated into training, employees are provided personal protective equipment, and emergency response procedures are coordinated with the local responding agencies. \n\nRegulated substances \n\nCalleguas Municipal Water District uses and stores only one federally regulated substance, Chlorine gas, requiring the development of this Risk Management Plan.  The maximum quantity capable of being stored on site is 40,000 lbs.  However, the maximum quantity normally stored on site seldom exceeds 30,000 lbs.   The chlorine gas is stored and used directly from Department of Transportation certified one (1)-ton cylinders.\n\nCalleguas Municipal Water District also uses and stores 19% Aqueous Ammonia (Ammonium Hydroxide).  Aqueous Ammonia is regulated by the State of California at quantities greater than 500 gallons and requires the development of a California Accidental Release Plan (California equivalent to the Federal Risk Management Plan).  The maximum quantity capable of being stored on site is 9,800 gallons.  However, the maximum quantity normally stored on site seldom exceeds 7,000 "

      "SummaryText": "gallons.   The Aqueous Ammonia is delivered to the site in certified chemical delivery trucks and is injected into the water directly from two 4900 gallon storage tanks.\n\nAdministrative control and mitigation measures\n\nCalleguas Staff, in conjunction with design engineers have developed a series of operational, and maintenance checklists and procedures.  These procedures insure the proper operation of the disinfection system.  In addition, these procedures insure that the equipment is calibrated, inspected and maintained at the top of safe operational efficiency.\n\nThe system is designed to prevent the release of chlorine and ammonia by including layers of safety.  The chlorine is stored in a concrete block building, located away from and remotely monitored by the 24-hour operations center.  The chlorine storage building has automated valves that will close if a chlorine leak is detected.  The building has a scrubber incorporated into the design of the building. The scrubber is designed to absorb and neutralize approximately 3000 lbs of chlorine gas (1.5 full cylinders).   Distribution of the chlorine gas is contained completely within the scrubber protected building.  Chlorine gas is mixed with water to form a 200 ppm solution that disinfects the water prior to distribution to the communities.  The disinfection solution is transported through buried double walled pipes designed to contain and report any leaks to the Operations Personnel.\n\nThe ammonia portion of the disinfection system includes the storage tanks for the aqueous ammonia and the pumps and piping used to transport and inject the ammonia solution into the chlorinated water.  The aqueous ammonia tanks are located close to the injection point.  The storage location provides secondary containment for the aqueous ammonia.  The piping connecting the stored aqueous ammonia to the injection point is double walled and drains into the secondary containment area.  This prevents a break in the delivery piping from "

      "SummaryText": "releasing the chemical into the environment.\n\nPrevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\nThe prevention program includes the full range of preparation and chemical specific measures available to prevent and prepare for an incident.  All information concerning chlorine and ammonia and the detailed engineering design information has been consolidated and is available.  An independent engineering consultant has completed the process hazard analysis.     \n\n5 year accident history\n\nSince 1964, Calleguas has used chlorine gas as a disinfectant for the water treatment process. In 1995, Calleguas began using aqueous ammonia to create the chloramines used in the distribution system.  Calleguas has never had an accident having offsite consequences.  This is a new facility and does not have a 5-year operating history.\n\nEmergency response program \n\nCalleguas has a very active emergency response program. We actively participate with the local Hazardous Materials Response Teams to prepare for emergencies at our facility and provide resources for emergency responses throughout the county.  We have had full-scale exercises at our facility to prepare and familiarize our employees with the facility.  \n\nChanges planned to improve safety\n\nAll changes recommended in the Process Hazard Analysis and Seismic review are relatively minor and will require only slight modifications to current operational, maintenance and safety procedures.  All of the changes detailed in the Process Hazard Analysis and all except one of the changes detailed in the Seismic Analysis were completed by December 2008.  The support column for the scrubber piping is the one item that will not be completed by December 2008.  This item will require seismic load analysis.  The work will be included in the Engineering Specification being developed for upgrades to the wellfield.\n"
