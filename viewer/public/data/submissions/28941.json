These products, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous under the RMP regulation.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the facility.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases. Employees at our site are members of the site's emergency response team, which is trained to respond to and control accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\n1.2  \tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and the redelivery of a variety of compressed gases and chemicals to the end user. The regulated substances are delivered to this facility in portable, DOT approved, shipping and storage containers. They are stored here until needed by the final user, at which time they are inspected prior to"

      "SummaryText": "shipment and loaded onto a transport vehicle and delivered to the final user location.  There is no chemical reaction involved, and neither is there any transfer of product from one container to another.  The regulated process is strictly the storage of the listed regulated substances in the containers in which they were received until they undergo a pre-shipment quality assurance inspection and are loaded onto a delivery vehicle to be transported to the end user.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at this facility which are stored as a compressed gas are listed below.  The maximum amount of these substances at this facility at the time of this submission is: \n\u00b7\t4,810 pounds of chlorine in 90 pound cylinders\n\u00b7\t15,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride in 600 pound cylinders and 150 pound cylinders\n\u00b7\t35,000  pounds of trichlorosilane in 550 pound drums\n\u00b7\t15,000  pounds of ammonia in 600 pound cylinders and 60 pound cylinders\n\n1.3  \tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nAir Products employs a number of administrative controls to limit the potential and magnitude of releases.  Foremost has been the decision to limit all activity for the three regulated substances to storage only.  There will be no transfer of any of the four regulated substances at the site.  Further, Air Products segregates toxic gases so as to reduce the potential of incompatible gases coming in contact with one another.  Segregation is accomplished through a combination of distance and/or masonry barriers.  Air Products consciously controls the on-site inventory of gases to limit the potential magnitude of a site release.  The facility has been designed with the storage area at ground level, to reduce the potential of damaging a cylinder through a fall.  Though these administrative controls will make the facility inherently more safe, the actual worst case and a"

Air Products provides manned coverage during normal business hours and manned response 24 hours a day.  The facility is equipped with a toxic gas sensing system, which would alert site personnel to releases.  Air Products' personnel are trained and capable of containing gas cylinders, up to 150 pounds in size, through the use of an Emergency Response Containment Vessel.  For larger containers Air Products personnel are capable of applying a valve sealing kit to control leaking relief valves.  Though these mitigation measures can help limit endpoint distances, the actual worst case and alternate case scenarios and resulting endpoint calculations, have not been altered as a result of their presence.\n\nThe toxic worst case, toxic alternate case, flammable worst case, and flammable alternate case information is listed in this executive summary and within the RMP submit software.  Other information on worst case and alternate scenarios for this site are included in the RMP Binder at the site.\n\n\nToxic Worst Case Scenario - Hydrogen Chloride\n\nThe toxic \"worst-case scenario\" (WCS), as defined by the RMP regulation, is the catastrophic failure of a six hundred pound Hydrogen Chloride cylinder.  The entire inventory of 600 pounds is assumed to be released and to vaporize.  The release was assumed to occur in an enclosure.  A release of this scenario would have off-site consequences\n\nAlternate Toxic Case Scenario - Hydrogen Chloride\n\nThe most likely alternate case for Hydrogen Chloride was determined to be the premature actuation of the relief device based on Air Products experience with this type of vessel.  Shearing off a cylinder valve may be a possibility but it is considered extremely remote due to the size of the largest cylinder and the handling procedures"

The modeling was done as a gaseous flow through the relief valve at the full flow rate the relief valve can pass until the contents of the vessel are released.   It was modeled as a continuous release at 268 lbs/min in an enclosure.  It has been Air Products experience that this type of release will be a quick puff type release, which quickly diminishes in flow as the container cools.  Followed by a slow lingering release until the leak can be stopped.\n\nA release of this scenario would have off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenario - Trichlorosilane\n\nThe flammable \"worst-case scenario\" (WCS), as defined by the RMP regulation, is the catastrophic failure of a 55-gallon Trichlorosilane drum.  The entire inventory of 550 pounds is assumed to be released into a diked area and vaporize. This scenario does not have off-site consequences.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario - Trichlorosilane\n\nThe most likely alternate case scenario for Chlorine was determined to be a leak through a puncture from a forklift.  The modeling was done as a liquid flow through the hole into a diked area.  It was modeled as a 60 minute release at 5150 lbs/min into a dike.  \nThis scenario does not have off-site consequences.\n\n1.4  \tThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply  with applicable state and industry codes.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps begin with the decision that all three regulated substances would be on-site for storage only.  Products will be segregated by compatible hazards (pyrophorics, toxic hydrides, oxidizers, corrosives, flammables) to reduce the possibility of releases.\n\n\n1.5  \tFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or a"

All facility employees have been trained to OSHA's HAZWOPER, First Responder Awareness Level in order to identify the need for an initiated response.  Retraining is conducted annually.\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Procedure Manual that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release. This information also contains the names and numbers of responding outside agencies.  Emergency actions and response for both flammable releases and toxic releases have been coordinated with the Fire Department.  Periodic drills are held in order to review these activities with the responsible responding units.\n\n1.7  \tPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
