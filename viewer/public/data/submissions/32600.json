Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe St. Charles Operations Cypress Polypropylene Plant of the Union Carbide Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible Care  requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe St. Charles Operations Cypress Polypropylene Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 500 million pounds of polypropylene resins. The material produced at this facility is sold to customers in the United States and abroad. Polypropylene is a type of plastic, which is produced in pellet form and then shipped to our customers, primarily in rail cars. The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Cypress Polypropylene Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals , the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical. The St. Charles Operations Cypress Polypropylene Plant has the following RMP regulated flammable substance: Propylene. N"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the RMP rule, OSHA's PSM standard, Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program and implementation of Union Carbides Operation Safety Program and Episodic Risk Management System. Key elements include:\nEquipment Design: Vessels and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical Hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up to date, and available for operating personnel.\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Process Hazard Analyses are conducted every three years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective actions needed to prevent their occurrence. \nEpisodic Risk Management: Periodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards which could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective actions needed to prevent their occurrence. These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques.\nOperational Safety Standards: Design requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in operation safety standards.\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up to date.\nOperator Training/Certification Program: The plant has a training and testing program which provides operators with the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.\nTechnical Staff Training and Support: Trained technical staff employees are available 24 hours a day to support operations.\nMaintenance Procedures: The plant has specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it oper"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the St. Charles Operations Cypress Polypropylene Plant that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage, or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe St. Charles Operations Cypress Polypropylene Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\nProper first aid and medical treatment for exposures\nEvacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\nNotification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\nPost-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and \nInspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility processes.\n\nThe St. Charles Operations Cypress Polypropylene Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies. The plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. Critiques are held for drills and actual events. In addition to the plant emergency squad, St. Charles parish DEP is notified immediately of the incident. The DEP determines the community impact and takes the appropriate action to protect the community. Additional resources are also available thru the mutual aid organizations, if needed.\n\nThe emergency response "

Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning to implement at the St. Charles Operations Cypress Polypropylene Plant to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\nComplete the Layers of Protection Analysis to ensure the necessary layers are in place.\nConduct periodic process hazard analyses for all processes and implement resulting recommendations for improvements to safety equipment and procedures.\nConduct New Leader Reviews so that newly assigned production leaders have all of the process safety and reactive chemicals information necessary for their new jobs.\nAll new projects are designed around principles of inherent safety so that process safety is integrated directly into the design.\nChanges to new or revised systems seek to minimize the quantities of hazardous materials."
