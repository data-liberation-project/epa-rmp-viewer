Box 1008, Hastings, NE 68902\r\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\r\nFacility Policy:\r\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of\r\nany accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations. In the event an\r\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department(s),\r\nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending\r\non the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to\r\npeople and the environment.\r\nFacility Information:\r\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 424510, \"Grain and Field Bean Merchant\r\nWholesalers\", however we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the\r\nreceiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. The\r\nNAICS code we feel most applicable for this activity is NAICS code \"424910 Farm Supplies\r\nMerchant Wholesalers\". Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product at this facility subject to EPA Risk\r\nManagement Planning, at this time.\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during\r\nthe spring and fall months. During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs. The\r\nmaximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank.\r\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and\r\nreloading of product for delivery. Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\r\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site therefore item number 1.11 is Zero. Our\r\nfacilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout the\r\nyear. Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation."

      "SummaryText": "Worst-case release scenario:\r\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia tank. The maximum quantity released based on 85 % tank capacity as limited\r\nby design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles based on\r\nEPA's RMP -Comp Program (Online Version), as well as possible public and environmental\r\nreceptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning\r\nCommittee) to assist them in their planning.\r\nAlternative release scenario:\r\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site. We\r\nbelieve the most likely release would be caused by damage to the liquid valve on a nurse tank due\r\nto a transportation incident. This could lead to the total loss of contents of the tank. The distance to\r\nthe endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is determined per instructions by EPA guidance.\r\nAccidental Release Program:\r\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American\r\nNational Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K61.1-1999 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage\r\nand Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\r\n(OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". We conduct\r\nannual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous\r\nAmmonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves,\r\nBreakaway couplers at risers, Emergency shut-off valves, Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or\r\nother vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.
