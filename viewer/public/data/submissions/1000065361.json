This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.  \n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThis facility began operation in 1998.  Since that time, we have not had a release of anhydrous ammonia, hydrochloric acid or ammonium hydroxide that resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact from our facility.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\n\n\nOur employees are trained and equipped to respond and neutralize releases of hazardous materials. Our employees regularly undergo extensive training in emergency response actions and methods.  Our facilities regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, gain familiarity with our operations, and participate in joint emergency drills.  This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly.  \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews and process hazard analyses.  We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.
