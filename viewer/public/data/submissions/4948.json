Foods, we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  O. K. Foods strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Heavener Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of poultry products.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nO.K. Foods has two independent systems at this site.  The largest system contains 12,700 pounds of ammonia.  The maximum total amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 21,400 pounds.  We have the capacity for 35,666 pounds but do not run above 60% of total capacity.\n\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEAS"

      "SummaryText": "E SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of our largest receiver.  O. K. Foods policy restricts the maximum capacity of this 18,445 pound tank to 60% of capacity.  The greatest amount stored in that tank is 11,158 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source.  \nDistance to endpoint: 1.1 miles \n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure release valve.  The emergency valves shut-down release would engage and stop the flow or an alarm would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 60 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 1,832 pounds of ammonia.  \nDistance to endpoint:  0.09 miles (153 yards)\n\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nTo date, this O. K. Foods facility has had no releases.\n\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Brad Shelton, Slaughter Plant Manager.  Mr. Shelton will administrate in conjunction with the O. K. Foods management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Le Flore County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Heavener Fire Department and HAZMAT team.\n\n\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThe O. K. Foods facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are observed by senior maintenance staff and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.\n\n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE P"

We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\nCurrently, O. K. Foods trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed and updated annually.  Our program is improved continuously through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available."
