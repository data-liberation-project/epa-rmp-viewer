      "SummaryText": "United States Cold Storage Arlington is a public refrigerated warehouse that stores raw or processed food items (such as those found in your local supermarkets or restaurants) prior to distribution.  Temperatures of the different product storage areas can range from -10?F to +40?F.  Our refrigeration process uses a chemical known as anhydrous ammonia contained within a closed-loop system.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia has been used safely in commercial refrigeration applications since the early 1900\u0092s.  It has an excellent warning property, which is a distinct and irritating odor which can be detected at concentrations as low as 5 PPM (parts per million) in air.  Most people are familiar with the smell as it is a common ingredient in many household cleaning products.\n\nThe total refrigerant charge at USCS Arlington is approximately 12,459 lbs.  Throughout the process, most of the ammonia resides within pressure-rated vessels inside of a specially constructed machinery room.  During the cooling/freezing process, liquid ammonia is pumped from a vessel through piping to evaporator units in each area that needs cooling such as the storage rooms or docks.  As that ammonia passes through the evaporator, it pulls heat from the surrounding area and changes from a liquid into a vapor within the pipes.  That vapor is sent to a condenser unit on the roof, where the outside of the coils is cooled by air or water, getting rid of the excess/unwanted heat, and changing back from a vapor to a liquid before flowing back to the vessel to close the loop and start the process over. \n\nAll refrigeration equipment has been designed, manufactured, and installed in accordance with strict regulations such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, applicable Building, Fire, and Mechanical codes, as well as industry specific standards published by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration.  \n\nThis equipment is maintained according to the preventative maintenance schedules laid out in the m"

      "SummaryText": "ost current edition of ANSI/IIAR6 Standard for Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.  An electronic control system monitors conditions 24-7 and will automatically notify maintenance staff of any abnormal operating conditions.\n\nIn addition, there are dozens of safety measures in place.  A few examples include:\n\n\u0095\tAmmonia detectors in the engine room, product storage areas, and docks\n\u0095\tAutomatic system shutdowns\n\u0095\tPressure Safety Relief Valves on critical equipment\n\u0095\tManual emergency-stops\n\u0095\tEtc.\n\nOur refrigeration systems are operated by a staff of specially trained maintenance personnel, many of whom are members of IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) and/or RETA (Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association).  \n\nUSCS has owned/operated the Arlington location since 1984. The facility has not had a release resulting in employee injuries or off-site impacts in the past 5 years.\nUSCS Arlington maintains emergency response and emergency action plans which are reviewed and updated annually.  These programs are based on the OSHA requirements found in 29 CFR 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, in addition to all applicable EPA and other local/state requirements.\n\nEach USCS location has first responders trained in emergency response (24-hr hazmat technician level specializing in ammonia releases).  These employees receive a minimum of four hours of refresher training annually.  Each site conducts simulated emergency response drills quarterly and joint training exercises with local fire departments/hazmat teams/emergency planning committees whenever possible.\n\nAlthough no specific upgrades are planned at this time, USCS is continuously evaluating new mitigation and control technologies."
