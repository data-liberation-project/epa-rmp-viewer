Among the processes required for proper treatment of potable water is the chlorination process.  The chlorination process adds chlorine gas to process water to reduce bacteria. Chlorine is received in one-ton containers. The chlorination process has a separate area for storage and process activities.  The process has been designed in accordance with all local, state, and federal codes and requirements. The process has gas detection systems that alarm should the concentration of chlorine reach 1.0 parts per million. The chlorination process is maintained and operated by personnel certified by the State of Illinois as Water Treatment Plant Operators.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility continues to maintain its compliance program to meet the requirements of \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\" for the chlorination process.  Compliance with this regulation, and EPA's \"Risk Management Program Rule\" helps to prevent the release of chlorine from this process.  Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of chlorine in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release. The facility has recently installed a chlorine scrubber system in the chlorine feed room to capture and neutralize any chlorine leaks that may occur within that room. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no incidents involving the chlorination process resulting in injury to personnel during the previous five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: The \"City of Deca"
