The Lake Washington Water Production Facility is made up of the John A. Buckley Surface Water Treatment Plant and the Joe Mullins Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment Plant.\n\n1.1    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\n\n    The LWWPF accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).\n    \n1.1.1.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (a)(1)\n\nThe City has a management system in place whish oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with the other City policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n\n1.1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (a)(2)\n\nThe City maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, the elements needed to implement the RMP program, and the like elements in place in the plants? OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained in the City?s Document Control System (DCS).\n\n1.2    THE CITY OF MELBOURNE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLING AT THE MELBOURNE, FLORIDA SITE (B)\n\nThe City employs 46 full-time employees at the facility and in field operations.  Chlorine is used as part of the water production process.\n\n1.2.1    SITE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe chlorine facilities are housed in a totally enclosed temperature controlled building just south of the Operations Building located at the John A. Buckley Surface Water Treatment Plant.  Both the bulk storage area and control room are within the same building.  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the container "

This PSM program has been in place and effectively used since 1999.  It is part of the standard operating procedure for the facility.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  These programs are coordinated with the City?s Fire Department and Brevard County?s HazMat Team.\n\n1.4.1    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d)(1)\n\nFacility-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.\n\n1.4.2    CHLORINE-SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM (d)(2)\n\n1.4.2.1.Chlorine-Specific Policies and Procedures\n\nChlorine-specific prevention features at the facility include policies and procedures for the operation of the chlorine system.\n\n1.4.2.2.Facility Design\n\nThe chlorine storage and feed facilities are within an enclosed building.  The storage and control areas are in separate rooms, with a window providing a clear view of the chlorine containers and gas withdrawal system.  Both rooms are subject to a forced-air draft ventilation and exhaust system that maintains"

Otherwise, the building interior is typically held at ambient temperature levels.\n\nIn addition, several safety features were incorporated into the facility design.  An automatic container shut-off system was provided.  On detection of a chlorine leak, a nitrogen gas powered valve system isolates all containers. The ventilation system is interlocked with the alarm system such that it shuts off upon leak detection.  There is also a chlorine gas scrubber system that starts upon leak detection.  This system evacuates the chlorine gas from the building interior and uses sodium hydroxide to render the gas inert prior to its release to the atmosphere.  Finally, the materials of construction used were based on recommendations of the Chlorine Institute standards and guidelines.\n\n1.4.2.3.Equipment Design\n\n            There are two pipe systems, high pressure and vacuum.\n\n1.5    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no incidents at the Lake Washington Water Production Facility.\n\n1.6    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\n\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the City?s Emergency Response Plan (ERP).\n\nThe ERP is coordinated with the Melbourne Fire Department, who in turn coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Brevard County HazMat Team.\n\n1.6.1.    PERSONNEL (f)(1)\n\nCity employees make up the operations team, while Brevard County employees make up the emergency response team.\n\n1.7    CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (G)\n\nThe City continually reviews and updates safety improvements for all of its operations."
