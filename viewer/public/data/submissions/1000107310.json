Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during an oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.

It is immediately surrounded by other cooling facilities and local farms. The overall site occupies 10 acres; with a total building space of 44,880 square feet which includes 39,800 square feet dedicated to cold storage & 2,200 square feet for pressure pre-cooling. This facility is designed for seasonal fresh produce vacuum cooling, pressure pre-cooling, short-term temperature-controlled storage and shipping, and utilizes a portable high-side compressing / condensing trailer to support the Cooler.  Several independent, portable closed-loop vacuum cooling plants are also utilized, which is a configuration common to the industry. The primary commodities handled include leafy greens. The stationary portions of the facility were new in late October of 2018; the facility is permitted by the City of Yuma and was constructed according to the codes & standards in effect at that time.  Fire and life safety systems are engineered directly into the Plant as part of its design and code compliance requirements. Land, buildings, and stationary equipment are owned by WPS. Cool Fresh LLC is the operating entity owned WPS 50% and Gary Anthony 50%.  Portable equipment is either owned in partnerships and leased to Cool Fresh; or leased from WPS.

An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department is being performed on an ongoing basis.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submittal of appropriate reports, and annual invitations for the Yuma Fire Department to conduct periodic facility review & training.

CF is an established fresh produce cooling facility in Yuma, AZ which employs multiple closed-loop ammonia processes, each of which are under the 10K lbs.

This Risk Management Plan voluntarily considers its ammonia operations as one closed-loop process.\n\n1\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Cool Fresh LLC (CF) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies.  The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs, which includes both the EPA Risk Management Program and OSHA\u2019s Process Safety Management Programs.  CF has developed their RMP / PSM Manual to document policies addressing the implementation of the regulations governing these programs.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others.  The RMP sections pertain to management systems, accident history and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis-OCA) Report.  Nuances between the RMP & PSM Programs have been integrated according to Guidance documents published by USEPA.  \n\nThe PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances and forms the Program Level 3 Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.
