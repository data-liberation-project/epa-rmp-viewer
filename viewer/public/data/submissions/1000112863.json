This \"syngas\" contains primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and small amounts of other flammable and inert gases. The syngas from the  units is further refined on-site into final products of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Some of the syngas produced by the reformer units is also used indirectly as a raw material in a formaldehyde production process. Anhydrous ammonia is used to control the air emissions from one of the reformer units.  The ammonia is injected into the flue gas and passed over a catalyst to reduce potential air pollutants into harmless substances such as nitrogen and water vapor.\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n\n1. Methane:  Supplied by a local natural gas utility, is reacted in steam-methane reformer units to produce \"syngas\", which is a flammable gas mixture containing hydrogen, methane and other non-regulated substances. \n\n2. Hydrogen:  Produced on site and supplied to local customer via pipeline.\n\n3. Formaldehyde:  Stored in our tank farm, and distributed to a nearby customer via  pipeline.  \n\n4. Anhydrous ammonia:  Used to control the air emissions from one of the reformer units.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical r"

This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity. \n- Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive design safety and management of change programs that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review. \n\nLinde has an employee participation program that promotes involvement in the process safety program and helps ensure understanding of facility-specific elements of the safety program.\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered processes at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\nAll of the RMP covered processes have process monitoring by manned con"

There are alarms, procedures and interlocks in place to aid in preventing releases.  The Geismar facility has in place both manual and automated shutdowns of the processes.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Geismar, SMR facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical processes over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\nThe five year accident history includes one incident that met the criteria of process safety incidents to be included in the submittal.  The incident occurred on June 4, 2023 in the Formaldehyde Process. The duration of the incident was approximately five (5) minutes and the initiating event was categorized as Human Error. As a result of the incident there was one injury and property damage estimated at $3M US.  Corrective actions included equipment upgrades, procedure and training revisions.  See Section 6 \u0096 Accident History for additional information.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Geismar location employees respond to a release in a defensive manner.  A third-party contractor is on a retainer to respond to facility emergencies involving fire, explosions or releases. \n\nThe plan is communicated and coordinated with community response plans.  All training, drills, and plan reviews are documented.  Visitors and contractors receive an orientation covering assembly and evacuation, security, hazardous work permitting and on-site chemicals.  All facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at lease annually.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nLinde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \""
