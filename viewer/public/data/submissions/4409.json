Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Water Treatment Plant #1 are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental\nsafety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is potable water treatment.  We have 1 regulated substance present\nat our facility.  This substance is chlorine.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant.\n\n\n3.   The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  The following\nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 (chlorine toxic substance) involves a\ncatastrophic release from our chlorine storage process.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of chlorine is\nreleased.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 5.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from our chlorine injection\nprocess.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of chlorine.  Toxic gas is assumed to be\nreleased from a"

A passive mitigation control such as an enclosure is taken into account to\ncalculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic\nendpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine is 0.30 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.   The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific\nPrevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\nrequirements.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with TNRCC 290.101\nRules & Regulations for Public Water Systems.    The following sections briefly describe the\nelements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWater Treatment Plant #1 maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Water Treatment\nPlant #1 maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of\noperation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown,\nemergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is\nregularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nWater Treatment Plant #1 has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated\nwith these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as\nneeded.\n\nMaintenance\nWater Treatment Plant #1 carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process\nequipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; one ton cylinders, p"

Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nWater Treatment Plant #1 conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions\nset out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was\nconducted on 02/24/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWater Treatment Plant #1 promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could\nreasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are\nundertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to\nprevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n5.   Five-year Accident History\nWater Treatment Plant #1 has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the\nlast 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n\n6.   Emergency Response Plan\nWater Treatment Plant #1 follows a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental\nreleases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and\nserviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place\nwithin our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.   Planned Changes "
