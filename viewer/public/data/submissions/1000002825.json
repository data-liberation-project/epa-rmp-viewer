      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE\nPROGRAM\n\nThe Gilliland gas plant has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety.  This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Gilliland gas plant, located in rural Knox County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to\nrecover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane) from field gas.  The gas plant also\nrecovers the regulated flammables, pentane and ethane.  There are no threshold quantities of\ntoxic substances present.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Gilliland gas\nplant.  Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection\nAgency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM)\nstandard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the\nmanagement system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Gilliland gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety\nmanagement and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways t"

In\naddition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and\nemployee safety issues.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Gilliland gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\ndesign basis/configuration information.  Specific departments are assigned responsibility for\nmaintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The reference documents and their location is\nreadily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any\nnecessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is\nsupplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas\nplant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,\nlevel, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and\nconstruction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information provides a\nbasis for establishing inspect"

These\nprocedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent\ntraining of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as\ncurrent and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary\nto reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are\nreadily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to\nsafely perform their job task.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Gilliland gas plant has\nimplemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a\nprocess.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already\nfamiliar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is\npaired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators\ndemonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the\nduties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all\noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their\nskills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted\nat least every three years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means\nused to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Gilliland gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased\nmaintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview,\n(2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and\n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Gilliland gas plant\nevaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas\nplant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are\nfulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Gilliland gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that\nrequires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that\nsafety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior\nto placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure\nconstruction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are\noperationally ready.

Within this program, each process is\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\nmanage these hazards.\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The\nanalyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience\nas well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well\nas accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional\nprevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. \nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk\nranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team\nfindings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented\nand retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and\nrevalidates the hazard analysis results.
