The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nLambent Technologies Corporation (LTC) operates its facilities in the safest possible manner and believes in being a responsible corporate citizen and maintaining open, constructive dialogue with our neighbors. These principles are an integral part of our corporate Policy.  We believe that sharing this information with our neighbors will help the community better understand how safely LTC operates.\n\nLTC has the following Corporate Guidelines related to environmental, health and safety:\n\n? Create a workplace free from occupational injuries and illnesses\nLTC is committed to achieving safety excellence and promoting employee health and wellness. We manage our businesses with a belief that all accidents are preventable through proper training, work practices and vigilant attention. Accident prevention is a responsibility recognized and shared by all employees and all levels of management. \n\n? Prevent environmental incidents\nSpills and accidental releases to the environment are unacceptable. Through careful planning and regular review of our facilities and operations, we seek to identify risks and proactively eliminate them.\n\n? Ensure sustainable compliance, and go beyond compliance when necessary to protect human health and the environment\nLTC operations encompass a wide range of activities that are subject to many national, state and local regulations and standards. The company has also established its own policies that support and, in some cases, are more stringent than the regulations. To achieve sustainable compliance, we continuously monitor our operations and the changing legal requirements and address any situations that may compromise our ability to comply. We also establish timely training and effective management systems to ensure that Petroferm management and employees understand and continuously comply with applicable regulations and policies.\n\n\n?

      "SummaryText": "of our total productivity improvement process\nLTC routinely evaluates methods to prevent pollution, improve resource utilization effectiveness, and generate less waste material. We also strive to reuse or reclaim materials to the greatest extent economically feasible, to minimize the amount of waste requiring disposal. While this prevention approach is preferable, some amount of after-the-fact treatment of wastes is required in our manufacturing processes. We are committed to operating waste management and pollution control equipment to minimize environmental impacts.\n\nThe LTC Gurnee Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\nThe LTC Gurnee Site uses two (2) RMP regulated chemicals: ethylene oxide and propylene oxide as raw materials.  These chemicals are used to manufacture surfactants.  The end products of the Gurnee site using the RMP chemicals as raw materials are used for personal care, food additives and automotive coatings.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Process Safety\nCode.\n\nCapital projects that have been approved by management and have been installed at the Gurnee site include a distributed control system for improved process control and reduced risk of an accidental release, an air control device called a scrubber, an improved water system for safety showers and eye wash stations, the installation of valves to reduce fugitive emissions and a leak detection program to detect fugitive emissions.\n\n4. Five-year accident History\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release over the past five years\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community pla"

Employees are trained how to identify an emergency and how to adequately respond. There is an alert system at the site that is used to notify all employees of an emergency and the need to take action. There are layers of protection and redundant process control systems that will prevent or reduce the severity of a release.\n\nThe LEPC Coordinator for the county has been advised that the site is covered by the RMP regulations and has taken a tour of the facility.\n\n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nProcesses are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee safety programs which include monthly training sessions, observation and suggestion programs, incident investigation and corrective action programs, audits and inspection programs and preventative maintenance programs and schedules."
