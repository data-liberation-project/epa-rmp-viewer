This determination is based upon federal and state process safety management (PSM) regulations and Santee Cooper standards.  This process (receipt, storage, and conveyance) is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three program levels (1,2, & 3) of requirements.  Program Level 1 is applicable to a process for which it can be demonstrated that no public receptors (e.g., residence, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals) would be affected by a worst-case release.  A covered process is subject to Program 2 requirements if it does not meet the eligibility requirements of either Program 1 or 3.  Therefore, Santee Cooper's worst-case scenario identifies public receptors that would be affected.  40 CFR Part 68 identifies that the processes at the Santee Cooper WGS facility are subject to Program 3 requirements.  The Santee Cooper Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with the Level 3 RMP Program requirements for this facility under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nCovered Process and Description of Ammonia Storage and Handling\n\nThe only RMP-listed toxic chemical and covered process that is present at the Winyah Generating Station is anhydrous ammonia and the process consists of the following areas:\n\n\n\n&#9658;    Ammonia Unloading - Offload liquid ammonia from truck trailer into eight ammonia tanks \n\n&#9658;    Ammonia Storage - Store liquid ammonia in eight ammonia storage tanks\n\n&#9658;    Ammonia Feed to Selective Catalytic Recovery (SCR) unit - deliver liquid ammonia from ammonia tanks to SCR for reaction with NOx.\n\n\n\nThe location of the ammonia storage tanks was determined to be 33.32617?

This location was used in the MARPLOT software as the center point for the release radius.\n\n\n\nModeling Software and Selection\n\nFor the 2021 RMP update, ALOHA 5.4.7 and MARPLOT 5.1.1 were used. A number of release models were evaluated in order to identity a model that would provide a reasonable evaluation of the release scenario and properties of anhydrous ammonia in the atmosphere for the conditions at WGS. The following models were evaluated:\n\n\n\nDEGADIS - The Dense Gas Dispersion Model (DEGADIS) is a mathematical dispersion model that can be used to model the transport of toxic chemical releases into the atmosphere. Its range of applicability includes continuous, instantaneous, finite duration, and time- variant releases; negatively-buoyant and neutrally-buoyant releases; ground-level, low-momentum area releases; ground-level or elevated upwardly-directed stack releases of gases or aerosols. \n\n\n\nSLAB - The SLAB model is capable of simulating a dense gas release from a ground level evaporating pool, an elevated horizontal jet, a stack or elevated vertical jet, or an instantaneous volume source. Sources may be part vapor and part liquid droplets; except the evaporating pool source which is assumed to be all vapors. \n\n\n\nAFTOX - The Air Force Toxic Chemical Dispersion (AFTOX) model is a Gaussian dispersion model that is used to calculate toxic corridors in case of accidental releases. It is limited to non-dense gases. It can directly calculate the evaporation rate from liquid spills. AFTOX treats instantaneous or continuous releases from any elevation and can calculate the rise of buoyant plumes. It is intended to be consistent with the ADAM model for passive (neutrally buoyant) gas releases. \n\n\n\nALOHA - The Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) system was developed jointly by NOAA and EPA. ALOHA can model toxic gas clouds,"

      "SummaryText": " flammable gas clouds, BLEVEs (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosions), jet fires, pool fires, and vapor cloud explosions. \n\n\n\nThe conditions of the ammonia release result in a two-phase release - liquid and vapor. Therefore, the release considered a dense gas release. AFTOX is not suitable for a dense gas release; therefore, DEGADIS and SLAB were evaluated. Technical problems were encountered with both models. The DEGADIS model was unable to represent the two-phase release. The SLAB model did not have the capability to model the tank release without representing it as a vertical jet, which resulted in an unrealistic scenario. \n\n\n\nALOHA version 5.4.7 was used to model the release. The Heavy Gas dispersion calculations used in ALOHA are based on the DEGADIS model. Some simplifications were introduced into ALOHA-DEGADIS, making it different from the DEGADIS model. ALOHA-DEGADIS is limited to releases at ground level and does not account for the initial momentum from a jet release. Some of the numerical methods used in ALOHA-DEGADIS have been simplified compared to those used in DEGADIS. \n\n\n\nSelection of the Worst-Case Scenario \n\nEach of the ammonia storage vessels at the Winyah Generating Station has a capacity of 30,000 gallons. The tanks are administratively controlled via level monitoring and high level alarms to contain a maximum of 82% of the total tank capacity. Therefore, 82% of the total capacity of the tank was considered for the worst-case release scenario (i.e., 24,600 gallons). \n\n\n\nThe pounds of ammonia released were calculated using the ammonia storage tank volume and density at storage conditions. Passive mitigation (containment) was not considered in the release scenario since the release was two-phase and was treated as a gaseous release that would not form a pool or be mitigated by an enclosure. \n\n\n\nSince the release is represented as an unmitigated toxic gas, the average release rate was calculated from Equation 3-1 in the OCA Guidance. \n\n\n\nIn acc"
