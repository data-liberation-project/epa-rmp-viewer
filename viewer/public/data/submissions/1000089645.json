When ammonia is dissolved in water the theoretical reaction is as follows:\n\n\n\nNH3 + H2O &#8594; NH4OH\n\n\n\nHowever, it is known that dissociation takes place:\n\n\n\nNH4OH &#8594; NH4+ + OH\n\n\n\nAmmonia is considered a weak base and ionizes in water much less completely than a strong base such as sodium hydroxide. A molar solution of ammonia has a hydroxyl ion concentration of about 2 percent of that in a molar sodium hydroxide solution. \n\n\n\nHydroxyl ion (and hydrogen ion) concentration is measured by pH. The pH scale is a series of numbers (0-14) expressing the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution, as compared to some reference solution.
