      "SummaryText": "The City of Erie Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is committed to minimizing the risk to employees and to the public of injury or death resulting from an accidental release of chlorine. Chlorine is the only regulated substance at the WWTP and is used fro the disinfection of the City's effluent stream prior to discharge. There are never more then 10 - one ton cylinders on site at any time. There is only 1 - one ton cylinder online at any given time. The most significant change in the past five is the discontinuing of the use of 90 ton rail cars to supply chlorine. This was duly noted when the Plant was audited and inspected by the EPA on May 8, 2003. it was noted during that inspection and inspection and audit that the City of Erie Wastwater Treatment Plant's plan meets the minimal requireemnts of a Program 2 RMP process. During the past five years there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the Wastwater Treatment Plant."
