The previous filing in 2004 was requested by the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services during a plant expansion. Since 2004 there has only been minor changes to the system and increased inventory of NH3. These changes included adding 1 compressor and 1 Hydro-cooler.\nThis RMP resubmission includes; Executive Summary, Registration, Offsite Consequence Analysis, 5 year Accident History, Prevention Program 3, Emergency Response Program, Certification and Updates. \nA current detailed copy of RMP, and Prevention Program including PHA materials can be reviewed at the facility by contacting Lawrence Sambado. \nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). This facility will not make specific RMP or OCA information available to the public until a final ruling is made. Any accidental or authorized release of information in section 2-5 by government officials violates Federal Law.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at A Sambado & Son, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass growing, packing, processing, storage and shipping of fresh produce.  We have 1 regulated substance above federal thresholds present at our facility.  The substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) NH3.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as refrigerant in a closed loop floode"

The EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used as a reference.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest vessel.  In this scenario Ammonia (anhydrous) is released from the High Pressure receiver #4.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  There are no mitigation measures since this HPR is outside.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a gas release typical of a compressor shaft seal failure.  The scenario involves a gas release from a \u00bc\u00bf diameter hole with a pressure of 181 PSIG/95\u00b0F. The release rate is 12 pounds/min. inside an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles which is reported as <.1 miles.\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in"
