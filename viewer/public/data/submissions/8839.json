THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT,AND EMPLOYEES OF FARMERS UNION COOP OIL ASSN ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZER FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECIEVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. \n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 490,000 POUNDS IN OUR 30,000 AND 12,000 STORAGE TANKS AND NURSE TANKS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.12 MILES.\n\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA  IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT:\n     HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY; NOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS:\n\nA. A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nB. PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n\nC.  COORDINATED WITH LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\n     SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY.  PERIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS.  THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA  SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME."
