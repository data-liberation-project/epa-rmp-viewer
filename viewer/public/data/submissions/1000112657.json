This plan will be reviewed annually, audited every\t\t\t\t\t\nthree years, and updated as necessary by Darigold.\t\t\t\t\t\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating the refrigeration system\t\t\t\t\t\nunderstands the refrigeration process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. Only\t\t\t\t\t\nqualified maintenance personnel operate the refrigeration system.\t\t\t\t\t\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\t\t\t\t\t\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the Darigold facility in the past five years.\t\t\t\t\t\n1.5 Emergency Planning and Response\t\t\t\t\t\nDarigold has a written emergency action plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place\t\t\t\t\t\nto protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It complies with the\t\t\t\t\t\nprovisions of WAC 296-24-567. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency\t\t\t\t\t\nplanning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to\t\t\t\t\t\nhave a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been provided to\t\t\t\t\t\nand reviewed with Sunnyside Fire and Rescue.\t\t\t\t\t\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most\t\t\t\t\t\nlikely to occur at Darigold and to establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and\t\t\t\t\t\nhealth during an emergency. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep\t\t\t\t\t\nprocessing malfunctions from becoming ammonia-release emergencies. If an emergency does\t\t\t\t\t\noccur, Darigold has trained personnel to immediately notify the Sunnyside Fire Department and take\t\t\t\t\t\nactions to investigate or repair an incidental leak. Automatic alarms, shutdown systems, and controls have\t\t\t\t\t\nbeen designed to minimize the potential for an uncontrolled release.\t\t\t\t\t\nAll Darigold personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock\t\t\t\t\t\nemergency drills are held"

      "SummaryText": "1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\t\t\t\t\t\nSafety at Darigold is inherent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design\t\t\t\t\t\nof the facility incorporates multiple safety devices, safe handling procedures, maintaining mechanical\t\t\t\t\t\nintegrity and appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects of safety at our facility.\t\t\t\t\t\nDarigold has implemented a process safety management (PSM) program that complies with the\t\t\t\t\t\nregulations stipulated by Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) \u00a71910.119, which requires Darigold to\t\t\t\t\t\nimplement integrated safeguards to prevent an ammonia release. A crucial component of this plan is\t\t\t\t\t\nthe emergency action plan, developed in compliance with the emergency planning provisions of\t\t\t\t\t\nOAR Chapter 437 Division 002. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and\t\t\t\t\t\ncoordination with outside parties to enable coordinated action to effectively deal with unplanned\t\t\t\t\t\nevents.\t\t\t\t\t\n1.2 Facility Description and Substances Handled\t\t\t\t\t\nDarigold operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process to refrigerate food products such as cheese and milk powder. \t\t\t\t\t\n Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to\t\t\t\t\t\npreserve the integrity of foods, and Darigold uses ammonia as the refrigerant. Access to the facility is\t\t\t\t\t\nlimited to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\t\t\t\t\t\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\t\t\t\t\t\nDarigold's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and\t\t\t\t\t\nmaintenance of the refrigeration equipment. Plan elements essential to the safe operation of the\t\t\t\t\t\nrefrigeration system includes employee participation, process safety information, process hazard\t\t\t\t\t\nanalysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review,\t\t\t\t\t\nmechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident"
