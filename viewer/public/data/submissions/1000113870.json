Our program consists of procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.  \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes participation in periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and other industry representatives.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  The plant also conducts periodic emergency drills.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nWe strive to continuously improve the safety of our plant TDI process through periodic safety reviews and a program of soliciting safety suggestions from employees.

The process for producing polyurethane foam requires the use of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI).  TDI is listed in the Clean Air Act 112 (r) list of regulated substances.  Consequently, FXI is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR).  The same properties that give TDI commercial value are the characteristics that make it a hazardous material.  Prior to RMPR, FXI recognized the chemical and physical hazards involved with TDI and has observed safety precautions in its handling.  These precautions have been implemented to help limit exposure to the public, environment and our employees.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  \n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees, the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Effective implementation and monitoring of our accidental release prevention program helps us facilitate our Management System in the interest of reducing the possibility of accidental releases and proper mitigation in the event of an accidental release.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities, and the automotive industry.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received primarily by rail car and is stored in indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in rail cars and in storage tanks at our plant is about 940,000 pounds.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam is conveyed to cutting stations, where it is cut to the specifications provided by our customers.\n\nTDI is the"
