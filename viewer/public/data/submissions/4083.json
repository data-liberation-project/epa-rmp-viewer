      "SummaryText": "Williamsport Sanitary Authority\nCentral Plant\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis executive summary is intended to present a basic description of the Williamsport Sanitary Authority's (WSA) Risk Management Program (RMP).  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (FR 61 [120], p31668) issued on June 20, 1996, require facilities that have a regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to develop and implement a formal Risk Management Program.  \n\nThe management of the WSA is committed to safe handling and use of regulated hazardous substances.  Benefits of the RMP include an understanding of the hazards of regulated substances by the employees, improved process control, maintenance and equipment availability, emergency preparedness, and reduced costs related to accidents, injuries, and insurance.  The RMP provides for procedures necessary for safe plant operations.   \n\nIn 1953, the WSA the Central Wastewater Treatment Plant was constructed to provide primary treatment.  The plant was updated to secondary treatment in 1974.  The WSA Central Plant is rated at 10.5 million gallons per day with a design population of 60,000 persons and treats wastewater from the portions of Williamsport and Loyalsock Township east of Lycoming Creek and the Borough of South Williamsport.  Industrial wastewaters are controlled by the WSA's EPA-approved pretreatment program which protects the collection and treatment systems from upsets, interference, dangerous materials, and contamination of the final digested solids.  The WSA is proud of its compliance record in meeting state and federal discharge standards and its role in helping to maintain the quality of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River.  A primary objective of the WSA Central Plant is to maintain public health by providing disinfection of the effluent prior to discharge into the West Branch of the Susquehanna River.  Because more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine is stored for this purpo"

      "SummaryText": "se, the WSA Central Plant is subject to the RMP regulations.  Chlorine is stored in pressurized one ton containers.  The WSA Central Plant maintains a maximum inventory of 12,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\nThe RMP regulations require each site to conduct an offsite consequence analysis which provides information to the government and the public about the potential consequences of an accidental chemical release at the facility.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  The worst-case scenario is defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance in 10 minutes from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  For offsite consequence analysis, the WSA used the American Water Works Association Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants which uses the ALOHA Model.  The WSA used the worst-case scenario of a catastrophic failure due to corrosion, impact, or construction defects of a one ton container.  In this scenario, 2,000 pounds of chlorine is released in 10 minutes.  The distance to end-point is 2.6 miles.  The alternative scenario, which is more likely than the worst-case scenario, is a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through a 5/16 inch diameter valve opening.  In this scenario, 317 pounds of chlorine is released, and the distance to end-point is 0.48 miles.  Both the worst-case and alternative scenarios involve offsite impact.  Estimates of population affected are made based on 1990 census data.\n\nWSA employees are trained in the proper handling of the chlorine containers and also in the repair of incidental leaks.  The WSA Central Plant is equipped with chlorine gas monitors which would immediately notify employees of an incident so they can take action to prevent a worst-case scenario from occurring.  The most likely time for an accident to occ"

      "SummaryText": "ur is during delivery or during the change to a new container.  For this reason, deliveries and changing of containers are only performed on first shift weekdays, and when at least two employees are present using defined procedures.  Each container is inspected prior to unloading. \n\nEach WSA employee working with the chlorine process receives classroom and hands-on training in the safe handling of chlorine, preventative maintenance, and incidental repair of leaks.  Each employee is also trained in the procedures to be taken in the event of an accidental release.  The WSA response program is coordinated with the Lycoming County Emergency Planning Committee.  Training drills have been coordinated with the Lycoming County Emergency Planning Committee, local fire departments, and the county's hazmat response team.  Public notification of an accidental release would be through the civil defense siren, emergency broadcasting system and telephone notification of immediate neighbors by the WSA.  The WSA will use a contracted emergency response team whose response time is approximately thirty minutes to handle the repair and cleanup of any accident.  There have been no accidental releases at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe WSA management is committed to continued review and implementation of the RMP.  The RMP regulation has helped to enhance our existing safety programs.  It also ensures that in the unlikely event of an accidental release, employees and local area emergency responders are fully trained and ready to engage specific plans to remediate the situation quickly.  The added protection of the RMP will ensure the safety of our personnel, the environment and the community."
