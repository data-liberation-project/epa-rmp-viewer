      "SummaryText": "Franzen Reservoir is the primary water storage facility for the City of Salem.  The facility uses chlorine gas to disinfect treated water that has been stored in the reservoir before sending the water into the distribution system.  The purpose of disinfection is to destroy or remove harmful or objectionable organisms from the water.  Disinfection destroys disease producing organisms.  Chlorine gas is used at the treatment facility because of its low cost, good disinfecting power, ease of handling, and excellent safety record.\n\nThere has never been an accidental release of chlorine of any amount at Franzen Reservoir.  The City has accidental release prevention and emergency response policies in place.  These policies minimize the probability of an accidental release and protect the public if an accidental release occurs.  As part of the City's Emergency Response Plan, the City has coordinated these policies and procedures with local emergency responders.  The City has instituted safety procedures and training policies to protect both City employees and the public from an accidental release of chlorine.\n\nAn off-site concequence analysis has been performed to assist emergency responders.  Two release senarios have been performed as part of the analysis, a catastrophic release scenario and a minor release scenario.  The catastrophic release scenario represents the complete release of a container of chlorine gas due to a catastrophic event at the disinfection facility.  The minor release scenario represents the release of a part of the containers contents due to a leak in the container."
