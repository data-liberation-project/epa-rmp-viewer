Appropriate responses to release of Ammonia (anhydrous) are documented in the Risk Management Program (RMP) document. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs will be fully implemented by JBS Prepared Foods personnel and contractors and are coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts. \n\n(b)\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nJBS Prepared Foods provides employment for approximately 350 workers in Council Bluffs, Iowa. This facility is a meat processing plant owned and operated by JBS USA, LLC, which has headquarters at 1770 Promontory Cir., Greely, CO 80631.  \n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  JBS Prepared Foods receives raw meat (i.e., pork, turkey, beef and pork bellies). The meat is processed by washing, grinding, mixing with spices, and cooking. Some of the cooked meat is smoked, sliced and packaged on site for retail sale as sandwich meat, while the balance is shipped off site for further processing.  The pork bellies are washed, smoked, sliced and packaged as bacon for retail sale. From the time the meat products are received and throughout the processes conducted, the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing an Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulation.\n\n(c)\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess"
