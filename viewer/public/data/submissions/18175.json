The anhydrous ammonia tanks are located at the rear of the property, where they are unlikely to be struck by vehicles.  \n\nActive prevention measures include inspection of all tanks annually, at the end of the season.  All required repairs are completed prior to further use.  Further inspections are preformed semi-annually by the Missouri Department of Agriculture.\n\nEmergency response policies are as described below.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThis facility is located on the north edge of Smithton City, Missouri, and supplies anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  The facility has one bulk anhydrous ammonia tank with capacities of 12,000 gallons.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the ammonia operation envisions a catastrophic failure of the storage tank, possibly preceded by failure of the safety relief valve.  Regulatory and procedural controls limit the amount of anhydrous ammonia in the tank to approximately 85% to 88% of capacity.  Using RMP*COMP, the toxic endpoint was calculated to be at 2.6 miles.  This would include virtually the entire town of Smithton City.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves hose being broken or damaged, allowing product release.  This event could occur only in conjunction with failure of the excess flow valve.  The toxic endpoint for an anhydrous ammonia release is 0.5 miles.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe facility complies with both 29 CFR 1910.111 (Anhydrous Ammonia).\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have no accidents involving releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility is located "

      "SummaryText": "on the edge of Smithton City, Missouri.  This is a seasonal operation, and there are no permanently assigned employees at this location.  The tank does not contain ammonia, exept during the application season.  In season, employees will notify the fire department in the event of a major release.  The General Manager and other designated employees are authorized to take appropriate actions to stop small releases by shutting off valves, etc.  Other employees will notify the fire department, and evacuate the area as necessary.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThere are currently no changes to the safety/release prevention programs planned."
