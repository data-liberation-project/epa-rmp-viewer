The Gallo Winery facility operations include the production, aging and storage of wine. In addition, the facility also bottles wine and other wine products.\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\nThe facility operates anhydrous ammonia based closed loop heat transfer refrigeration systems.\n\nThe refrigeration process begins in a high-pressure receiver where ammonia transfers through an expansion device into an evaporator.  Heat transfers into the low-pressure liquid ammonia which causes boiling and evaporating.  Low pressure, low temperature, high volume ammonia vapor moves into a compressor to compress the volume, which increases both temperature and pressure of the ammonia vapor. Next, in the condenser, heat transfers out of the high-pressure vapor which causes cooling and condensing.  The now liquid ammonia is transferred back to the high-pressure receiver. (Taken from Figure 2-5, Industrial Refrigeration Course 1, Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association)  \n\nConsistent with this RMP submission, Gallo complies with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, the California Accidental Release Prevention Program, program level 3. The facility also follows Federal and California Process Safety Management regulations (CFR 1910.119 and Title 8 CCR ? 5189) to manage safety and integrity of the covered processes and equipment.  \n\nGallo senior management continues to commit the financial and human resources necessary to safely operate covered processes and equipment.  The time for appropriate training and education of all employees is managed through annual training programs, job-specific continuing education for operators and technicians, and emergency management training for incident response.\n\nGallo has a detailed emergency resp"

      "SummaryText": "onse plan that describes how the site manages various types of emergencies including hazardous materials threatened or actual release, medical response, fire, external events, and others.  24-hour security staff are on-site to assist as needed.  Staff are trained to respond to the incidents within their level of training and will partner with emergency response personnel as required. Cleanup equipment for various types of chemicals is on-site and available for use in the remediation of incipient spills.  Contractors are on retainer in the event of a larger spill when beyond staff levels of training. When necessary, leaders can initiate a site-evacuation.\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Response Team trained in basic and some advance first aid practices, confined space entry and rescue.  Emergency response trailers are maintained ready for use by trained staff. Members of leadership and management teams have received training in the Incident Command System.  \n\nGallo routinely updates its Hazardous Materials Business Plan (Tier II compliance) to update the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fire Department. The facility has conducted coordinated training events with local fire in the past and will continue that practice based on emergency responder availability.\n\nGallo employs RETA-trained operators, technicians, and supervisory staff.  Ammonia systems are maintained through industry standard based programs for inspection, testing and preventative maintenance. \n\nIn the event of a chemical release, notifications are made to the appropriate agencies including the Stanislaus County Environmental Health Department, the California State Office of Emergency Services, and when required, the National Response Center. \n\nIn the five years prior to this submission, there have been no releases of ammonia at the facility that exceed the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  Neither have there been any accidents involving on-site deaths, injuries, or significant "

New full-time professional EHS staff have been hired to provide expert advice and oversight.  A new training department was also created to manage the development and implementation of the training programs.  Additionally, the facility now has a separate dedicated PSM RMP Coordinator.\n\nThe facility now uses an electronic management system to track action items resulting from its audits, assessments and other reviews of its covered processes and equipment. Our electronic system provides multi-level assurance that action items are completed by sending automated prompts approaching their due dates and provides ready access to all relevant staff, including site operational leadership, to foster increased accountability. \n\n"
