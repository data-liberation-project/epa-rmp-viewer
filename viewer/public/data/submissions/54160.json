Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\n6.  Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are pre-qualified based on their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  In addition, these contractors are periodically evaluated to ensure that they continue to work safely.  All contractor work is overseen by CPI personnel.\n\n7.  A preventative maintenance program is in place at the Tulare facility.  This includes regular inspection of major powered equipment, including compressors,  pumps and large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechanical failure, and regular inspection and calibration of  liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches and shutdown devices that have safety implications.\n\n8.  Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\n\n9.

The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for cheese and curd processing and packaging.  The entire system contains approximately 35,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor). \n\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119).The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n1.  The development of an employee participation program, which includes facility employees from all areas within the plant.\n\n2.  The development, documentation, and availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment. This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n3.  The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using a What-If Protection Analysis. A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the  safety and operability of the system.  The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n4.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe"

Adherence to fire codes and preparation for fires, storms, earthquakes, or other events that could impact the ammonia system.\n\n13. Prevention program compliance audits performed every three years to verify that the appropriate management systems are in place and are being properly implemented.  Any deficiency found in an audit is corrected.\n\n3.0    ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n4.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Tulare facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia.  The plan has been reviewed to assure:\n\nThat the Tulare facility is included in the written community ERP; Specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances are included; That it includes procedures for the public and  local agencies responding to an accidental release; and that it includes information on emergency health care."
