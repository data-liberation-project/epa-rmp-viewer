This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with off-site emergency response support.\n\n\n\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPresently ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for cold storage and distribution operations.  Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Koch Foods (Ashland Facility) is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as conversed in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP COMP was utilized exclusively. The RMP COMP model is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.\n\n\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file at the Koch Foods Ashland, AL Facility (Refrigeration machine room).

Koch Foods (Ashland Facility) is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\nEmergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nKoch Foods current Emergency Action/Response Plan focuses on evacuation of facility personnel and response by trained technicians in the event of an ammonia emergency. The facility maintains a written Emergency Action/Response Plan to document the specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. At this time, the Ashland facility does not have a HAZMAT response team.  In the event of a HAZMAT emergency, the facility will rely on the Ashland Fire Department to respond.  The overall written plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nKoch Foods aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented"
