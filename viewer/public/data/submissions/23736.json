Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nLowell Regional Water Utility (LRWU) is committed to operating the intake station for its water treatment plant in Lowell, Massachusetts in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe workplace for its employees and the surrounding community.  As part of this commitment to environmental stewardship and worker safety, LRWU has developed and implemented numerous environmental and safety programs that are designed to eliminate and/or drastically reduce the potential for accidental releases.  LRWU has also developed and implemented programs designed to ensure that if an accidental release occurs it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to personnel, the environment, the surrounding community, and the intake station.  \n\nLRWU views accident prevention, personnel protection, and environmental protection as continuous processes.  Consequently, LRWU continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs. LRWU?s Risk Management Program complements this overall accident prevention and response program.  LRWU?s Risk Management Program (RMP) complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (\"EPA?s\") Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  This document is the LRWU intake station?s RMP plan, which provides the public with information about the intake station?s processes, accident prevention programs, and emergency response planning efforts.   While many programs are common to both facilities, the water treatment plant is addressed in a separate RMP Plan.  LRWU?s compliance with EPA?s RMP rule includes:\n\n1. Completion of a hazard assessment in compliance with 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart B, including the five-year accidental release history.  \n2. Implementation of a accid"

The intake station?s RMP accident prevention program is coordinated with the intake station and water treatment plant?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Under the RMP rules, the intake station and plant are classified as Level 2 facilities, and must prepare accident prevention programs in compliance with RMP?s Level 2 accident prevention program requirements.  LRWU has elected to prepare a plan compliant with RMP requirements but also with more stringent and extensive Process Safety Management rules administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \"OSHA\";\n3. Implementation of an emergency response program.  As recommended in the RMP rule and by numerous federal response entities, the plant has developed a single Integrated Contingency Plan designed to meet applicable state and federal emergency response planning requirements. \n\nAdditional information regarding how LRWU addresses each of these requirements is provided below and in the attached RMP plan.\n\nWhile the RMP program at LRWU helps ensure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, it is just one component of LRWU?s comprehensive safety and environmental programs.  Additional components beyond the scope of the RMP include, but are not limited to: regular employee/contractor safety training, periodic table-top safety and emergency response drills, acquisition and maintenance of emergency response and personnel protective equipment, development of safe work practices (confined space, lockout/tagout, hot work), implementation of safe work procedures, new project safety review procedures, preventive maintenance and regular inspections of all tanks and equipment that contain hazardous chemicals, chemical control and purchasing procedures, medical emergency response training, contractor certification, etc. \n\nThe intake station is designed and operated to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.

      "SummaryText": "mum, the intake station meets government and industry design and construction standards.\n\nB.  RMP Covered Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nLRWU owns and operates its intake station in Lowell, Massachusetts.  The intake station pumps potable water from the Merrimack River, treats the water with chlorine, and discharges the water to the LRWU water treatment plant.  The only chemical present at the plant in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the chemical accident prevention rule is chlorine.  Chlorine is used to disinfect water as it is pumped from the river.\n\nChlorine is stored in 2,000 lb. tanks within the chlorinator room.  The chlorinator room is equipped with chlorine detectors which sound an alarm in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.  Spare tanks are kept in a covered, fenced outdoor shed.\n\nThe total maximum amount of chlorine stored on-site is 24,000 lbs. (12 tanks).  The maximum amount of chlorine used at any one time in the chlorination process is 8,000 lbs (two active and two backup tanks connected at a manifold).\n\nC. Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, LRWU?s off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release and an alternative release for each covered chemical (chlorine).\n\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as \"a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ? 68.22.\"  40 C.F.R. ? 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, with the release occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind, which would not disperse a release very effectively. Further, the model assumes that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released instantaneousl"

      "SummaryText": "y.  According to the Chlorine Institute, no 2,000 lb. chlorine tank has ever released its contents in ten minutes.  The probability of a 2,000 lb. cylinder of chlorine instantaneously releasing its contents in Massachusetts on a 96?F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour is extremely low.\n\nUsing the EPA mandated criteria described above, the worst-case release at the intake station (for purposes of RMP) would involve a complete failure of a 2,000 lb. chlorine tank, filled to maximum capacity.  If such a release occurred, the resulting vapor cloud could impact persons outside of the intake station?s property line.\n\nLRWU developed an alternative release of chlorine that focuses on more realistic release scenarios occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  EPA requires modeling of a release which could impact off-site locations. After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, the Process Hazard Analysis performed on the chlorination process, and the past release, LRWU has chosen an alternative release scenario that involves a valve failure in the chlorinator room. This scenario is based on an actual release which occurred in 1996.\n\nApproximately 53 pounds of chlorine were released during to the environment during this incident.  The incident lasted approximately fifteen minutes, at which point the leak was sealed.  The chlorine leaked as a liquid and vaporized into gas immediately.  The chlorine gas was vented from the chlorinator room to the outside by exhaust fans.  The release did not cause any injuries, property damage, or environmental damage, and no off-site evacuation was needed.\n\n\nD. Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nLRWU has developed an accidental release prevention program designed and implemented to reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.   The program complies with the requirements of OSHA?s Process Safety Management rule (found. at 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119) and is analogous to, but more extensive than, "

Even prior to the implementation of this plan only a single reportable release had occurred at the intake station.\n\nThe basic elements of LRWU?s prevention program are described below: \n\n1.0 Employee Participation.  LRWU has developed and implements a written plan of action regarding employee participation in the safety and accident prevention process.  The plan describes how employees are:  (A)  consulted and what input they will have in the development of process hazard analysis (PHA) and other PSM and RMP safety elements; and (B) given access to PSM and RMP information.   \n\n2.0 Process Safety Information.  LRWU has compiled written process safety information, which helped identify the hazards posed by chlorine, handling of materials, management, storage activities, and the chlorination process in general.  The compilation of process safety information provided the foundation for understanding the hazards involved in the chlorination  process and was crucial to the development of a complete and thorough process hazard analysis (discussed below).

LRWU performed its most recent process hazard analysis (PHA) on the chlorination system in March 1999.  The PHA is a key component of the  process safety management system and LRWU?s RMP accident prevention program.  It provided a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling hazards posed by the chlorination process.  The PHA utilized the what-if/checklist PHA methodology in accordance with 29 C.F.R. ? 1910.119(e) and 40 C.F.R. ? 68.67.  \n\nThe PHA addressed: (1) hazards of the process; (2) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases (e.g., process monitoring and control instrumentation with alarms); (3) consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls; (4) facility siting; (5) human factors (human error); and (6) a qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on the employees in the work place.\n\n4.0 Operating Procedures.
