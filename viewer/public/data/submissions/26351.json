THE TOTAL CAPACITY OF OUR NH3 PLANT IS 122,500 TOTAL POUNDS. THE PLANT CONSIST OF 1-16,000 STORAGE TANK AND 12 1000-GALLON NURSE TANKS.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF THE LARGEST STARAGE TANK WHICH INCLUDES 70,000 POUNDS. THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT WOULD BE .80 MILES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 500 RESIDENTS. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE WOULD HAVE A RUPTURE OF A TRANSFER HOSE, RELEASING 30.000 POUNDS AND HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPONT OF .33 MILES AFFECTING NEARLY 50 CITIZENS. \n\nTHE FACILITY HAS EMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF ANSI K-61, OSHA 29 1910.111 AS WELL AS THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. THE STATE ENSPECT OUR PLANT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT. OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS IN GENERAL SAFETY, THE HAZARDS OF AMMONIA, OPERATING PROCEEDURES AND MAINTENANCE PROCEEDURES OF A TRPICAL FACILITY. THE EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES AND GOGGLES DURING LOADING OPERATONS. ADDITIONALLY CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ON HAND DURING NURSE TANK FILLING OPERATIONS. WITH THIS IN MIND, IT'S ESPECIALLY EASY TO REPORT THAT NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES HAVE OCCURED AT THIS LOCATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. \n\nTHIS FACILITY HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN AND HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND THEY'VE AGREED TO ASSIST IN TEH EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY INCIDENT. \n\nTHE OTTAWA COOP IS COMMITTED TO SAFETY. THERE ARE MANY HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH AMMONIA. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A PROPANE STORAGE TANK IN THE AREA OF THE AMMONIA PLANT, WE AT THIS TIME FEEL THAT IT POSES NO THREAT TO THE AMMONIA PLANT OR THE AMMONIA PLANT TO THE PROPANE STORAGE. WE REQUIRE EACH EMPLOYEE THAT LOADS AMMONIA BE TRAINED EVERY THREE YEARS AT A STATE SPONSERED TRAINING SCHOOL AND YEARLY TRAINED"

ALL EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO INSPECT THE AMMONIA PLANT BEFORE FILLING PROCEEDURES AND BEFORE USE DO A VISUAL INSPECTION OF ALL HOSES AND VALVES TO MAKE SURE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FAILURE OF EQUIPMENT SINCE THE LAST TIME IT WAS USED. ALL RUST SPOTS ON STORAGE AND NURSE TANKS WILL BE CLEANED AND PAINTED TO KEEP RUST TO A MINIMUM. EMPLOYEES ARE REMINDED TO FOLLOW START UP PROCEEDURES BEFORE FILLING AND DURING FILLING NURSE TANKS. ALL ACCIDENTAL RELESES OF AMMONIA WILL BE REPORTED TO LOACAL AUTHOURITIES AND TO THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. IF AFTER ANALIZING RELEASE IT IS FOUND THAT 100 POUNDS OF AMMONIA WAS RELEASED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WILL BE NOTIFIED. \n\nWE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING AS POTENTIAL HAZARDS TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND COMMUNITY.\n1.
