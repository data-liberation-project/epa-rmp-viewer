A vessel is defined as a blend or storage tank, pipe, hose, drum, tote, tanker or railcar when uncoupled from the motive power.\r\n\r\nAn example of a regulated process would be storage of Aqua Ammonia, with a concentration of greater than 20%, in an aboveground storage tank containing 22,500 pounds of the regulated substance. The threshold is 20,000 pounds and therefore, exceeds the threshold by 2,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe regulated process at the Rock Hill facility includes on-site movement of Aqua Ammonia, 29.4%.  This process requires a worst case and alternate scenario consequence analysis to determine the impact to off-site receptors. The analysis involves the development of scenarios depicting a release from a vessel or several vessels in a group to determine the extent of impact to the public.\r\n\r\nA worst case scenario involving ammonia is considered to be the entire release of the contents from a tote at night, during the summer, with stable atmospheric conditions. The gas would extend to a distance of 0.1 miles (the toxic endpoint), disperse slowly because of low wind conditions and potentially impact an approximate number of persons in the area surrounding the release.\r\n\r\nThere were two total scenarios developed for the facility to comply with the RMP: worst case and alternate.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nThere is no accident history to report for this facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nProgram 2 requires a prevention program that establishes a systematic approach to compliance.

The RMP includes an analysis of potential off-site consequences of an accidental release, five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.\r\n>\tCovered facilities must also submit the RMP, which includes registration information, to the EPA no later than June 21, 1999, or the date on which the facility first has more than a threshold quantity in a process, whichever, is later.
