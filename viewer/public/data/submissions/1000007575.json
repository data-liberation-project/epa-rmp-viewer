      "SummaryText": "The Para-Chem site is located on a 130-acre parcel of land near Simpsonville (Greenville County), South Carolina. Para-Chem produces acrylic polymers through water-based emulsion polymerization reactions. This process utilizes a number of chemicals as raw materials, three of which are listed as toxics under 40 CFR 68.130:   acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and aqueous ammonia.  Less than 2% of a fourth listed compound, formaldehyde, is a residual reactant in a monomer, N-methylolacrylamide.  Two of these chemicals, acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate monomer, are present in quantities above the threshold limits set forth for the RMP program. Furthermore, the process in which these chemicals are used is listed under SIC code 2821, making Para-Chem subject to level 3 program requirements.\n\nAcrylonitrile is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid. Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of acrylonitrile include irritation of the respiratory tract experienced as nasal discomfort and discharge, with chest pain, coughing, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness. At high doses acrylonitrile can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact and other routes. The threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 for acrylonitrile is 20,000 lb. Para-Chem uses acrylonitrile as a raw material in an emulsion polymerization reaction and stores a quantity greater than the threshold amount in its monomer tank farm. Para-Chem has not had an accident or incident involving a reportable quantity of this material in the last five years.\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid. Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of vinyl acetate monomer include irritation of the respiratory tract experienced as nasal discomfort and discharge, with chest pain, coughing, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness. Liquid or vapor may cause irritation of the eyes experienced as stinging, excess blinking and tear production, with e"

Para-Chem has not had an accident or incident involving a reportable quantity of this material in the last five years.\n\nAmmonia is also handled and stored as a non-refrigerated, aqueous liquid. Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of ammonia include eye, mucous membrane and systemic irritation by inhalation. At high doses ammonia can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, and possibly other routes. The threshold quantity for ammonia is 20,000 pounds [40 CFR 68.130]. Para-Chem uses aqueous solutions of ammonia in many of its\nprocesses and stores 26 A?B?? (~29.5 wt%) aqueous ammonia in a horizontal tank. The aqueous ammonia has the following properties:\n\nAqua Ammonia Specifications\n(Ref: Industrial Resources Group http://www.indresgroup.com/aqua_safety.htm)\nAmmonia Content/Assay - 29.4% by weight\nDensity - 26 A?

Para-Chem has not had an accident or incident involving a reportable quantity of ammonia in the last five years.\n\nPara-Chem uses 37% formaldehyde solution in the production processes in very small quantities, and the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for N-methylolacrylamide indicates that this monomer may contain a maximum of 2% formaldehyde by weight. N-methylolacrylamide is stored in a tank. The maximum amount of formaldehyde stored with N-methylolacrylamide and as formaldehyde solution at Para-Chem is less than the threshold quantity of 15,000 pounds [40 CFR 68.130].

This allows these facilities to develop an emergency action plan to ensure employee safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response plan provided that they coordinate with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the facility.\n\nPara-Chem operates in a manner that attempts to minimize hazards associated with the handling of chemicals. Para-Chem has several mechanisms in place for addressing a release of a regulated hazardous substance. These include the following:\nA? A Spill Contingency Plan that documents the emergency contacts\nA? An employee safety manual\nA? ISO 9001 Procedures for unloading railcars and tank trucks\nA? A severe weather plan\n\nThe Spill Contingency Plan that was developed in conjunction with the Process Hazard Analysis for the Polymer Manufacturing Process contains detailed information relating to materials stored on site, potential failures of equipment, and methods for containing or cleaning up lost materials.
