Ammonia refrigeration systems designed, installed and maintained in accordance with International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) consensus standards.  \n3.  Training, preventive maintenance and other specific programs within the context of the PSM rule and IIAR recommended practice. \nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set, for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.",

Individual responsibilities are shown and described in our RMP Organizational Chart and RMP Management Duties.  We use a comvination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides activities that we have designed and implemented including:\n1)  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation.  \n2)  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.  \n3)  A five year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.   \n4)  An overview of our emergency response program.  \n5)  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.  \n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:  \nThis corporation processes poultry.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration equipment to keep the poultry cool or frozen during processing or storage.  Anhydrous ammonia has been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Our facilities qualify as Risk Management Program 3 facilities because we also are covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule (29 CFR 1910.199).  \nTOXICS:  \nAnhydrous ammonia is a toxic gas regulated by EPA under the clean air act section 112 R Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  Fieldale Farms Corporation has anhydrous ammonia in various interconnected vessels, piping and equipment which make up our ammonia refrigeration system.  Our refrigeration system contains in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold quantit"

Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public and the environment by our use of these chemicals. \n3.0  OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS SCENARIOS:  \nEPA's RMP rule requires that we conduct off-site conequence analysis for the worst-case accidental release and alternative accidental release scenarios, this has been done.  Worst-case and alternative release scenarios for regulated flammable chemicals are not appicable. \n5.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facilities.  W\\ithin the past five years, Fieldale Farms Corporation Murrayville Complex has had no reportable accidents involving anhydrous ammonia.  \n6.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  \nWe maintain an intergrated plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during an emergency response.  In the event of an emergency involving ammonia refrigeration systems, it is our policy to notify the National Response Center, the State EPD and by dailing 911 the local emergency responders.  We request the local agencies to respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Fire Departments and members of the Fire Department have been invited to visit our facility.  \n7.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:   \nNone."
