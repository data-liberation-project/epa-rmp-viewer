The following items list employee-related prevention policies and procedures:\n     1.  Adequate training for process personnel, including periodic refresher programs.\n     2.  Availability and use of appropriate personal protective equipment.\n     3.  Proper supervision.\n     4.  Positive reinforcement for safe work practices (Employee Safety Day and bonuses).\n     5.  Timely investigation of all accidents and injuries by the City's Safety Committee and prompt response \n           to Committee recommendations.\n     6.  Use of hot work permits.\n\nThe equipment related aspect involves the following:\n     1.  Review of process to ensure the mechanical integrity of all equipment, before pruchase and after \n          installation.\n     2.  Maintenance schedules for all equipmend to ensure optimum equipment performance and relliability.\n     3.  Scheduled periodic calibrations.\n     4.  Easily understood and readily available written instructions for equipment start-up, operations,         \n          shutdown procedures and trouble-shooting.\n     5.  Use of the safer method of vacuum delivery rather than pressure delivery of chlorine and sulfur \n          dioxide.\n\nMinimization in the event of an accidental release involves adequate detection devices,   appropriate leak repair kits, and rapid notification of Emergency Response Team.  Employees are trained in proper notification procedures.  Periodic drills are conducted by the Emergency Response Team to ensure optimum response capabilities should a release occur.  Process location in the center of a City owned complex reduces the number of potential off-site receptors.\n\nThe wastewater treatment facility is a 4 MGD plant.  Processes c"

      "SummaryText": "overed by the Risk Management Plan include chlorination for disinfection and dechlorination with sulfur dioxide prior to river discharge.  Maximum on-site storaage at any one time is 16,00 pounds of chlorine and 8,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.\n\nWorst case scenarios for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide involve the relaeas of the entire contents of a full, one-ton container over a period of ten minutes.  This scenario encompasses a radius of 1.3 miles from the center of the process unit.  This scenario would impact 12,100 residents, a school, residents, a light commercial/office area, City parks, and the City's Public Works Department's complex.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine and sulfur dioxide are based on transfer hose failure and encompass a radius of 0.1 miles.  This release would impact 40 residents and a small portion of a light commercial/office area.\n\nThe City's commitment to chemical safety is exemplified by this facility's accident history.  We have had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide during the past five years.  No accident with off-site consequences has ever occurred at this facility.\n\nThe City's Fire Department is notified immediately to respond if a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak is detected.  The Fire Department coordinates with th local Volusia County Emergency Operations Center and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The Fire Department also coordinates public notification and evacuation procedures, as necessary.\n\nSeveral changes are planned to improve safety at this facility.  Some are costly and will be completed during the next budget year with an estimated completion date for all changes of October 1, 2000.  Planned changes include:\n     1.  Installation of additional gas detection sensors.\n     2.  Installation of remote alarms for the gas detection devices.\n     3.  Improved labeling and signage for area and processes.\n     4.  Development of a more extensive training program.\n     5.  Purchase of an ad"
