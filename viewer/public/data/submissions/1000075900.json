              "Description": "1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n Process safety information (PSI)\n\n Process hazard analysis\n\n Operating procedures\n\n Training\n\n Mechanical integrity\n\n Management of change\n\n Pre-startup review\n\n Compliance audits\n\n Incident investigation\n\n Employee participation\n\n Hot work permit\n\n Contractors\n\n\n\n2.0 PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule, we systematically control the creation, updating, and retention of written documentation associated with our process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment.    \n\n\n\n2.1 Process Safety Information Details\n\nWe maintain chemical process information for each regulated substance in a covered process as well as for other hazardous materials in both covered and noncovered processes.  We use safety data sheets (SDSs) to provide most of the process chemical information.  Whenever required information, such as corrosivity data or hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing, is not available in SDSs, we develop the missing data from other sources and provide it in separate documents.\n\n\n\nWe maintain the following required process technology information:  Block flow or simplified process flow diagram, Process chemistry, Maximum intended inventory, Safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, flow, or composition and evaluation of the consequences of deviations from established operating limits.  We also maintain information pertaining to equipment in our regulated processes.\n\n \n\n3.0 PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule, we use process hazard analyses (PHAs) to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.  The most important products of our PHAs are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases.  We ensure that all recommendations from our PHAs are resolved appropriately, and we ensure that information from our PHAs (including recommendation resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees.\n\n\n\n3.1 Process Hazard Analysis Details\n\nWe have conducted systematic PHAs of our regulated processes and other hazardous processes at our facility.  We update/revalidate each PHA at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes).  We also conduct PHAs of all new processes before those processes are placed in service.  Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience, including at least one person who has knowledge and experience in the process to be evaluated and a PHA team leader trained in the application of the hazard evaluation technique used for the PHA.\n\n\n\nWe have a system in place to promptly resolve PHA team findings and recommendations, and we communicate findings/recommendation resolutions to potentially affected personnel.  PHAs are implemented in a written report for each analysis soon after the analysis meetings are completed.  Our managers review and resolve the PHA recommendations after receiving the report.  We maintain a written action plan tracking the resolution status of each recommendation, including an individual responsible for resolving each recommendation and a target completion date.  We document the final resolution of each recommendation, and we advise the PHA team of any recommendations that are rejected.\n\n\n\n4.0 OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.69 of the RMP rule, we use operating procedures to define how process-related job tasks assigned to our personnel should be performed to avoid incidents.  We use these procedures to (1) train our employees before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, and (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs.\n\n\n\n4.1 Operating Procedure Details\n\nOur Area Superintendants, operators, and shift supervisors work together to develop and maintain our operating procedures for all phases of operations.  In addition to our process-specific procedures, we also develop and maintain more widely applicable safe work practices addressing issues such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control of access to processes.  These safe work practices apply to our employees and our contractors.\n\n\n\n5.0 TRAINING\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.71 of the RMP rule, we train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process/equipment changes are made.  \n\n\n\n6.0 MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.73 of the RMP rule, we maintain the mechanical integrity (MI) of our process equipment using an inspection and testing program and a quality assurance program, and we ensure that our equipment is designed and installed correctly so that it operates properly.  We train our maintenance personnel in the hazards of the process, and we also provide additional training on procedures for maintaining the ongoing integrity of our process equipment so that job tasks are performed safely.\n\n\n\n6.1 Mechanical Integrity Details\n\nWe consider all process-related equipment and safety systems that are critical for preventing and/or mitigating releases of regulated substances to be covered by our MI program.  Our procedures for safe work practices and safety policies specify safe practices for performing maintenance tasks such as lockout/tagout, hot work, confined space entry, line or equipment opening, and control over entry/exit for a covered facility by plant and/or contract maintenance personnel.  We identify equipment deficiencies through our inspection, test, and preventive maintenance activities or from routine operating and maintenance tasks and correct them promptly.  If we cannot immediately correct identified equipment deficiencies, we implement protective measures to ensure safe operation until repairs can be made.\n\n\n\n7.0 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.75 of the RMP rule, we evaluate and approve all proposed changes (i.e., modifications that are not replacements in kind) to covered process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures prior to implementation through our management of change (MOC) program.  This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that our employees and contract employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes.  We use this close scrutiny of all changes to help ensure that changes do not adversely impact employees, public safety, or the environment.\n\n\n\n7.1 Management of Change Details\n\nWe analyze each proposed change and confirm that the technical basis for the change is appropriate, safety and health impacts of the change are understood and appropriate controls are in place, procedures are modified as appropriate for the change, permissible time period is established for temporary changes and change is authorized by appropriate personnel\n\n\n\n8.0 PRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.77 of the RMP rule, we perform a pre-startup review as a final check to ensure the safety of a new or modified process before it is placed in service.\n\n\n\n8.1 Pre-Startup Review Details\n\nWe perform pre-startup reviews on new stationary sources and on modified stationary sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  We use a Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form as an aid in documenting the performance of our pre-startup reviews.  Our checklist contains a list of safety questions covering process considerations that must be addressed prior to startup.  The person responsible for the project or maintenance task prepares the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form and provides the names of the reviewer responsible for confirmation of each of the pre-startup review safety questions.  Each reviewer signs off on the checklist and approval form when satisfied that all assigned safety questions are complete and no problems exist.  All reviewers must sign off on the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form before startup can be authorized.\n\n\n\n9.0 COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.79 of the RMP rule, we audit our RMP-covered processes to be certain that our prevention programs are effective.  Our compliance audit program seeks to confirm that RMP prevention program practices for the covered process are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n\n\n9.1 Compliance Audit Details\n\n\n\nWe conduct and certify compliance audits of the prevention programs for RMP-covered processes at least every three years.  We integrate these audits into PSM audits.  Our audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the size and complexity of the processes to be audited.  \n\n\n\n10.0 INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.81 of the RMP rule, we perform incident investigations to help ensure that incidents with catastrophic magnitude or potential are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence.\n\n\n\n10.1 Incident Investigation Details\n\nWe investigate all incidents (including near misses) that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a large uncontrolled release of a regulated substance, serious injuries to our employees or the public, and/or damage to the environment.  We train our employees to identify occurrences requiring investigation and to notify the appropriate person should such an event occur.  Any recommendations and develop action plans are tracked to completion.  We review the incident investigation report and action plan items with employees (and contract employees, as appropriate) who work in the affected area and/or perform job tasks relevant to the investigation findings.  We retain incident reports for at least five years.\n\n\n\n11.0 EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.83 of the RMP rule, our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing RMP.\n\n\n\n11.1 Employee Participation Details\n\nWe have a written employee participation program that meets RMP requirements.  In this document, we describe in detail the many different ways that employees participate in each element of the RMP regulations.  We periodically update this document as changes occur.\n\n\n\n12.0 HOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.85 of the RMP rule, we use our hot work permit program to ensure that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near an RMP-covered process.\n\n\n\n12.1 Hot Work Permit Details\n\nWe studied OSHA's fire prevention and protection regulation 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and developed a procedure that addresses these requirements.  We also created a Hot Work Permit Form to document job requirements, the dates for the hot work, and the object on which the work is to be performed.  \n\n\n\n13.0 CONTRACTORS\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.87 of the RMP rule, we have a contractor screening procedure to help ensure that we hire and use only contractors who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of our plant employees, the public, or the environment.\n\n\n\n13.1 Contractor Details\n\nWe have a detailed contractor safety program that applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to an RMP-covered process.  We provide a safety orientation for Contractor Supervisors before they begin work on site.  We then take the Contractor Supervisors on a tour of the job site to point out the hazards we discussed in the meeting, introduce our personnel with whom they will communicate, identify break and restricted areas, note locations of alarm boxes, and show where medical attention may be provided.  This program does not apply to contractors providing incidental services that do not influence process safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
