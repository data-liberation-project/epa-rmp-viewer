This facility will utilize anhydrous ammonia (Chemical Abstract Service [CAS] #7664-41-7), a regulated substance, during normal operating procedures.  The FCP facility will process and store ammonia in quantities above the Federal and State regulatory threshold quantities and therefore, is submitting a Risk Management Plan (RMP), as required under the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, Section 112?.  A Program 3 RMP is being submitted due the proximity of the facility to off site receptors.\n\nWellco Services, Inc., the operator of the FCP facility, is dedicated to operating a safe facility.  Wellco employees are trained in every aspect of hazardous materials management, from using personal protective equipment (PPE) to performing maintenance on facility equipment.  All employees are trained in emergency evacuation procedures.  A written program for maintaining and inspecting the ongoing integrity of all regulated substance process equipment ensures that equipment receives appropriate, regularly scheduled maintenance.  Regular inspections document and identify the condition and reliability of each piece of equipment.  Maintenance on tanks containing ammonia will be performed weekly (unless otherwise stated) and consist of visual inspection and preventive maintenance activities.  General tank condition will be inspected and maintenance performed when deemed necessary.  Changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures will be implemented when necessary.  Before a process change occurs, management of change protocol will be implemented to ensure a safe and smooth transition.\n\nWellco will perform a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for the new ammonia tank and for any modification significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup safety review shall confirm that, prior t"
