Regular audits are conducted to ensure that these programs are in place and functioning well at the Martinez plant.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe process unit at the plant regenerates sulfuric acid from \"spent\" sulfuric acid which is received from oil refineries. Oleum is also produced as an intermediate in the process. Current operations and maintenance at Martinez is performed by 45 full time employees. Contractor personnel are used for some maintenance activities as required by plant operations. Contractor personnel receive training in accordance with their potential exposure to hazardous materials or when assigned to work with equipment which could affect the processing or the handling of hazardous materials. \n\nSulfuric acid is the primary product at the facility. The core customers for the Sulfuric acid are refineries where the Sulfuric acid is used in the manufacturing process for gasoline.  The strength of the acid produced at the Martinez Plant varies from 93% to 99.5%. These different acid strengths satisfy a wide variety of applications, including metals mining, processing pulp and paper, agricultural chemicals and pesticides, and water treatment.\n\nThe chemicals used or stored in the Martinez plant that are covered by the RMP regulation are anhydrous ammonia (NH3) and oleum (H2SO4 supersaturated with SO3). Table 1 identifies the location, quantity, and function of these hazardous materials. \n\nTable 1\n\nMaterial:           Ammonia\nUnit:                 Ammonia Storage\nFunction:         Removal of sulfur dioxide from effluent gas\nProgram Level: 3\n\nMaterial:           Oleum\nUnit:                 Oleum Tower (and circulation loop)\nFunction:         Process Acid\nProgram Level: 3\n\n3.

No credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario.  The effected distance for the WCS was calculated using the look-up tables in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants that was officially accepted by the EPA on October 28th, 1998.  These look-up tables were used to be consistent with other stationary sources that store anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for each toxic substance stored on site was selected from the results of the process hazard assessments that were done for each unit.  The scenarios were modeled using PHAST.  PHAST is a dispersion modeling program that takes into consideration more details than the look-up tables allow.\n\nAmmonia Alternate Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nThe ARS associated with the release of ammonia at the Martinez plant is defined as a leak in a hose during the unloading of an ammonia truck.  The driver is present at the unloading station during the entire unloading process. The truck is equipped with an emergency handle in the back that closes the valve if pulled. The driver can use the emergency handle to close the valve as soon as a problem is observed. For this scenario it was assumed that it takes the driver 3 minutes to pull the emergency handle. This is a conservative assumption because the driver should be able to close the valve in less than one minute. \n\nThe unloading hoses are property of the ammonia distributor. Before allowing the truck to unload, a Rhodia operator completes a safety checklist. This checklist includes checking the date the hoses were last officially inspected and conducting a visual inspection on the hoses. Employees are expected to turn away any truc"

      "SummaryText": "k that does not pass the safety checklist for any reason. This has been a successful preventative measure. \n\nOleum Alternate Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nThe ARS associated with the release of oleum at the Martinez plant is defined as a leak in the circulation loop for the storage tank. A 1/8\" failure in the pipe was assumed. It was also assumed that the resulting leak continues unnoticed for two hours, which is a conservative assumption because a visible cloud would make the leak immediately noticeable to operating personnel.  The operating personnel could then shut down the unit remotely from the control room. \n\nMartinez plant operations personnel perform routine visual inspections of the oleum process piping 7 days per week. Oleum piping is formally inspected and documented at least every 5 years as part of the Maintenance Integrity and Maintenance Management program. \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Rhodia Martinez Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Rhodia Martinez Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are LOPA, HAZOPs, Checklists, and Fault Tree Analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in risk analysis, engineering, process operations, and maintenance.  All process hazard analyses are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard an"

An evaluation of the identified options to reduce the inventory of anhydrous ammonia on site was performed which resulted in administratively reducing on site storage of anhydrous ammonia to a maximum of 45% of tank capacity.  This solution was implemented in June 1999; however the site retains full use capability of the storage system.  Lube Spent Acid (LSA) handling and Oleum storage and loading were both eliminated at the Martinez Plant since the 1999 RMP submittal.  Lube Spent Acid handling and Oleum storage and loading were discontinued as of September 2003."
