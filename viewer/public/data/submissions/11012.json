Barrett takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals.  Barrett has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Grand Valley Gas Plant processes approximately 60 mmscf/day of natural gas.  The station provides compression, dehydration, and recovery of liquid hydrocarbon compounds. The facility has three 30,000-gallon hydrocarbon product tanks, with a maximum intended inventory of 151,800 pounds in each. \nRelease Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario has been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For the worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one of the 30,000-gallon hydrocarbon product tanks or 120,000 pounds) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  The distance to the flammable endpoint (1-psi overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion) was determined to be 0.4 miles using the EPA RMP Comp.  There are no residences, or public or environmental receptors within a 0.4-mile radius around the facility.\nPrevention Steps for Hydrocarbon Product and Natural Gas Condensate\nSince t"

      "SummaryText": "his facility qualifies for Program 1 compliance, there are no regulatory requirements for a prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  \nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described in detail in the Company Emergency Action Plan and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings and training that focus on chemical and process safety issues are held periodically at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."
