It is the policy of Dakota Yeast LLC to comply with all Federal, State and Local laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nDakota Yeast operates a yeast manufacturing facility located in Wahpeton, Richland County, North Dakota.  Aqueous ammonia, at 30% concentration, is a key component in the manufacture of yeast as a nitrogen source.  Liquid ammonia is fed into the sealed process and is completely consumed during the process.  The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored on-site is 120,000 pounds.  No other regulated substances are handled in excess of the RMP threshold quantities. \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, and through implementation and maintenance of the program manual and the program itself, Dakota Yeast has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on site and updated as needed.  Periodic functions such as hazard reviews, training, compliance audits, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis as needed and in accordance with the required frequencies in the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo ammonia accidents causing death, environmental or property damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering have occurred in the last five years at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is a policy of Dakota Yeast to notify the local (Dwight Township Fire Department and/or City of Wahpeton) Fire Departments and evacuate all employees from the facility.  Dakota Yeast is a non-responding facility.  The process has a distributed control system (DCS) that "
