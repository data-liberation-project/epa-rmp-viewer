      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe Poet Biorefining-Groton, facility (formerly James Valley Ethanol) is located approximately 1.5 miles west of Groton, SD in Brown County.  The main product of the Poet Biorefining-Groton facility is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  Production at the facility was initiated in May 2003.  Poet Biorefining-Groton produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is mixed with water and digestive enzymes to produce starch.  Secondary enzymes are added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars.  Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 20% alcohol and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two 2,000,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas condensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per federal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is stored in Tank No. 805, which has a capacity of 60,000 gallons (approximately 380,000 pounds), or in tank No. 802, with a capacity of 175,000 gallons (approximately 1,100,000 pounds).  NGC is blended with the ethanol via in-line blending and then shipped directly from the facility in tank trucks and rail cars.\n\nCHEMICALS REGULATED UNDER THE EPA CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical present at Poet Biorefining-Groton which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.  The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage tank, the in-line blending equipment and the associated transfer equipment and piping.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration of 1% to 3%.  The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping system is the maximum capacity of the largest denaturant storage tank (1,100,000 pounds), located in the cent"

In the event of an emergency, the Poet Biorefining-Groton Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety.  In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of Poet Biorefining-Groton to notify the Groton Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nPoet Biorefining-Groton is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  Public access to the facility from the highway is restricted by a gate.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based alarm system.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors).  The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms.  All of the facility storage tanks have secondary storage containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HI"

      "SummaryText": "STORY\nThe facility has an excellent record with regard to minimizing recordable and reportable accidents.  There have been no accidents since startup of the plant in May 2003 which require inclusion in the five-year accident history required by Subpart B of the CAPP/RMP regulation. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Poet Biorefining-Groton management team is committed to an on-going system of reviewing changes in available technologies and any previous plant incidents to identify opportunities to improve plant safety.  Planned changes to improve safety include a new computer based maintenance program (Maximo), which is being implemented to include automatic scheduling and work order generation for all preventative maintenance inspections and tests.\n"
