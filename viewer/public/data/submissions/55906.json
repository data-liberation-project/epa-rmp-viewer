      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBig River United Energy, LLC\n\nBig River United Energy, LLC (BRUE) was formerly owned and operated as VeraSun Dyersville, LLC.  The purpose of this submittal is to prepare and submit a new RMP under the new owner/operator, Big River United Energy, LLC.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nBRUE has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nBRUE 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nBRUE ethanol plant is located in Dyersville, Delaware County, Iowa.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  BRUE has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 5.6 miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.6 miles; due to the amount of ammonia and denaturant stored on site.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 97,200 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud or a release of 560,000 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nFor ammonia, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case toxic cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, recreation areas, and other public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.\n\nFor denaturant, the"

Residence homes are located within this 0.6 mile radius.\n\nAlthough BRUE has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents since the establishment of BRUE.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nBRUE ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  BRUE\u00bfs corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
