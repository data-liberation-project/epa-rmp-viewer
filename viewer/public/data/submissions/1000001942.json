      "SummaryText": "Background;\n   Monte Vista Cooperative Center Fertilizer Plant stores liquid anhydrous ammonia in aboveground storage tank (AST) within its facility. The anhydrous ammonia is used as raw material to produce Ammonium Polyphosphate fertilizer.  The Center Fertilizer Plant also dispenses anhydrous ammonia to nurse tanks for fertilizer application via ammonia transfer pumps.  The properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in its handling.  It is the policy of Monte Vista to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community.  Safety depends upon the competent training of Cooperative personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n\n    \nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n      Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck (transports) or railroad tank cars and is stored in one (1) storage tank.  Anhydrous ammonia is distributed from this facility by nurse tanks.  The facility has the necessary equipment to safely load and unload transports, railcars and nurse tanks.\n     Access to the tank controls and hoses are restricted to authorized employees and management personnel, along with authorized contractors that may work on the facility.\n     The only regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount stored at the site is 628,000 pounds.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations.  The facility design and construction is in accordance with the ANSI K 61.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards.  It is formally inspected a minimum of once a year for compliance to all applicable standards by an o"

Employees of the crop production department at the cooperative receive training to meet Federal and state requirements to handle hazardous materials along with additional training using industry training programs and schools.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n     This site has not experienced a reportable accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the five years pior to the date of submitting this report.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n     This facility relies on the local emergency response unit and does not have it's own emergency response program.  However, employees are familiar with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook, and the local fire department is familiar with the plant. \n\n Process Safety Information (PSI)\nMonte Vista has developed and is keeping current working copies of the PSI including information pertaining to the hazards of the process, the technology of the process, and equipment of the process. All employees are trained in the area where they will perform work and all contractors are given training before entry into the plant is allowed. The PSI will enable the employees and contractors of Monte Vista to identify and understand the hazards posed by the process involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nMonte Vista is committed to performing PHA to identify, evaluate, and control hazards associated with Monte Vista's processes. The PHA is used to analyze potential mishaps, identify the mishaps that could occur, analyze the likelihood that mishaps will occur, evaluate the consequence of these mishaps, and analyze the likelihood that safety systems, mitigation systems, and emergency systems will function properly to eliminate or reduce the consequences of a mishap.\n\nThe PHA will be revalidated at least every five years to assure that the PHA is consistent with the current process.\n\nOpe"

The OPs address:\n-all operating modes (startup, shutdown, etc.)\n-operating limits, consequences of deviations, safeguards\n-health and safety \n-safety systems and functions\nThe OPs are reviewed and maintained to be current and accurate.\n\nTraining\nMonte Vista is committed to provide its employee's comprehensive training to assure that the work force can perform their duties safely, efficiently, and effectively. Employees assigned to a process area are trained in all steps of operating phases including startup, shutdown, normal operations, emergency operations, operating limits, and safety systems and functions. Employees are provided refresher training at least every three years, and annual review of operating procedures.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\nMonte Vista has developed a written program of maintaining the MI of process equipment at the Monte Vista facility. The MI program includes inspection and testing of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems and ancillary equipment, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\nIncident Investigation\nMonte Vista has communicated to all of its employees that it is every employee's responsibility to report incidents and near misses. After an incident is reported, an incident investigation is conducted. Findings and recommendations are promptly addressed and resolutions documented. \n\nCompliance Audit\nA compliance audit of the Monte Vista facility will be conducted at least every three (3) years to evaluate compliance of Monte Vista's process with the release prevention program (RPP). The audit team will include one person knowledgeable in audit skills and techniques and team members with appropriate technical expertise. Recommendations resulting from the audit are addressed and deficiencies documented and corrected.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\nMonte Vista's MOC system was develo"

Monte Vista's MOC system includes the following considerations before any process changes take place.\n-authorization requirement for the change.\n-technical basis for the proposed change.\n-impact of the change on health and safety.\n\nAfter changes are made, all affected employees will be informed about the change and training will be provided to the affected employees prior to startup of the modified process. In addition, the PSI and OP will be updated to reflect the changes made.\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSR)\nWhen change to the process is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the MOC, Monte Vista will conduct a PSR. The PSR Team Leader will develop a checklist and assemble a team of key personnel to go over every element on the checklist during the PSR. All PSR members will be knowledgeable about the process and trained in the area of change.\n\nContractors\nMonte Vista has developed and implemented safe work practices to control the entrance, presence and exit of contract employees in covered process areas. It is Monte Vista's policy to select safe contractors, provide appropriate safety related information to contractors, develop safe work practices related to contractors and periodically evaluate contractors.\n\nMonte Vista will inform contractors of the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractors work and the process. Monte Vista will also explain to the contractors the applicable provisions of Monte Vista's emergency response plan.\n\nEmployee Participation\nMonte Vista is committed to involving employees in the conduct and development of a PHA and on the development of the other elements of plant safety, process safety management, and risk management planning.

A permit is required when hot work is to be conducted on or near Monte Vista's process. This permit ensures that fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to hot work operations.\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n       This facility utilizes the ANSI and OSHA standards as guidelines for the safe storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  At this time there are no further plans to modify or change the facility."
