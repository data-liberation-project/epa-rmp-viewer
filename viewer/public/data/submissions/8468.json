      "SummaryText": "The City of Enid has had no injuries from exposure of Chlorine Gas due to our safety standards and trained personnel.  This Risk Management Plan takes our existing operation to the next logical step, to become responsive to the all encompassing chance of worst case senario.  The documentation provided demonstrates our dedication to the safety of our personnel and the public at large.  The ongoing Training, Standard Operating Procedures, Emergency Response and Emergency Managment are all held at a high level of knowledge and professionalism.\nCity of Enid, Water Production\nChlorine Release/Spill Emergency Evacuation & Response Plan\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI.    PURPOSE.\n\nA.    This plan was developed to provide orderly and coordinated evacuation and emergency response procedures, in the event of an accidental release or spill of Chlorine liquid or gas, within predictable hazard prone areas as well as those situations which cannot be anticipated.  Additionally, this plan strives to identify, and organize supporting transportation services for necessary evacuations.\n\nB.    This plan attempts to define who does what, when, where, and how, in order to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the effects of an accidental release or spill of Chlorine gas or liquid.\n\nII.    SITUATION AND ASSUMPTIONS.\n\nA.    Situation.\n\n1.    The City of Enid, Water Production Plant #1 is located at 1500 West\nChestnut, 249-4926.\n\n2.    Areas of the City of Enid are potential exposures to the hazards of the accidental spill or release of Chlorine liquid or gas, due to the transporting, storage, and use of the one ton cylinders containing the Chlorine needed for the treatment of the City of Enid=s water.  Potential hazards which may occur in or around the city are, vehicle transportation of one ton Chlorine cylinders to and from water production plants in and around the city being involved in an accident.

      "SummaryText": "se or spill may also occur during the process of changing out tanks in the water production plants, or possible mechanical or equipment failure, all of which have the potential for disrupting the community, causing damage, and creating casualties.\n\nB.    Assumptions.\n\n1.    The City of Enid will continue to be potentially exposed  to the hazards identified above as well as others which may develop in the future.\n\n2.    Government officials will continue to recognize their responsibilities with\nregard to the public safety and exercise their authority to implement this\n\n1\n\n emergency evacuation and response plan in a timely manner when confronted with real or threatened Chlorine release or spills.\n\nIII.    CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS.\n\nA.    General.\n\n1.    When conditions warrant evacuation, due to the spill or release of Chlorine\nliquid or gas, the field employees or operators of the water production plants, if             their emergency procedures fail to contain and stop the release, shall immediately\nevacuate the area, move up-wind a safe distance and call 911 to report the situation, the Fire Department Hazardous Materials unit and support companies will be dispatched to preform rescue and mitigation operations, the Enid Police Department patrol units will be dispatched to barricade traffic routes that lead in and out of the area effected, and to aid and warn all residents within the endangered area of the need to evacuate.  It is also necessary to establish a system for the acquisition and effective use of available transportation in the City of Enid.\n\nB.    Considerations.\n\n1.    There are several factors which must be considered when planning for \nevacuation.  First among these are the characteristics of the hazard itself;                 magnitude, intensity and duration.  These factors will help determine the boundaries of the area to be evacuated and available time.  Another consideration is the availability of evacuation routes, their capacity, and vulnerability to the hazard.\n\nIV.    TASK ORGANIZA"
