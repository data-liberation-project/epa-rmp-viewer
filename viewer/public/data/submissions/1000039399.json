These precautions include safety controls (alarms and shutdown devices) which are designed to detect unsafe conditions that could cause a failure.

It is our mission to \"improve the quality of life and share happiness\" using core values of \"service, integrity, quality, and safety.\" We have a zero-tolerance policy for elements that can be harmful to our mission. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  As a poultry processor, a significant amount of refrigeration is required. Anhydrous Ammonia is used at our facility as a cooling medium in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is contained in two separate, closed loop systems. It is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels within these two systems. Ammonia is the only substance at this facility that is covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Allen Harim facility has an Accident Release Prevention Program that complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and the EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n-Employee Participation Program\n\n-Process Safety Information\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-Operating Procedures\n\n-Training Program\n\n-Contractor Safety Program\n\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\n-Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n-Hot Work Permit Procedures\n\n-Management of Change Procedures\n\n-Incident Investigation Procedures\n\n-Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n-Emergency Response Procedures\n\n-Computerized Equipment Maintenance Database\n\n\n\nWe take several precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from these systems.
