This is located 1/2 mile east of the City of Buxton.  We have an emergency response program in effect.  We also report all hazardous chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia, to our local fire department, county emergency response committee, and the state emergency response committee.  We have planned for and have coordinated with local emergency responders to adequately respond to all accidental releases we believe may occur, from a simple hose break to the release of the entire single tank.  We also have had no accidental releases in the last 25 years of using this economical and useful farm product.   by Jamie Reed, Ag Plant Manager."
