After double checking to make sure cylinder valves were off, using the approved cylinder wrench, Shane left the system on (regulators, RPTP, etas. Injectors) for 15 minutes to bleed out any chlorine.  As he loosened the service line connected to the cylinder, he breathed in a small amount of chlorine gas.  He retightened the valve and exited the building.  Due to respiratory problems, Shane Townson was taken by plant personnel to the local emergency room where he was treated by emergency room staff, kept overnight in hospital, and released the following day.  There was no known on-site or off-site damage to equipment or the environment.  \r\n\u00bf\tContributing Factors:  It was determined that chlorine gas was never vacuumed out of the service lines.
