              "Description": "GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Penn Cryo Plant. Because processes at the gas plant are regulated by the EPA's risk management program (RMP) regulation and are also subject to OSHA's PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA's PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.   The plant is subject to EPA's risk management program (RMP) Program 3. The prevention program is outlined in detail in the XTO PSM Manual, revised 1/25/2016.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant encourages participation by employees in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participate as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way\n\nwhich address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in MSDS sheets.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant primarily uses the checklist technique to perform these evaluations. This is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The\n\nanalyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe hazard analysis findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking\n\nassigned by the PHA team.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the team's findings are tracked until they're completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.  Hazard analysis findings will be reviewed anytime equipment or operating procedures are changed.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained. Once the team's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. The reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The team's findings are documented and retained and sent to corporate management for resolution.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant maintains written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees. The procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Penn Cryo Plant maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  The refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find doing their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Penn Cryo plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant has well-established practices for preventative maintenance of pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and compressors. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) performing tests, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (4) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, and (4) emergency response plans to help ensure that work is performed in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or an engineer will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that\n\nadequate controls are in place to manage new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence and forward these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Penn Cryo Plant will conduct an audit every 3 years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit staff members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Penn Cryo Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  Following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Penn Cryo Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential\n\naccident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

XTO Energy demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable procedures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant, located in Renfrew, PA, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, y-grade NGL, and condensate) from natural gas. The Penn Cryo Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane.  There are no regulated toxic substances at the plant. \n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 60,000 gallons (214,200 lbs.).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.50 miles.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account evaluating this WCS.\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is a VCE resulting from the release of 846 lbs from a broken hose to the product loading pump.  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 15 minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is also 0.075 miles.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.   \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACC"

      "SummaryText": "IDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Penn Cryo Plant. Because processes at the gas plant are regulated by the EPA's risk management program (RMP) regulation and are also subject to OSHA's PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA's PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.   The plant is subject to EPA's risk management program (RMP) Program 3.  The prevention program is outlined in detail in the XTO PSM Manual, revised 1/25/2016.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant encourages participation by employees in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participate as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in MSDS sheets.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly train"

The information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant primarily uses the checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  This is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\n\n\nThe hazard analysis findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the team's findings are tracked until they're completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.  Haza"

Once the team's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  The reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The team's findings are documented and retained and sent to corporate management for resolution.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant maintains written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.  The procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Penn Cryo Plant maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find doing their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Penn Cryo plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Penn Cryo Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.
