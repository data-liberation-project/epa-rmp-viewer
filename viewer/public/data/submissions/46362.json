Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n4.1\tEmployee Participation\n\nConvent Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team or incident investigation team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan, entitled Standing Instruction 5.19 - Employee Participation, that is maintained at the refinery. \n\nIn addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives are implemented by teams and include Hazards and Effects Management Process, the Work Process Management, and Global Asset Management Excellence (GAME). The teams typically are made up of members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and management.\n\n4.2\tProcess Safety Information\n \nConvent Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe oper"

Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nEmployees and contractors are informed of the location of process safety information that is relevant to their work.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). MSDSs are readily available through Convent Refinery's computer system. \nConvent Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of  construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical area classifications, piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs), etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.  \n\n4.3\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nConvent Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these potential hazards.\n\nConvent Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the pr"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or  process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original process hazard analysis, Convent Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are entered into a computer data base, assigned to appropriate departments for resolution. Final resolution of the findings is also documented in the data base.\n\n4.4\tOperating Procedures\n\nConvent Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n4.5\tTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Convent Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not  already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives on the job training to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \n\nSkills are maintained through refresher training.

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes, in addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \n\n \t4.11\tIncident Investigation \n\nConvent Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and enters the information into a computer data base for tracking. Each recommendation is promptly assigned to an appropriate department for resolution. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation i"

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n4.12\tCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, audits are periodically conducted to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Convent Refinery's management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented in a computer data base, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n5.0\tCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at Convent Refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all \nProgram 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at Convent Refinery. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Convent Refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain/control a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n2.\tHydrogen sulfide (H2S) detectors with alarms.\n3.\tProcess units manned around the clock.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and  incinerate episodic releases.\n2.\tRemotely activated valves that discharge to a closed flare system for"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including reporting of an emergency, emergency response, first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Convent Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for Convent Refinery is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of St. James Parish. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency  response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. Convent Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials, who have direct communications with local police and fire departments. St. James Parish  maintains a system of emergency sirens located throughout the parish, and the Parish has provided residents with instructions as to what to do in the event of an emergency. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Convent Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the  LEPC and plant, as well as, local emergency response organizations. \n\n8.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nConvent Refinery resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the proc"
