No maintenance on the valves is attempted with the possible exception of tightening the packing if a leak develops.  If a valve is found to be defective, the other container valve may be used or the container is returned to the supplier.  In addition, an auxiliary container isolating valve is used to prevent moisture from entering the piping system during a container changeout.  This isolating valve is the same type of valve as the container valve.\r\nb.\tPVC ball valves- Numerous PVC ball valves are installed on the chlorine gas (vacuum) and chlorine solution lines.  The valves used for vacuum service may require replacement of internal gaskets, O-rings, etc.  These valves are included in the PM system and are exercised regularly.

The OCA was completed using EPA's software program, RMP*CompTM that performs calculations described in the USEPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. In order to complete the Offsite Consequence Analyses (OCA), Appendix F:  Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used since use of chlorine at Central is similar to how it is used at a WWTP.  This guidance provides additional information for wastewater treatment plants (or water pumping stations using chlorine).  The tables and charts from the above referenced guidance that were used to complete the OCA are included in Appendix A. \r\n\r\nAt this point it should be noted that all 1-ton chlorine cylinders are stored inside the pumping station building.  In addition, the active 1-ton cylinder that is feeding chlorine to the water distribution system is also located within an area that includes a caustic scrubber system that is designed to capture a release from an entire 1-ton cylinder and treat it without allowing a discharge of chlorine gas to the atmosphere.  In essence, if a chlorine leak were to occur in a ton cylinder that is connected to the vacuum feed system and the contents of the cylinder were released, the scrubber will respond and the release of chlorine gas to the atmosphere would be minimal.  These additional factors help to mitigate the worst-case release scenario.   Figure 3-1, taken from the above EPA guidance is included to illustrate the effect of releases from chlorine cylinders located inside a building and, potentially, occurring in"

      "SummaryText": "Kalamazoo Area Water System Overview\r\n\r\nThe City of Kalamazoo Public Water Supply System is designed, operated, and maintained by the Kalamazoo Public Services Department, Water Division. (KPSWD). The mission and the purpose of the System is to provide a safe, sufficient, reliable water supply and related services to the public within the Kalamazoo metropolitan area. Ground water provides 100 percent of the water served. The average daily flow rate is about 23 MGD.\r\n\r\nChlorine is used to disinfect the water prior to supply. Chlorine is delivered and used in one ton containers. The containers are stored in storage room.  The Water Supply System uses vacuum system that is inherently safe. These systems involve the use of water flowing through an eductor which creates vacuum. This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system. If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing discharge of chlorine.\r\n\r\nWater Pumping Station #1 Central Overview\r\n\r\nCentral Pumping Station #1 is located at 215 W. Stockbridge Ave. in the City of Kalamazoo.  It is bounded on the north and west side by W. Crosstown Parkway, on the east side by Stockbridge Ave., on the south side by a commercial business and Balch Street.\r\n\r\nThere are a total of six wells located on the property, which supply raw water to the pumping station.  The original pumping Station #1 was built in 1884 and has been abandoned.  The present facility was built in 1995.  The six wells provide a raw water capacity of 6,750 gallons per minute (gpm), or 9.73 million gallons per day (MGD).  There are two 200, one 150, and one 100 hp treated water pumps at this station.  Iron is removed from the raw water through air stripping towers and filters.  Central Pumping Station #1 is on of the two iron filtration plants on the system and is an unmanned facility.

Experience at WPS #1 indicates that it is more probable that a release may occur in other ways.  Specifically, leaks from the connection at the ton container valve may occur if the lead washer is not installed properly.  \r\n\r\nThe procedure for a ton container change out specifies that the operator/maintainer making the connection verify that this connection does not leak by the use of ammonia vapor.  A white vapor cloud will indicate a chlorine release.  However, it is conceivable that the person making the connection may not check the connection and not detect the release by smell (an air purifying respirator is worn during the procedure).  Therefore, the alternative release scenario to be considered is described in the following.\r\n\r\n3.3.1\tAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nA lead gasket is leaking chlorine vapor while a full ton container is in operation, i.e., connected to the supply system and the chlorine room is unattended.  It is assumed that the  of the leak is 3/16 inch in diameter and the release occurs inside the chlorine building with the doors and windows closed and the ventilation fan running.  Under this scenario, the release should be detected by the stationary, chlorine gas leak detector in the area.  The leak detector would alarm and system operators would be alerted.  It is assumed that mitigation stops the release in one hour.\r\n\r\nThe methodology used to calculate the alternative release concentration considers the mitigative effects of the building and interior chlorine room in which the ton containers are located.

In extreme cases, difficulty in breathing can progress to the point of death through suffocation.\r\n\r\nLow concentrations of chlorine gas in the air may have minor irritating effects or may produce slight symptoms after several hours of exposure, but careful examination of persons repeatedly exposed to such conditions reportedly has shown no permanent physiological effect.  The lowest lethal limit for chlorine is estimated to be 430 PPM over a 30 minute exposure time.  This value is related to respiratory exposure.  A few breaths of chlorine in concentrations over 1,000 PPM can be fatal. (Ref 4-2)\r\n\r\nGaseous chlorine combines with water (e.g. perspiration) to form weak hypochlorous acid.  This weak acid can create mild skin burns with symptoms such as discomfort or rash.  Such burns will become apparent most quickly in the sensitive areas of the body, such as around the genitals, between the buttocks, or under the arms.  Liquid chlorine in contact with the eyes or skin will cause local irritation and/or burns.  All symptoms and signs result directly or indirectly from its irritating action.  Liquid chlorine is a very cold liquid, boiling at -34\u00b0C (-9\u00b0F).  Contact with liquid chlorine will result in frost bite.\r\n\r\n4.1.1.2  Permissible Exposure Limits\r\nThe OSHA Per"

Therefore, by default, the operation of WPS#1 falls under Program 2 requirements that imposes streamlined prevention program requirements, as well as additional management system (Section 2.0), hazard assessment (Section 3.0), and emergency response (Section 5.0) requirements.  The KWPS #1 has developed the required prevention program elements to comply with those rules.  \r\n\r\nEPA developed the Program 2 prevention program by identifying the basic elements that are the foundation of sound prevention practices-safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and accident investigation.  Many of these Program 2 elements are already required by other state and federal regulatory programs.\r\n\r\nThe interrelationship of the requirements can be illustrated in this way.

For instance, a chlorine reaction can cause stainless steel to catch fire or melt.\r\n\r\nChlorine leaks are usually confirmed using a standard ammonia test.  This test is safe because it uses ammonium hydroxide (ammonia dissolved in water or moist air) rather than pure ammonia.  Chlorine reacts readily with ammonium hydroxide to form ammonium chloride, a relatively harmless compound.  This reaction forms a white cloud, indicating a chlorine leak.  The continuous monitors now required indicate chlorine leaks automatically, but the ammonia test is still useful for pinpointing the exact location of a leak.\r\n\r\n4.2.2.4  Corrosion - Chlorine reacts with water or moisture in the air to form highly corrosive acids.

If a chlorine line is broken anywhere downstream of the vacuum heads, the vacuum would be broken and the flow of chlorine would immediately cease.  This type of system is inherently safe as opposed to systems which involve the distribution of chlorine under pressure.\r\n\r\nChlorine gas leak detectors- A fixed chlorine leak sensor is installed near the floor in the chlorine room.  These sensors are connected to a two channel chlorine detector panel located in the pump room, near the scale readout.   The detector will alarm at chlorine in the air concentration of 3.0 PPM (low level alarm) and 5.0 PPM (high level alarm).  The alarms are annunciated locally at the detector panel.  The alarms are also wired into the computer system at Water Supply Operations to provide remote alarm indication.

A vacuum condition, created in the feed line by the ejector which is in line of the water supply opens the inlet valve to admit chlorine gas into the regulator.  A diaphragm regulates the vacuum at this point to a closely controlled value.  The system is completely under vacuum from the ejector to the gas inlet valve at the vacuum regulator during operation.  If the water supply to the ejector is stopped, or the operating vacuum is lost for any reason, the spring-loaded gas inlet valve immediately closes to isolate the chlorine supply.  Any gas, under pressure, which might enter the regulator, is vented from the system through the built-in pressure relief valve through a chlorine vent line to the atmosphere outside the Chlorine Storage Room.  If the source of chlorine gas is exhausted, a gas port on the vacuum regulator closes to prevent excess vacuum levels from developing upstream of the vacuum regulator and also prevents any moisture from being drawn back into the operating components or the gas supply lines.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the vacuum regulator features a liquid trap which will trap any liquid chlorine which might enter the regulator.

Several of these safety systems are indicated graphically in Figure 3-2 and are described below.\r\n\r\n4.1.5.3  Vacuum feed system- As described in Section 3.3.4.2, the chlorination system used at the KPSWD is a vacuum-type system.  If a chlorine line is broken anywhere downstream of the vacuum regulators, the vacuum would be broken and the flow of chlorine would immediately cease.  This type of system is inherently safe as opposed to systems which involve the distribution of chlorine under pressure.\r\n\r\n4.1.5.4  Chlorine gas leak detectors -  A fixed chlorine leak sensor is installed near the floor in the chlorine storage and application room.  This sensor is connected to a two channel chlorine detector/alarm panel located on the wall outside of the chlorine room. It is normally located in the booster pump area of the station.  The detector will alarm at a chlorine in air concentration of 10.0 PPM and 3.0 PPM will give a visual warning indication.  The alarms are annunciated locally at the detector panel.  The alarms are also sent to the computer at KPSWD water supply control room. This  provides  remote alarm indication at the control room in the KPSWD administration building.  An audible alarm is also provided locally and remotely. \r\n\r\n4.1.5.5  Emergency showers/eyewashes- The emergency shower/eye wash stations for use in removing chlorine from clothing, skin, or eyes will be available and readily accessible.. \r\n\r\n4.1.6 \t References\r\n4-1.\tThe Chlorine Manual, 5th edition, The Chlorine Institute, 1986.\r\n4-2.\tSax, N.
