      "SummaryText": "Mar-Jac Poultry operates a poultry processing plant at 1301 James St in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  Producing a safe and wholesome product requires that the poultry be processed and stored at low temperatures, so as to prevent spoilage.  Our refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to achieve these reduced temperatures.  The maximum amount of ammonia present is approximately 42,000 pounds.  The processing plant complies with the OSHA PSM rules.  Our equipment is maintained and reviewed to assure safe operation of the refrigeration system.  We recently completed an upgrade to our refrigeration system that will improve safety.  We have installed ammonia detectors along with new compressors, condensers, receivers, etc.\n\n\n\nThere has not been a reportable accident in the last 5 years in the ammonia refrigeration system.  In fact, Mar-Jac Poultry in Hattiesburg, MS has never has a reportable accident as defined by 40 CFR 68.42 .\n\n\n\nIn case of a release, plant management would coordinate with the Hazardous Material Team of the Hattiesburg Fire Department in combined response to the accident.  This response would include public notification and evacuation (if necessary).  Plant personnel are regularly trained and drilled on emergency response procedures.  The Hattiesburg Fire Department periodically tours the processing plant to ensure familiarity with our processes."
