Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nPortland Water District (PWD) is committed to operating its water treatment plant in Standish, Maine in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  As part of this commitment to environmental stewardship and worker safety, PWD has developed and implemented numerous environmental and safety programs that are designed to eliminate and/or drastically reduce the potential for accidental releases.  PWD has also developed and implemented a number of programs that are designed to ensure that if an accidental release occurs, it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to people, the environment and the plant.  Many of these programs have been in place for some time.\n\nPWD views accident prevention, and personnel and environmental protection as a continuous process.  Consequently, PWD continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs.  A recent addition to PWDs overall accident prevention and response program is the development of  its Risk Management Program.  PWDs Risk Management Program (RMP) complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys (\"EPAs\") Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One of the requirements of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan.  This document is PWDs RMP plan and provides the public with information about PWDs processes, accident prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts.   PWDs compliance with EPAs RMP rule includes:\n\n1. Completion of a hazard assessment in compliance with 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart B, including the five-year accidental release history--PWD has never experienced an RMP reportable release or accident at its Standish Wate"

As recommended in the RMP rule and by numerous federal response entities, the plant has developed a single response plan that is designed to meet the emergency response planning requirements applicable to the plant, under a number of applicable state and federal emergency response planning laws. \n\nAdditional information regarding how PWD addresses each of these requirements is provided below and in the attached RMP plan.\n\nWhile the RMP program at PWD helps ensure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, it is just one component of PWDs comprehensive safety and environmental programs.  Additional components that are beyond the scope of the RMP include, but are not limited to: regular employee/contractor safety training, periodic table-top safety and emergency response drills, acquisition and maintenance of emergency response and personnel protective equipment, development of safe work practices (confined space, lockout/tagout, hot work), implementation of safe work procedures, new project safety review procedures, preventive maintenance and regular inspections of all tanks and equipment that contain hazardous chemicals, chemical control and purchasing procedures, medical emergency response training, contractor certification, etc. \n\nThe plant and all equipment is designed and operated to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.

      "SummaryText": "sh, Maine.  The plant treats potable water from Sebago Lake and distributes it to cities in the greater Portland area.  The only chemical present at the plant in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the chemical accident prevention rule is chlorine.  Chlorine is used to disinfect water as it is pumped from Sebago Lake.\n\nChlorine is stored in 2,000 lb. tanks within the chlorinator room.  The chlorinator room is equipped with chlorine detectors which sound an alarm in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.\n\nThe total maximum amount of chlorine stored on-site is 16,000 lbs. (8 tanks).  The maximum amount of chlorine used at any one time in the chlorination process is 8,000 lbs.\n\nC. Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, PWDs off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release for all toxic chemicals and an alternative release for each covered chemical.\n\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as \"a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ' 68.22.\"  40 C.F.R. ' 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind which would not disperse a release very effectively. Further, the model assumes that the entire contents of the largest vessel is released instantaneously.  According to the Chlorine Institute, no 2,000 lb. chlorine tank has ever released it contents in ten minutes.  Accordingly, the probability of a 2,000 lb. cylinder of chlorine instantaneously releasing its contents in Maine on a 960F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour is extremely low.\n\nUsing the EPA mandated criteria described above, the worst-case rel"

If such a \nrelease occurred, it would result in a vapor cloud that could impact persons outside of the plants property line.\n\nPWD developed an alternative release of chlorine that focuses on more realistic release scenarios occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  However, EPA requires modelling of a release which could impact off-site locations. After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, the Process Hazard Analysis performed on the chlorination process and all past releases, PWD has chosen an alternative release scenario that involves a whip failure on the gas side.\n\nIn the valve whip failure scenario, the emission rate of chlorine gas was calculated to be 0.384 lbs./min, based on the maximum release rate published by the Chlorine Institute of 8 lbs/day/degree F.  The chlorine gas would be vented from the chlorinator room to the outside by exhaust fans and then migrate based on meteorological conditions.  PWD has never had a whip assembly failure at its Standish Water Treatment Facility in the past, however, based on discussions with PWD personnel, this scenario was chosen as the most likely to occur.\n\nD. Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nPWD has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed and implemented to drastically reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.   The program complies with the requirements of OSHAs Process Safety Management rule found at 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119 and is analagous to RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.  The program has been very successful as evidenced by the fact that the plant has never experienced an accidental release that requires reporting under EPAs RMP rule.  See 40 C.F.R. ' 68.42.
