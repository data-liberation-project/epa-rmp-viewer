Facility Policy:\n    The owners, management and employees of Mont Eagle Mills Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Crawford County ESDA, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n2..  Facility Information: \n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 78,000 pounds in a large storage tank and   153.300 in nurse tanks.\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:  \n    A.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the large  storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 71,400 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .98 miles.\n    B.  The alternate release scenario, a 3 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of anhydrous  ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 27,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.   \n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n     The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Con"

These regulations administered by the Illinois Deparment of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K51.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. \n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility: not to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage.\n6.  Emergency Action Plan:  The facility has:\n     A.  A written action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38\n     B.  Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III(EPCRA)\n     Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additioanl specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
