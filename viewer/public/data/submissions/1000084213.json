INEOS takes pride in ensuring that the Ashtabula Complex, Plant 2 is designed and operated to prevent hazards in our workplace and maintains well established contingency plans in place in the unlikely event of a mishap.\n\n\n\nControlling risks from hazardous substances is a major part of our \"Safety, Health and Environmental Policy\", which states:\n\n\n\n\"INEOS Pigments is committed to protecting our employees, our neighbors, and the environment. We will maintain a safe and healthy workplace, operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner and assure the safe and secure manufacture, shipment, storage and use of our products and by-products.\n\nSafety is our first priority and, we believe that all safety and environmental incidents can be prevented and that every employee has an obligation to contribute to their prevention by adhering to our 20 Behavioral and Process Principles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure that we operate according to this policy, we have programs in place that provide layers of protection for preventing releases and protecting the public and environment, including:\n\n\n\n- Operating programs that are consistent with the Chemical Manufacturers' Association good management practices\n\n- Management systems that are certified as conforming to ISO-9001 and ISO 14001 International Standards\n\n- Continuing compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations and permits, including OSHA \"process safety management\" and EPA \"risk management program\" standards\n\n- Coordination of our emergency contingency plans with local response agencies\n\n\n\nHazard Assessments\n\n\n\nThe Plant 2 facility includes two primary processes tha"

These processes are called the Chlorination and Oxidation processes and each handles and stores chlorine and titanium tetrachloride as an important part of their operation.  We have assessed the risks that our handling and storage of these substances could present to public health and environment by performing offsite consequence analyses in \"worst case\" and \"alternative release\" scenarios.  \n\n\n\nOur analysis of the offsite consequences for both processes determined that the worst case release would be represented by a release of the contents of a railcar containing chlorine, which, although very unlikely to occur, could result in a release of 180,000 lbs. of chlorine.  Under winds of 3.4 mph the resulting plume could affect a portion of an area within 14 miles of the facility before being reduced below the toxic endpoint.  This area includes an estimated population of 75135 persons, 35,564 residences, schools, hospitals, recreation areas and major commercial, office and industrial areas.  \n\n\n\nOur continuing analysis of release scenarios also addresses more credible situations that reflect actual operating conditions for each process.  These include situations such as tank overflows, pipe ruptures and equipment failures.  This analysis has determined that the most serious of such releases could impact a portion of an area within 0.4 miles of our facility in the case of chlorine and 0.2 miles in the case of titanium tetrachloride.  \n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nIn the previous 5 years, the plant 2 facility has not had an incident which requires reporting under RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nContingency plans are in place at our facility for responding to accidental releases, treating any persons who have been affected by a hazardous substance and rapidly informing local response agencies.
