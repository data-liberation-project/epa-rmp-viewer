      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary \n\n\n\nThe City of Salina owns and operates the municipal water treatment plant, located at 401 South Fifth Street, Salina, Kansas.  This plant uses chlorine for disinfection.  Chlorine is a hazardous substance that, if released, poses a significant threat to the health of plant personnel and Salina citizens. \n\n\n\nThe Salina Utilities Department developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for control of catastrophic releases of hazardous substances, such as chlorine, from the water treatment plant.  Development, implementation, registration, and submittal of the RMP fulfill requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan regulations (Federal Register (FR) 61 [120], p. 31668).  This program continues EPA's commitment to the protection of the public and environment.  The intent of the regulation is to lessen the number and severity of chemical accidents.  \n\n\n\nThe water treatment plant has the capacity to store 36,000 pounds of chlorine.  Since this quantity exceeds the EPA's RMP regulation thresholds, chlorine must be addressed in the RMP.  The water treatment plant does not contain any other toxics or flammables above threshold quantities that are regulated by 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Salina, Kansas (Salina) Water Treatment Plant (WTP) prevents accidental releases of chlorine by training and adhering to codes and good engineering practices.  In the WTP's prevention program, safety information, hazard reviews, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations are continuously updated.  Every employee of the Salina WTP remains aware of the potential for chlorine releases and disturbance of the systems.  \n\n\n\nIn an emergency, the WTP's first consideration is the safety of personnel and the community.  The second consideration is the protection of property, equipment, and the facility. "

      "SummaryText": " The Salina WTP maintains emergency response procedures that allow WTP personnel to respond to releases when possible.  The WTP relies on the Police Department, Fire Department, and the Saline County Emergency Management to assist in responding to emergency situations.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSalina prepared an accidental release prevention program.  Salina WTP's prevention program consists of safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, maintenance, management of change, prestartup review, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation plans, hot work permits, and contractor safety programs.\n\n\n\nTo better understand chlorine and the WTP chlorine system, the Salina WTP compiled chlorine safety information, including: Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS); maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flows; equipment specifications; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the chlorine systems. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Salina WTP analyzed potential hazards associated with the chlorine system to identify, evaluate, and control any risks associated with chlorine.  This process is called a hazard analysis (PHA).  The PHA team consisted of plant management, process operation and maintenance personnel, and consulting process design engineers.  The team analyzed the hazards associated with the chlorine process using a \"what-if\" technique. A portion of Fourth Street is closed to the public, restricting access to chemical delivery, plant maintenance, and trains. \n\n\n\nThe Salina WTP has adopted written standard operating procedures (SOPs) that provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.  The procedures address initial startup, normal operations, normal and emergency shutdown, inspections, temporary operation, restartup, and consequences of deviation. \n\n\n\nThe Salina WTP implemented a Risk Management and Chlorine Safety Training"

Records of the training program, including content of the course, course manual, examination, and record of attendance are maintained.   \n\n\n\nThe management of change program is intended to avoid making any change in the chlorine process, equipment, technology, or procedures that would increase the potential for a hazardous release.  Management of change forms are used whenever the plant considers a change in the equipment or controls of the chlorine system.\n\n\n\nThe prestartup review allows Salina to verify that it has taken appropriate hazard control steps before any new process starts up.  The prestartup review program involves a safety review procedure, schedule, and record keeping checklists.\n\n\n\nPreventative maintenance, inspection, and equipment testing is performed to ensure safe operations at the Salina WTP.  The maintenance program includes a preventive maintenance schedule based on manufacturer's recommended instructions.  The Salina WTP and maintenance contractors continually assess the compliance status of the chlorine facility through inspections and preventative maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe compliance audit process will be performed at least once every three years to ensure that the RMP procedures and practices are adequate and being followed.  To complete a compliance audit, the Salina WTP must demonstrate that documentation, employees' knowledge (interviews), and physical facility (through inspection) comply with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe RMP incident investigation program outlines the RMP investigation process.  If the chlorine incident is reportable, the employee completes an Incident Report form and submits it to the Plant Operations Manager.  An incident investigation team investigates how the incident occurred and determines whether errors can be corrected by instituting general or specific safeguards for the process or whet"

Input from employees with direct working experience with the subject equipment and systems greatly increase the effectiveness of the RMP.  Salina WTP and contract employees operating or maintaining the chlorine process have access to current MSDS, operating procedures, operating training manuals, and the emergency response plan.    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Salina WTP's safe work practices include control of access measures; preventive maintenance, inspection, and equipment testing; breaching containment and lockout/tagout procedures; and hot work permits.  Salina uses a hot work permit program for all work around any flammable vapor areas.  The program appears in this RMP document in order to prevent damage to equipment that contains chlorine gas. \n\n\n\nSalina requires any contractor who works with or near extremely hazardous substances to demonstrate its ability to work safely.  This Contractor Safety Program applies to all contractors providing maintenance, repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to the Chlorination Facility.
