      "SummaryText": "BEAVER FALLS\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nIntroduction\nWPS Beaver Falls Generation, LLC owns and operates a combined cycle power generation facility in Beaver Falls, New York. The plant utilizes aqueous ammonia in a 30% concentration for use in its Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system located within the (Heat Recovery Steam Generator) HRSG to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from the combustion turbine exhaust gas.\n\nThe 30% aqueous ammonia injected into the HRSG is stored in a 9980 gallon horizontal storage tank surrounded by a containment dike capable of containing the entire contents of the storage tank and related piping. No more that 8740 gallons of aqueous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank to an ammonia skid located within the building. The aqueous ammonia is vaporized in an electric heater at the skid. Subsequent to vaporization, the ammonia is mixed with air and then blown to the injection grid. The grid is a simple pipe system with outlets inside the HRSG.\n\nThe generating plant is subject to U.S. EPA regulations governing Accidental Release Prevention requirements Risk Management Program under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68). This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G. This RMP certifies that WPS Beaver Falls generation plant has instituted a Risk Management Program at the WPS Beaver Falls generating plant that is in compliance with U.S. EPA Accidental Release Prevention requirements.\n\nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the formal published by U.S. EPA. In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, the RMP identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios, the potential off-site consequences of those releases, and the facility\u00bfs five-year accidental release history. This RMP certifies that prevention and emergency response programs are in place so as to min"

In addition, WPS Beaver Falls generation plant has implemented operating procedures, training, maintenance, and emergency response procedures to ensure the risks associated with plant operations are minimized and employees, nearby populations, and the environment are protected.\n\nWPS Beaver Falls generation plant has also implemented environmental programs and procedures to ensure compliance with all environmental regulations. These programs and procedures, maintained in manuals at the facility, are kept up to date and available to all plant personnel. The program consists of the environmental permits and plans required to operate the facility.\n\nThe plant manager has overall responsibility for maintaining the risk management program. Safety information is maintained at the facility. Operating procedures have been implemented at the facility and address the possible conditions of the ammonia system. A maintenance program is in place and consists of maintenance procedures, testing and inspection schedules, and a work log system that tracks work and inspections performed on the ammonia system. Hot works procedures, along with other hazards permits (Tagout, etc.) for the facility equipment system are required to comply with the facility\u00bfs contractor safety program.\n\nAll personnel must complete initial and refresher training on procedures applicable to their position. All operators and maintenance personnel undergo a qualification process, which addresses ammonia system operating procedures and/or maintenance procedures along with emergency response training. Administrative personnel must undergo emergency response training. \n\nCompliance audits are conducted on a biannual basis. These audits consi"

The program audit reviews the risk management program and procedures to ensure the program is being implemented. The ammonia system safety review consists of an audit of the ammonia system and operating procedures and interviews with plant personnel to ensure that the ammonia system is designed and operated in accordance with the appropriate safety information.\n\nEmployees are included in hazard reviews and incident investigations. In addition, employees participate in regular safety meetings and attend annual training in emergency response and ammonia safety. The WPS       Beaver Falls generating plant has also implemented incident investigation procedures. \n\nProgram Level Identification\nThe WPS Beaver Falls generating plant has not had an accident on off site release of ammonia. However, the \u00bfworst case\u00bf release, as defined by the EPA, results in concentrations at public receptors that exceed the toxic endpoint for aqueous ammonia listed in Part 68, Appendix A.  Aqueous ammonia is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard nor is the process listed among the nine NAJCS codes. Thus, the WPS Beaver Falls generating plant aqueous ammonia process is subject to Program 2.\n\nEmergency Response\nThe WPS Beaver Falls generating plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect facility personnel and public safety, as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to an aqueous ammonia leak at the site. The program addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, accountability for all personnel in an emergency, notification of outside agencies and the public, and clean up and decontamination. In addition, the plant has written procedures for inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment. All maintenance and operations personnel are trained annually to the"

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The facility has communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations to facilitate public protection and quick response to an emergency at the facility. In addition, periodic drills that involve local emergency response agencies are conducted at the facility and the facility provides the Solvay fire department with access to the plant for preplanning and hazard assessment purposes. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe WPS Beaver Falls generating plant has an excellent record of accident prevention and there have been no reportable accidents over the past 5 years involving the release of aqueous ammonia."
