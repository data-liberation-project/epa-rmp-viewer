The facility\u00bfs mission is to protect public health by providing our community with safe drinking water, free of harmful pathogens.  Approximately 300 pounds per day of chlorine gas are used to disinfect the water and make it safe for human consumption.  A maximum of 16,000 pounds of chlorine are stored on-site.  The chlorine is stored as gas that is liquefied under pressure in containers that contain 2,000 pounds each..\n                                                                                                                                                                           CHLORINE PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT SAFETY\n    The chlorine system is a vacuum regulated system with an automatic shut-down mechanism when a loss of vacuum occurs.  The system is divided into two separate banks of chlorine containers; one for the water plant and one for the wastewater plant.  An automatic switchover system from an empty container to a full container is built into the vacuum regulator.  The entire chlorine system is housed in a separate building designed specifically for this purpose.  Approximately 16,000 pounds of chlorine are kept in the building at any time.  Within the building, an alarm system and a sodium hydroxide scrubber have been installed.  At the first indication of any chlorine release within the building, the alarm system is activated.  An external visual and audible alarm is sounded at the same time the scrubber is activated and the building is sealed.\n                                                                                                                                                                                   RISK"

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n    At the turn of this century water borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States.  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine\u00bfs introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.\n    The use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n    As an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n    Cooper City Utilities has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.  Cooper City Utilities\u00bf track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, Cooper City Utilities has taken a comprehensive approach to be in full compliance with the RMP re"

The RMP Update, which is presented every five years, reports any process changes or if a new process is added.  The OSHA PSM regulation has basically the same requirements as the prevention program element of the EPA RMP.  The Cooper City Utilities West Treatment Facility (CCUWTF) RMP meets the requirements of both regulations.\nThe following sections briefly summarize the elements of the CCUWTF\u00bfs RMP:\n                                                                                                                                                                                   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n   The results of this scenario are not being reported for security reasons.\n                                                                                                                                                                     ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n    The results of this scenario are not being reported for security reasons."
