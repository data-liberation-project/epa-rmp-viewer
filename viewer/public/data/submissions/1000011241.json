      "SummaryText": "General Facility Summary:  The primary business of this facility is the treatment of wastewater for a connected population of approximately 140,000.  The activity requires the use of chlorine gas as a disinfection agent and the use of sulfur dioxide gas as a dechlorination agent.  Both gases are stored in the form of liquid under pressure and are delivered to the facility via truck.  The gases are stored in isolated halves of the \"H\" Building (Chlorine building) in one ton steel cylinders.  The maximum amount of chlorine tons stored on site is 15.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide tons stored on site is 4.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases are distributed from the ton cylinders by piping through vacuum regulation systems to separate chlorinator and sulfonator rooms.  Chlorine gas is injected in water under vacuum to create a solution, which can be fed to various points in the treatment system.  Sulfur dioxide is fed in similar manner but only at a location following the chlorine disinfection point.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Policies:  It is the general policy of the City of Wyoming Clean Water Plant to take all precautions and preventative measures necessary to ensure against unplanned releases of any hazardous substances.  Safety regulations, policies and Process Safety Management (PSM) procedures have been properly developed with regard to state and federal regulations and in concert with the City Risk Manager.    \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The Clean Water Plant has a rigorous PSM program in place to address the hazards posed by chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  In addition, the Clean Water Plant has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), designed to address spills of other hazardous materials stored onsite that do not meet the quantity requirements of this RMP.  There are numerous structural and administrative safeguards in place which are intended to prevent hazardous materials relea"

Plant personnel receive extensive training unique to the Clean Water Plant and the chemicals used in it.\nThe Clean Water Plant is fenced and gated.  Access to buildings, including where the hazardous materials are stored, is only by key or key-card.  In addition, the entrances and buildings are monitored 24/7 by surveillance cameras.  Multiple mechanical safeguards are in place on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders, piping and regulators.  Alarms for high or low vacuum are transmitted to an alarm panel located in the control room, which is also staffed 24/7.\n\nFive Year Accident History:  In the five years preceding the date of this document, there have been no releases of substances mentioned within this RMP that have resulted in off-site property damage, evacuation, injuries or death.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The Clean Water Plant regularly communicates with the Kent County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), and has a formal emergency response plan on file with them.  In addition, the Wyoming Fire Department is familiar with the facility, and has conducted Hazardous Response trainings at the site.  \nThe areas where leaks could occur are continuously monitored by chlorine and sulfur dioxide monitors.  Certain detection levels trigger alarms, prompting the operator to verify the leak.  If one is verified, 911 is called, multiple PA announcements are made and the buildings are evacuated.   Subsequent calls are placed to the Kent County LEPC, National Response Center and the MDEQ.  The Wyoming Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials group are the primary responders for the facility.  Any additional evacuation measures or public notification is managed by the Wyoming Fire Department.\n\nProjected Safety Enhancements:  The Clean Water Plant will likely be eliminating the use of chl"
