              "Description": " Sistersvilles's prevention program for RMP covered processes includes all required elements of the OSHA PSM prgram.  This includes an employee participation program which covers all phases of employee participation program within process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires assembling of PSM required information prior to a PHA and retention of key PSI information for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of the process.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgable in regards to the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Action plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Major process hazards are formally doumented through a site Operational Safety standard program and unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site Crtical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures follow a preset format including all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated in a timely manner with team composition based upon the complexity of the incident.  An MOC program is maintained which includes Pre-Startup, Facility Change review and Replacement in Kind packages utilized for all changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practicies, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalent codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including Hot-work, Hazardous work permits, Confined space entry, Master tag/lockout and Line breaking are in place and followied by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment.  Other required safety training is conducted for all personnel at a frequency prescribed by internal needs and regulatory requirements.  Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and includes assessments of the PSM program at the site.  Internal audits are undertaken of selected PSM elements in each unit during the course of each year through the managers audit program.  The bulk of prevention is through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills through the use of alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of the process.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgable in regards to the PHA process, unit technology, engineeringstandards and an operator.  Action plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Major process hazards are formally doumented through a site Operational Safety standard program and unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site Crtical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures follow a preset format including all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated in a timely manner with team composition based upon the complexity of the incident.  An MOC program is maintained which includes Pre-Startup, Facility Change review and Replacement in Kind packages utilized for all changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practicies, manufacturer's recommendations and prevlaent codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including Hot-work, Hazardous work permits, Confined space entry, Master tag/lockout and Line breaking are in place and followed by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment.  Other required safety training is conducted for all personnel at a frequency prescribed by internal needs and regulatory requirements.  Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and includes assessments of the PSM program at the site.  Internal audits are undertaken of selected PSM elements in each unit during the course of each year through the managers audit program.  The bulk of prevention is through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills through the use of alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

This includes an employee participation program which covers all phases of employee participation program within process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires assembling of PSM required information prior to a PHA and retention of key PSI information for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of theprocess.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgable in regards to the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Action plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Major process hazards are formally doumented through a site Operational Safety standard program and unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site Crtical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures follow a preset format including all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated in a timely manner with team composition based upon the complexity of the incident.  An MOC program is maintained which includes Pre-Startup, Facility Change review and Replacement in Kind packages utilized for all changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practicies, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalent codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.

Other required safety training is conducted for all personnel at a frequency prescribed by internal needs and regulatory requirements.  Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and includes assessments of the PSM program at the site.  Internal audits are undertaken of selected PSM elements in each unit during the course of each year through the managers audit program.  The bulk of prevention is through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills through the use of alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",
