No off-site injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage has occurred involving materials and processes covered under the EPA's RMP rule since formation of this company.  Prior to Aril 1, 1996 DuPont operated the site and reported no off-site injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe site has an Emergency Response Plan, which establishes procedures and responsibilities for the various functions involved in handling any plant emergency, either internal or external to this site.  This plan consolidates all the federal, states, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Drills are conducted on a regular basis and are coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of the site's process hazards review procedures, all of the processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.

Chlorine usage at this process can require that four tanks be unloaded each day.  While the process is operating, the site tries to maintain twenty chlorine tank cars on-site with a stop order point at twenty-five tank cars.  Because the deliver time is seven days, the site may have thirty-five to forty tank cars when the process has a long unscheduled shutdown.  Chlorine storage of the tank cars was chosen as a process for RMP reporting purpose.\n\nThe chlorine tank cars are maintained, inspected and serviced by the chlorine supplier.  Once at the site, DuPont Dow performs visual inspections prior to unloading.  If a problem is found with the tank cars, the emergency response team will respond until the chlorine supplier arrives at the site.  \n\nSince DuPont Dow does not perform any type of work or maintenance on the tank cars sections 7.7 and 7.8 are not applicable.  The RMP submittal date (6/18/99) was entered on these two sections because leaving them blank will generate errors on the submittal.\n\nA PHA for this process was conducted during the first two weeks of June 1999.  No recommendations were issued in this report.  According to the RMP Submit instructions, if no recommendations are issued Item 7.4c can be left blank.  In our submittal it was found that leaving this item blank generated errors.  The submittal date of this report was used on this item to prevent errors."

EPA defines the worst case scenario as a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance.  The scenario assumes the entire quantity is released in ten minutes, even if it is impossible to do so.  Since the worst case scenarios are very improbable the EPA has included the requirement for companies to report alternate case scenarios, in order to facilitate emergency response planning with the community.  These alternate case scenarios provide a more realistic picture of what could actually happen if the safety systems used by a facility were to fail.\n\nThe following are brief summaries of these scenarios.  These scenarios were developed using the guidance and technical data supplied by the EPA.  EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) was used to determine the offsite impact of chlorine and butadiene.  The TRACE dispersion modeling software from the SAFER program was used to determine the offsite impact of nitrogen tetroxide.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Chlorine\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic chemical is the failure of one chlorine storage tank.  This tank has a capacity of 253,000 pounds.  Per EPA's guidance no mitigation controls were considered.  This release has an off-site impact.  This scenario is unlikely to happen due to tank design and construction and extensive programs implemented to ensure the mechanical integrity of the tank and associated equipment.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Chlorine\n\nThe alternate case scenario for chlorine is the failure of a 1.5 corrugated liquid chlorine"

This release has an off-site impact.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Nitrogen Tetroxide\n\nThe alternate case scenario for the nitrogen tetroxide is a small pipeline leak.  This release does not have an off-site impact.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemical - Butadiene\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is the failure of the butadiene storage tank. The maximum storage in this tank is 900,000 pounds.  Per EPA's guidance no mitigation controls were considered. This release has an off-site impact.  This scenario is unlikely to happen due to the tank location and the programs implemented to ensure its mechanical integrity.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemical - Butadiene\n\nThe alternate case scenario for the flammable substance is a butadiene pipeline leak from a blownout gasket.  The release duration for this scenario was assumed to be 4 hours.  This release does not have an off-site impact.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDuPont Dow takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program follows OSHA's Guidelines and is directed toward preventing serious, process-related incidents which might affect plant personnel, off-site communities, the environment, or result in significant property loss or loss of business.  It involves the application of systems and controls to chemical and manufacturing processes in a way that hazards are identified, understood and controlled so that process-related injuries and incidents are prevented.  The process safety management systems include the following items:\n\n* A thorough understanding of the process technology, including the safe limits of the processes and the proper materials of co"
