      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Mennel Milling Company of Michigan operates a large mill in Dowagiac, Michigan, that processes wheat into many different grades of flour.  Several of the grades involve a process in which chlorine is added to the milled flour to achieve a desired pH.  In addition, a small amount of chlorine is added to the wheat prior to storage and milling to inhibit microbial growth.\r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling Co. and used in one ton containers.  The supplier delivers full chlorine containers to the site via truck.  The containers are unloaded and stored in the indoor storage area by the use of an overhead crane rail hoist.  Mennel Milling staff connects the ton containers to the feed system.  The maximum number of ton containers is 6 (12,000 pounds).\r\n\r\nMennel Milling Co. uses vacuum feed systems that are inherently safe.  These systems involve the use of air or water flowing through an eductor that creates a vacuum.  This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system.  If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of chlorine gas.\r\n\r\nMennel Milling Co. has contracted with Research Products Co.(REPCO) of Salina, Kansas to perform preventive and corrective maintenance on the chlorine feed systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLICIES AND PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nMennel Milling Co. has developed a comprehensive environmental, safety, and health management system that includes PSM/RMP.  The relevant elements of this program include:\r\n\r\n  \u00bf  Duties and Responsibilities \r\n  \u00bf  Information and Training \r\n  \u00bf  Management of Change & Pre Startup Safety Review\r\n  \u00bf  Employee Participation \r\n  \u00bf  Process Technology \r\n  \u00bf  Process Hazards Analysis \r\n  \u00bf  Mechanical Integrity & Process Equipment Specifications\r\n  \u00bf  Process Safety Information \r\n  \u00bf  Contractor"

This plan contains measures that Mennel Milling Co. staff can take to alert employees to a release, how to distinguish between an incidental release and a significant release, and many other elements.  Mennel Milling Co. staff receives training to allow for defensive action in response to an on-site release.  In the event of a chlorine release, Mennel Milling will contact the Dowagiac Fire Department for technical support.  The fire department is trained and equipped to respond to chlorine incidents.  The facility has coordinated its emergency response activities with the City of Dowagiac Fire Department and the Cass County Emergency Management Coordinator (EMC) and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\r\n\r\nMennel Milling Co. has reviewed hazard evaluations previously prepared for the chlorination processes at the facility.  As a result of this evaluation, several changes have been implemented to improve safety.  These changes include (but are not limited to):\r\n\r\n  \u00bf  Methodology for tracking audit findings to completion and ensuring corrective actions are sustained.\r\n  \u00bf  Annual review and certification of written operating procedures \r\n  \u00bf  Training for all affected employees that includes testing to validate the effectiveness of the traini"
