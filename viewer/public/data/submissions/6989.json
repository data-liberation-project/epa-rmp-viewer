We have demonstrated our commitment to safety and the safe handling of anhydrous by excellent safety record and the training we have done both internally and externally.  The primary acitivity we are involved in with anhydrous ammonia is the recieving from trucks to storage, and filling nurse trailers from storage tanksfor our farmer owners. This acitivity is heavly regulated by OSHA, EPA, DOT,and the Kansas Department of Agriculture. Our storage plant holds 184,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in our 3 storage tanks. The largest tank is an 18,000 gallon storage tank that holds 79,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which is limite by design standards. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas in 10 minutesThe distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.89 miles. The alternative release scernario is a release from a break in the transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint in this case (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles. Our firm has an emergency response plan and over the years have shared this plan with our local emergency personnel. We also are inspected on an annual basis by the Kansas Department of Agriculture (who follows the ANSI K-61 standards) and have participated in the Kansas Right-To-Know program in which we report quantities of hazardous materials to the State of Kansas. The facility has implemented all of the standards the industry, government and insurance advisors have required and requested. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that has caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations sheltering in place, property damage of envionmental damage.
