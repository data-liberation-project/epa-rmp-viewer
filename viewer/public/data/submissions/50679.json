The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  \n\nThe overall emergency response at the Tyler Refinery is coordinated with the Smith County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The Tyler Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, police department). \n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Tyler Refinery is constantly seeking to improve the safety of the plant.  Safety recommendations result from Process Hazard Analyses and other safety reviews.  The following comments highlight some of the changes being considered:\n\n      Improvements to the Emergency Response and Action Plan for releases.\n      Improved Emergency Response Training.\n      Installation of isolation valves for select operations.\n      Revisions to written operating procedures.\n      Revisions to written safety procedures and retraining of personnel."

(located in Tyler, Texas), a wholly owned subsidiary of Delek US, operates a typical petroleum refinery of approximately 50,000 barrels per day.  The Tyler Refinery is required to comply with U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.\n\nA.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDelek Refining Ltd. seeks to provide a safe work environment for their employees as well as ensure the safety of those offsite.  In addition, Delek Refining Ltd is keenly aware of the potential environmental impacts of their operations and they are committed to minimizing the negative effects of their processes on the environment, and complying with 40 CFR Part 68 (Accidental Release Prevention) Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nB.  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe refinery is divided into several process units that work in combination to produce the end products of gasoline, butane, propane, etc. from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammable substances in covered processes including Hydrogen, Methane, Ethane, Ethylene [Ethene], Propane, Propylene [1-Propene], Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Butene, 1- Pentane, Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-], 1-Pentene, and flammable mixtures of the above substances (including Naphthas, various grades of Gasoline, an"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) (WCS) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each required scenario are shown in Sections 4 and 5 of the Risk Management Plan.  To perform the required Off-Site Consequence Analyses (OCA) for our facility, we have used the RMP*Comp program and/or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA's) OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The WCS indicate that our releases of flammable substances may only affect very limited residential population in the immediate vicinity of the refinery.  The detailed information is not included in the Executive Summary per the recent Homeland Security Act directions.\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\nTyler Refinery personnel strives to take all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 provisions.  In addition, the refinery is required to comply with OSHA PSM by completing Process Hazard Analysis Studies.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Release Prevention Program that are in place at the Tyler Refinery.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nDelek maintains and updates a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure, hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  The refinery has documented safety-related limits for certain process parameters, such as, temperature, level, and composition, in its Unit Operating Procedures manuals."

      "SummaryText": "The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\nDelek has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Tyler Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until th"

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Tyler Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nThe Tyler Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, emergency shutdown, and normal shutdown.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure that they are current and accurate.  These procedures are also updated whenever a change is implemented that affects the process chemicals, technology, or equipment in an operating process. \n\nIn addition, Tyler Refinery maintains in its Unit Operating Procedures manual procedures that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\nThe Tyler Refinery has work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) A procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed sa"

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills, demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nThe Tyler Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  Inspections are performed both on-line and when the equipment is scheduled down for inspection and repairs. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Tyler Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and the proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nThe Tyler Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chem"

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRs)\nThe Tyler Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or significant facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Tyler Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nThe Tyler Refinery investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nDelek encourages employees to participate in all facets of pro"

Examples of employee participation include updating procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. \n\nCONTRACTORS\nThe Tyler Refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, and (5) understand and follow site safety rules.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with information about safety and health hazards and emergency response plan requirements prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Tyler Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nE. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Tyler Refinery is very concerned with maintaining a safe work environment for their employees and preventing any negative impacts on the surrounding community.  There have been two minor accidents in the previous 5 years despite attempts to provide a safe working environment.  These accidents had no impact on the environment or the safety of the surrounding residents, but did cause injury to one onsite employee each.  One accident involved the explosion of a steam boiler that released 500 pounds of flammable substances.  The accident is not reportable under the RMP rule and is not included in Section 6 of the plan per the EPA\u00bfs guidance, as the release of flammable substances was from the process where the substance amount is below the RMP threshold quantity.  The other accident was a fire on a small plastic bucket with gasoline, which caused an injury of an on-site employee because of inhalation of fire smoke.  Details on the accident are provided in Section 6 of the plan.\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\n\nTh"
