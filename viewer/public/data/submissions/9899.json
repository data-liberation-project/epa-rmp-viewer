THE FACILITY POLICY\n\nTHE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF CENTRAL COOP ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING 0F FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS, AND PROPANE SALES AND DELIVERY.\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.  PROPANE GAS IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DELIVERY FOR HOME HEATING, FARM AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESS USES.\n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 570,000 POUNDS IN OUR 60,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK AND OUR NURSE TANKS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF PROPANE GAS STORED WOULD BE 108,000 POUNDS IN OUR 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 263,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.51 MILES.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85 PERCENT CAPACITY (108,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN"

THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85 PERCENT (108,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN TWO-THIRDS OF A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE.  ACCORDING TO EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS (FACTOR OF.67 X .43 MILES = .29 MILES) .29 MILES.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\".  IN ADDITION, MINNESOTA DEPT OF AG RULES.  FOR PROPANE, NFPA-58 RULES.\n\n5. THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nA. THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA OR PROPANE IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT:\n\nHAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY; NOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS:\n\nA.  A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nB.  PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT TO KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n\nC.  COORDINATED WITH LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ONGOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY.
