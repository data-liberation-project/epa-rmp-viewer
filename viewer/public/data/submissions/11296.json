Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\nIn this facility we handle Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate and Propane which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  We observe certain safety precautions in handling these materials to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personnel health as well as our co-workers and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nOur emergency response program is based on information provided to us by our suppliers of these regulated materials.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with the Senatobia Fire Department and Ferguson Harbour Incorporated in whom we have entered into an agreement with for them to be our primary responder in the event of a accidental hazardous material release.  The emergency response plan procedures for the notification of these agencies as well as the Local Emergency Planning Committee in the event of a accidental release.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of residential dinette furniture and contract office seating.  Toluene 2,4 and 2,6-diisocyanate are used in the molded foam manufacturing process for our seating.  The 2,4 and 2,6 TDI mixture is stored in a 6,000 gallon closed tank located inside the plant in the foam building section. The Propane is kept on site as a back up fuel for the operation of our plant heating in the event of a shortage of natural gas.  The Propane is stored in a 30,000 gallon propane storage vessel located on the west side of the facility.   Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substances handle"

Administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenario, including\n\nPropane:\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the Propane storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would result in a vapor cloud explosion with the release of 106,335 pounds of propane.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 60% at 77 F.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1psi for the worst-case scenario is 0.47 miles.\n\nAlternative Scenario. - A puncture or hole area of 2 square inches with an ignition source resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  The release rate would be 5400 pounds per minute with a estimated distance to the lower flammability limit of <0.1 miles.\n\nToluene 2,4-diisocyanate:\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the TDI storage tank would result in a release of 43,555 pounds of Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate.  The release would be into a diked area of 918 square feet and a building floor area of 854 square feet.  The release rate to the outside air would be less than .0008 pounds per minute making the estimated distance to toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nToluene 2,6-diisocyanate:\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the TDI storage tank would result in a release of  10,889 pounds of  Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate.  The release would be into a diked area of 918 square feet and a building floor area of 854 square feet.

The processes using the regulated materials have been designed using all applicable federal and industry standards including the NPGA standards for Propane storage and the SPI's Safety Guidelines for working with TDI.\n\n5. Five-year accident history.\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of any of the regulated materials in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon emergency response and specific chemical information provided by the suppliers of both the TDI mixture and the Propane.  We have contracted the services of Ferguson Harbour Incorporated to be the primary responder to any accidental hazardous material releases.  FHI will provide emergency response for accidental releases or spills 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  We have discussed this program with our local Fire Department and Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7.
