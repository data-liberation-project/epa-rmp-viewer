The facility possesses no more tha 12 one ton cylinders for the two covered processes at any time on the site. The chlorine is used as a biocide. Chlorine has been used in accordance with the facility's safety procedures without incident at the facility.\n\nThe chlorine processes at the Pinellas County waste to Energy facility are subject to OSHA 1910.119 requirements for Process safety management (PSM). Compliance with PSM requirements as supplemented by the RMP specific requirements are the basis for the facility's accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe response program includes notification of the County's HAZMAT team located at the Pinellas Parl Fire Department in the event there is an incident or release of chlorine. Personnel at the facility are trained on the notification procedures.\n\n(b) The stationary source and the regulated substances handled:\n\nRESPONSE: Pinellas County Waste to Engery is a resource recovery facility operated by Wheelabrator Pinellas, Inc. that converts municipal solid waste into electrical energy through a combustion process. The sole regulated substance subject to RMP requirements is chlorine as defined in (a) above.\n               \n?

      "SummaryText": "d at two sites. Five (5) cylinders are located at the cooling tower and seven (7) are located at the Pond Pump Station Chlorination Building. The worst-case scenario for the 5 cylinder located at the cooling tower is the release of the contents of one of the one ton cylinders of chlorine. Using this scenario, the end point distance from the site is 0.9 miles.  According to Landview6 and the 2000 census data, there are no residents within the affected area. The alternate case scenario for the 5 cylinder location is a single cylinder release with a toxic end point of <0.1 mile. The 2000 census indicates that there are no affected residents within the vulnerable zone of this release.\n\nThe worst case scenario release for the 7 cylinder location is the rupture of a single cylinder. With a 10 minute release for the entire contents of the cylinder, the vulnerable zone would be 0.9 miles with no affected population based on the 2000 census data. The alternate case scenario for the seven cylinder would also be the release on the entire contents of a cylinder over a 60-minute time frame. The vulnerable zone would be <0.1 miles with no affected population based on the 2000 census block data.\n\nMitigation and administrative controls in place for the facility provide for the safe use of one ton chlorine cylinders in accordance with the standard operating procedures as established by the Pinellas County Waste to Energy facility.\n\n(d) The general accidental release provention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nRESPONSE: The general accidental release prevention and the chemical specific prevention steps include:\n1. Conformance with the safety procedures established for chlorine use at a site including compliance with the OSHA 1910.119, Process Safety Management regulation.\n2. Training all affected personnel on the safe use of chlorine.\n3. Inspection of chlorine cylinders as they are received and installed into the system; daily visual inspections of the chlorine c"
