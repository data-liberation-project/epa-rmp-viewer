These 4 core values support our Safety and Health philosophy and management efforts. Interpersonal communications, problem solving, planning and safety achievement have a direct relationship with the core values when applied to safety training, hazard assessment/investigation, post-accident/incident recovery and generating solutions to potential risk exposures. U.S. Venture integrates Safety expectations as a part of Manager/Supervisors' responsibilities in order to create a meaningful daily presence during all work activity. All departments at the corporate level including Risk Management, Legal, Human Resources, Finance and Operations reinforce strategic safety planning and solid operation level decision-making that will reduce risk exposures.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Oil Milwaukee Jones Island Terminal is located on a 10.89-acre site on Jones Island/Port of Milwaukee in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Canola Oil, Biodiesel and Denatured Ethanol is received by rail and truck, stored at the terminal in various tanks with capacities ranging from 20,000 to 3.3 million gallons, and shipped out by truck or rail. The terminal is served by two different railroads with tracks running on both the east and west sides of the terminal.  In addition, the terminal stores butane or propane supplied by railcars in two 30,000 gallon pressure vessels that is ultimately shipped out via truck.  The quantity of butane or propane that is stored onsite exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility"

      "SummaryText": "to RMP requirements. NOTE: Currently, butane and propane processes cannot coexist at the facility.  The butane process is prevalent during September-April while propane prevalent in May-August.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Oil Milwaukee Jones Island Terminal's regulated butane and propane process complies with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) #58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas(LPG) Storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes including the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services LPG System requirements, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, and DOT's Hazardous Materials regulations.  The City of Milwaukee has approved the installation of the system.  If a fire emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Milwaukee Fire Department by calling 911, which may trigger involvement by Milwaukee County Emergency Management or Wisconsin Emergency Management, as necessary.  All personnel at this facility are 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual refresher hazardous materials training.\r\n\r\nU.S. Oil has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving butane or propane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release of butane or propane at the U.S. Oil Milwaukee Jones Island Terminal, Terminal Emergency Response Personnel have been trained to immediately activate an emergency shutdown device (ESD) at one of five locations depending on location of the release and is the policy of the terminal to initially contact the Milwaukee Fire Department and request their assistance (via 911).  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Milwaukee Fire Department and Hazmat Team along with Milwaukee County Emergency Management.\r\n\r\nWhen an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged, CEC (Terminal Security Company) will be notified and"

      "SummaryText": "a representative will call the terminal phone in response to confirm whether there is an actual emergency.  If there is no answer at the terminal to confirm whether help is needed, CEC will contact the terminal's on-call number.  CEC will continue calling terminal associates until they are able to speak with somebody in person to communicate the situation (they will not leave a voice message).\r\n\r\nPrior to startup of the regulated process, management from the U.S. Oil Jones Island Terminal conducted face to face to meetings with all Port of Milwaukee Tenants which included educating the tenants on the hazards of butane, evacuation plans, and assembly points.  In addition, the Terminal has internally implemented a web based notification system to enhance internal and external communication in the event of an emergency.  During an emergency, the notification system can be used to communicate critical information including security threats, fires, and chemical releases to the Port of Milwaukee tenants, the Milwaukee Fire Department and Hazmat Team, Milwaukee County Emergency Management, etc.\r\n\r\nThe notification system is capable of reaching out to people in minutes.  During an emergency situation, facility trained personnel can send out a notification from the web or a mobile device.  Notifications can be received via email, text, and/or phone depending on each individual preference. Individuals can sign up for any of the notification options when they sign a consent form giving U.S. Oil permission to place them in the system. \r\n\r\nThe notification system has been tested with Port of Milwaukee Tenants, Milwaukee Fire and Hazmat, and Milwaukee County Emergency Management.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety include installing isolation valves (needle valves)on the tank liquid and vapor internal valves in addition to each side of ball cone check valves (also used for pressure relief) for easy isolation and maintenance."
