The worst case release scenario is defined by EPA as a chemical  release of the maximum quantity in the largest vessel released in a 10 minute period, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint' selected by EPA under the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2.   The defined endpoint used for chlorine was the ERPG2 concentration of 3 PPM chlorine.  The Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG2) is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.   The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint has to be defined to estimate the population potentially effected.\n\nFor the processes of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia at the HRWTP, distances to the toxic endpoints are concentric, with liquid chlorine release having the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint.  Therefore, a chlorine release was modeled for the worst case scenario.  The worst case release scenario for a chlorine release at HRWTP would be the instantaneous release of one full railcar in a ten minute period.  The amount of chlorine released would be 180,000 pounds.  Release conditions are defined in the RMP rule to be an atmospheric stability factor F, wind speed @ 1.5 m/s, and a roughness coefficient set for urban.  Mitigation for an enclosed building considered to be accessed at 55% of the released quantity.  Under this condition a mitigated release quantity would be 99,000 pounds of chlorine."

      "SummaryText": "For the ten minute release period the release rate would be 9,900 pounds per minute.  EPA's RMP*Comp dispersion program was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario.  The area of concern distance radius to the ERPG2 endpoint is 9.9 miles.\n\nAn alternative release scenario was developed for both chlorine and ammonia at HRWTP. \n\nLiquid chlorine is transferred from the railcar in service to the chlorine evaporator thru a 1 inch diameter pipe.  A rupture of the transfer piping will create a flashing liquid chlorine release.   The release rate for flashing liquid releases for chlorine as referenced in EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants;  EPA 550-B-98-010, equation (8), page 4-22 as:  QR= 3,140 X Ah.\n\nQR= Release rate in pounds per minute\nAh= Hole or puncture area (sq in)= 3.1416 x (12)/4 = 0.79 sq in.\n\nQR = 3,140 x 0.79 = 2,481 #/min.\n\nRelease conditions are set at default conditions for the RMP rule.  These are  ambient temperature default at 25 degC, atmospheric stability factor D, wind speed @ 3.0 m/s,  roughness coefficient set for urban.  Mitigation for enclosed building considered at 55% of the release quantity would yield a release rate of  1,364 #/min .  Utilizing EPA's RMP*Comp modeling program the distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative chlorine release scenario is 0.6 miles.                                                                                              Note: For the alternative release explained above to occur, a failure of the rail car excess flow check valve would also have to occur.  The excess flow check valve of  the chlorine rail car is designed to prevent flow of liquid chlorine from the rail car is excess of 250 pounds per minute.  If a piping rupture as described above were to occur, the excess flow check valve on the chlorine car angle valve feeding liquid chlorine from the rail car would shutdown flow when a flow rate of 250 pounds per minute was reached.

      "SummaryText": "n the case described above this would occur within the first 15 seconds of a pipe rupture significantly reducing the release of chlorine from the rail car.  The excess flow valve would remain closed until sufficient pressure was restored to the feed line.  This would not occur until the feed line was repaired.  Under this alternate case release scenario, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.2 miles as computed by RMP*Comp ver 1.06. \n\nFor anhydrous ammonia the alternative case release scenario involves the rupture of a 2 inch diameter stainless steel transfer piping carrying ammonia gas.  As summarized in section 8.1 of the OCA Guidance manual, the release rate can be estimated by the following equation.\n\nQR= HA x  Pt x GF  /  (Tt)**0.5  = 254.7 #/min.\n        \n\nQR= Release rate in pounds per minute\nHA= Hole or puncture area (sq in)= 3.1416 x (2**2)/4 = 3.14 sq in\nPt=   Tank Pressure (psia) = 100 psia for ammonia vapor pressure @ 25 degC\nTt=   Tank Temperature in degK = 273 + degC= 273 + 25= 298\nGF= Gas factor as indicated from Exhibit B-1, Appendix B of OCA Guidance manual= 14 for                 anhydrous ammonia.\n\nUtilizing EPA's RMP*Comp modeling program the distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative ammonia release scenario is 0.2 miles, to a ERPG-2 toxic endpoint concentration of 200 ppm.  There are currently no passive mitigation systems in place for anhydrous ammonia.  However, ammonia leak detectors are being tested to enhance operator response time to an ammonia leak situation.\n\nd.

The City of Tampa Water Department (TWD) accidental release policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable federal and state prevention program guidelines are adhered to.  The TWD emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  Emergency response plans include coordination with the local fire departments and COT emergency response units.\n\n\nb.  The HRWTP is a surface water treatment facility producing potable water from the Hillsborough River is Tampa, Florida, utilizing an enhanced coagulation treatment process. HRWTP maintains an inventory of liquid chlorine in two 90 ton rail cars located within an enclosed chemical building.  Chlorine is used as the primary disinfectant in the potable water treatment process.  Secondary disinfection for potable water storage and distribution is achieved with chloramine, a combination chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.    Anhydrous ammonia is stored in two 2000 gallon horizontal pressurized tanks. .  Anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are filled only to 85% capacity as required under manufacturer specifications.  Each tank has a maximum weight storage capacity of 9,675 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The treatment facility is currently manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  The HRWTP has been designed for the safe storage and handling of chlorine and ammonia as referenced in the Combined Process Safety Management Program for the City of Tampa Water Department, Production Division.  These are the only chemicals used in a process at this facility covered by the RMP rule.\n\n\nc.
