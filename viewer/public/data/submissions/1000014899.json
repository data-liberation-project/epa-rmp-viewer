If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Washington Fire Department as well as the Wilkes County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Wilkes County Emergency Medical Service and Wills Memorial Hospital.  THis facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.  On-site personnel consist of truck transport drivers during off loading activities and period Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC representatives.\n\nThe Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC - Washinton Terminal is a butane transfer facility (specifically, rail car to trauck transfer tanker).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane transfer systems only, including the associated piping and eight (8) 30,000 - gallon storage tanks (railcars).  This is the maximum capacity of the railspur.  \n\nThis facility's worst case scenario is the catastrophic failure of one (1) 30,000 - gallon storage tank car when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate (most likely what could effect offsite receptors) scenario is a transloader \"pull away\" accident resulting in a one minute pipe/hose release from two (2) rail and one (1) truck connections and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends to 0.01 miles but does not effect public or environmental receptors.  THis scenario was selected based on the potential to impact receptors offsite (largest quantity released) that does not involve the failure (complete release) of the railcar.\n\nThe Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC Washinton Terminal"

This butane transfer system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 as the manufacturers (Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC) instructions.\n\nTo date, this facility has never had as accident involving butane (approximately three (3) years old) which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property / environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in-place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC - Washington Terminal's butane transfer system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Washington Fire Department and request their assistance.  The facility currently has no trained brigade or hazardous materials response team.  The facility emergency response plans are coordianted with the fire department and the Wilkes LEPC.  The Washington Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP / PSM training session for this system.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe Facility has completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and subsequent updates/revalidations for this process and has developed an action plan for consideration (est. April of 2010).\n\nImprovement actions to be considered primarily focus on site security measures including improved monitoring and inspection access.  Other considerations include improvements to minimize off-site migration of butane in the event of a release especially in the A?coldA? season.\n\n"
