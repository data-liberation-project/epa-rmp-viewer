      "SummaryText": "     1.   Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n          The City of Ukiah uses chlorine gas to disinfect the potable water it produces for the\n     protection of this community and to meet state health codes and EPA guidelines for the\n     protection of the distribution system. \n          Being aware of this, the city has prepared an extensive training program, in both safety\n     and first aid, for those employees that have to manage and handle chlorine.   They also\n     demanded certain safety equipment to be considered and implemented in the construction\n     of the water treatment plant.\n          They have educated the police and fire departments  about emergency procedures in case\n     of an accidental release.  These procedures further protect the community which we serve\n     and in which we live.\n\n     2.   The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n          The primary purpose of the City of Ukiah, Public Utilities Department's, Water Division,\n     is to provide to the community an adequate, safe, and healthy supply of water.  The\n     primary source of water to the community comes from the water treatment located\n          behind the men's softball fields east of highway 101.  The treatment plant receives chlorine\n     in one ton containers that are approved for use by the Chlorine Institute.  These\n     containers have been inspected and hydrostatically tested before shipment and visually\n     inspected again upon receipt at the plant.  These cylinders contain liquid chlorine under\n     pressure.\n          The properties of chlorine that make it an effective disinfectant against the microbes that\n     are present in our source water also makes it dangerous to humans in higher\n     concentrations.  Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas that is two an one-half times heavier\n     than air, has a pungent odor, and is toxic to humans above 10 ppm (parts per million).  It\n     will increase in volume from liquid to gas app"

When it combines\n     with moisture it creates both hydrochloric acid, HCl, and hypochlorous acid, HOCl, both\n     of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause severe respiratory and ocular damage.\n          The chlorine storage area is a secure area within the plant grounds and the total maximum\n     amount at the plant is 4000 pounds.\n\n     3.   The worst case scenario and alternative release scenario\n\n          The worst case scenario that has been developed for the City of Ukiah water treatment\n     plant uses the premise that there are no safety factors involved.  It is assumed that the\n     wind is blowing at 4.5 mph and that the temperature is 77E.  The scenario further states\n     that all 2000 pounds of one container would convert from liquid to gas and disperse within\n     ten minutes from within an enclosed room.  The results of this model determine that the\n     chlorine gas would have to travel 1.3 miles in the direction of the wind in order to be\n     reduced to 3 ppm.  Depending on the wind direction this would affect all of Ukiah proper\n     going as far south as Talmage Rd. and as far north as Ackerman Cr.  The cemetery to the west       and to the east dispersion would be limited by the foothills.  This, again depending on the\n     direction of the wind, would involve all of the schools, all hospitals, juvenile hall, all\n      commercial and industrial sites, all parks, all day care centers, and all residences down\n     wind from the treatment plant.\n\n          The alternative release scenario takes into account that there are safety features designed\n     into the plant and the fact that the most likely leak that may occur would release less than\n     twenty-one ponds per minute for less than fifteen minutes.\n          The system in use at the treatment plant is a pressure/vacuum system and the pressure\n     portion involves the cylinder, valve, and less than four inches from the chlorine cylinder to\n     a vacuum regulato"

      "SummaryText": "r.  The vacuum side is approximately seven feet and is controlled by the\n     vacuum regulator.  This means that if a vacuum is not being applied the vacuum regulator\n     is closed and there is no gas flow.  If the vacuum regulator were to fail the vacuum side of\n     the system would then be pressurized and the flow would be equivalent to the degree of\n     failure.  The plant has installed, two chlorine gas detectors that have battery backup. \n     These detectors are set to alarm at 1-3 ppm.  When they alarm several items automatically\n     come into play.  The first is the chlorine scrubber which is a chemical neutralization\n     process specifically for chlorine.  This draws the heavy gas into a tank engineered to mix\n     the chlorine gas with the contents.  Thus no gas will escape to the atmosphere.  The\n     second item that happens simultaneously with the first is an audible and visual alarm\n     indication and the water supply to the injectors is closed.  The third item is that after one\n     minute our phone system automatically calls the City of Ukiah dispatch center and they in\n     turn dispatch first the fire department and then the necessary plant personnel to investigate\n     the cause of the alarm.  The fourth item is the computer at the plant will shut down the\n     plant and eliminate any further draw of chlorine other than the leak.  \n          With all of these factors involved during a minute leak, the incident and any effect will be\n     isolated to the enclosed space and there will be no off site impact.\nAt well 5 there aren=t any safety factors currently in place except for the fact it is in an        enclosed room.  With a twenty-one pound per minute release the duration with a 150 pound           cylinder would be just over seven minutes long.  With no alarms the entire contents would be           lost. The release would be minimal and would cover approximately one-tenth of a mile, and           would not affect any residences, recreatio"

The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n     \n          The City of Ukiah water treatment plant is actively involved in several regulatory\n     mandates when it comes to handling and using chlorine gas.  These are OSHA Reg 29\n     CFR 1910.38, EPA CFR 40, OSHA PSM, STATE HEALTH and SAFETY CODE\n     2735, and the STATE EPCRA.\n          The OSHA Reg CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan sets specific guidelines on training\n     in safety and maintenance prior to an emergency and if an emergency might occur.\n     The OSHA PSM (process safety management) covers nearly identical features.\n      The State Health and Safety Code 2735 covers air quality.\n          The State EPCRA is the Emergency Planning Community Right-to-know Act and sets\n     guidelines for the notification of the community in the event of a release above a pre-\n     determined amount.\n     The EPA CFR 40 is the Federal Clean Air Act. \n          The city is acutely aware of the importance of safety meetings, safety training,\n     maintenance training for its employees, and the community's right to know about the\n     situations which could cause impairment or death.  As such we at the treatment plant are\n     even more aware because the water which we deliver to the community has to be healthy\n     and the products we use to achieve this can also cause illness if not handled carefully and\n     if the safety parameters are not kept under close scrutiny.  As water treatment specialist\n     we receive many technical publications and journals that outline changes in procedure and\n     new products on the market for enhancing our water or for monito"
