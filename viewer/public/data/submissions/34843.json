The propane storage/handling process consists of one 30,000-gallon propane AST, propane cylinder filling equipment, filled propane cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a medium pressure acetylene generator and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  The acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.

The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe Linde Gas facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and "
