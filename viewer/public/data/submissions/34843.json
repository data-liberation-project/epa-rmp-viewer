The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nThe Linde Gas, LLC facility located in Hammond, Indiana complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane or acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Hammond Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  In addition, each employee is trained monthly on safety policies and procedures.  Employees also participate in Quarterly Safety Committee meetings for the facility.  Hazards identified during the meetings are corrected accordingly.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe Linde Gas facility manufactures acetylene and stores propane and propylene in above ground storage tanks (ASTs).  All three gases are put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.  The propane storage/handling process consists of one 30,000-gallon propane AST, propane cylinder filling equipment, filled propane cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a medium pressure acetylene generator and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  The acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  The propylene stored and manufactured at the Hammond facility is less than the threshold limitation and therefore, is not considered a regulated substance.  \n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe Linde Gas facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and "

The propane and acetylene systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA and state law at the Linde Gas facility in Hammond, Indiana.  All leaks are immediately reported to supervision.  Prompt clean-up of accidental releases and investigation into root causes are conducted to make corrections and to prevent future occurances.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\nThe Linde Gas facility in Hammond, Indiana has not had any reportable accidents in the last five years. \n\n5.  The emergency response program:\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our propane or acetylene storage system, it is Linde Gas' policy to immediately notify the Hammond Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  We have communicated this policy with the Hammond Fire Department.  All employees have access to Linde Gas' emergency action plan and emergency action training is conducted annually.  Linde Gas also has an Emergency Response Team within one hour of the facility who responds to emergencies.  The responders carry a Technical level certification and are trained as required by OSHA 1910.120.  An ADT alarm system is installed in critical areas and a fire drill is performed each year with all employees.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:  \nPeriodic tours and training are available for firefighting staff which serve to better our relationship and involvement with Hammond Fire Department."
