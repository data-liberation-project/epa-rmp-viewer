If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to residents and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is wholesaling of grains, and the operation of country grain elevator.   Bruning Grain & Feed, Inc. has operated this facility for over 50 years.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at this location is 461,352 pounds including all nurse trailers as well as permanent fixed storage.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n    A..  The worst-case release scenario would be the total release of the anhydrous ammonia from our major storage tank.  We rely on EPA's RMP Comp to determine distances to end point, etc. and have maps, population estimates, etc. available to our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for their consideration and planning.\n\n     B.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  We have similar information for this type of release readily available to our LEPC. \n\n     C.  Administrative controls are through our operating procedures, training, maintenance, and audit programs.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program: The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  During periods of non operation  local law enforcement personnel and our personnel make unscheduled inspections of the facility.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour number and appropriate action is taken.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the past five years t"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Continued review of procedures and policies.\n\n8.  For additional information contact:\n\n     Tina Domeier\n     Bruning Grain & Feed Co., Inc.\n     P. O.
