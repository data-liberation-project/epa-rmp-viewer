As part of the Center\u00bfs operations, in mid-August 2001 the Center will bring on-line it\u00bfs closed loop refrigeration system using Anhydrous Ammonia as a heat removal media.\nThis type of process is extremely efficient and is commonly used.   Anhydrous Grade Ammonia serves as the most economically abundant and efficient heat transfer medium for industry refrigeration and heat reduction processes.  \n\nAs a result of a recognized highly toxic chemical that will be used at the Sheetz Distribution Center and in accordance with EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program, 40 CFR, Section 68 requirements.  The Center has developed and implemented prevention program # 3.  Additionally the Center has also in place a Process Safety Management program as required by OSHA Standard 1910.119.  \n\nThe facility modeled two off site consequence analyses.  The first was a worst-case scenario that consisted of a full release of Anhydrous Ammonia stored within a storage tank containing 8960 lbs. With and evaporation rate of 896 lbs. per minute with a toxic endpoint of 3.2 miles.  Within the 3.2 radius of the facility there is an estimated residence population of 3900, commercial industry, and two schools. There are no hospitals, prisons/correction facilities or environmental receptors.\n\nThe second analysis was an alternative release scenario that consisted of a rupture disk/relief valve failure.
