The prevention program has been prepared for ensuring: \n\n\n\n?    the protection of public health, the environment, and Preferred Freezer Services of Norton employees by ensuring safe operation and maintenance practices that follow industry standards and meet recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices\n\n\n\n?    proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\n\n\n\n?    Preferred Freezer Services of Norton and local government agencies are together in their communication and coordination efforts to improve safety while handling regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe content of the risk management program is implemented in conjunction with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), process safety program PSM 1910.119 and addresses Preferred Freezer Services of Norton administrative and operational programs to prevent accidents related to regulated substances and to reduce potential risks. The chemical Anhydrous Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration for warehouse cold/freezer storage, and dock operations. Ammonia is dangerous in high concentration, but has a self alarming odor at very low concentrations making it easy to identify when a leak is small. Anhydrous ammonia is a natural refrigerant that's environmentally friendly and does not cause harm to the ozone layer.\n\n\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nPreferred Freezer Services of Norton operates an industrial refrigeration system that contains Anhydrous Ammonia. The refrigeration system is located in the main building.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle is a closed-loop process. The refrigeration cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat of vaporization to remove heat from a desired area, and then to discard that heat, through conde"

The plan allowing for this participation must be documented. Employees and their representatives must have access to all information required to be developed for the Process Safety Management program without regard to possible trade secret status of such information.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nComplete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM program and to other aspects such as the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The information to be compiled about the chemicals needs to be comprehensive enough for an accurate assessment of the fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity hazards, the health and safety hazards to workers, and the corrosion effects on process equipment as well as monitoring and safety related equipment. Safety Data Sheet (SDS) information can provide a portion of the required data but other information will be required.\n\n\n\nProcess technology information is also required. This includes information on the amount of hazardous material stored and used at the facility as well as operating limits for the process. Diagrams of the system and information on all of the equipment utilized in the system are required. Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are included in the Process Safety Information.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is the basis for many of the decisions and procedures associated with an effective PSM program. It is a systematic effort to determine the potential hazards associated with the process and to evaluate mitigation alternatives including equipment modifications, procedural modifications, training, and administrative controls. An effective PHA considers and analyzes the potenti"

It focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external events.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that both operator safety as well as off-site safety is addressed, \"What-If/Checklist\" analysis is conducted during the PHA session. Siting issues and Human factors to assess such as lighting, accessibility, and overall working conditions were incorporated in the analysis. \n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOperating procedures describe operating conditions to be maintained, and safety and health precautions to be utilized in operation of the process containing regulated substances. The procedures need to be technically accurate and will result in safe operation of the facility. In addition, they need to be understandable to the employees and/or contractors. The procedures are updated as changes are made to the facility or to the operating limits of the system. The employer annually certifies that the operating procedures are current and accurate.\n\n\n\nAll phases of system operation must be covered by written procedures. Specifically, procedures must be available for:\n\n\n\n?    Initial Startup\n\n?    Normal Operations\n\n?    Temporary Operations\n\n?    Emergency Shut Down\n\n?    Emergency Operations\n\n?    Normal Shutdown\n\n?    Start Up Following an Emergency Shut Down or turn around following maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe procedures contain process operation limits and provide information of the consequences of deviation from these limits and the steps required to correct any deviations. Safety and health measures described in the SDS are referenced to warn employees of potential risks and protective action that should be taken.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE TRAINING\n\nAll employees, including maintenance and contractor employees involved with regulated substances (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), need to fully understand the health and safety hazards associated with the chemical with which they are w"

In addition to the normal awareness training, which informs personnel of the hazards of the chemical and the safety precautions to use, training in operating procedures and safe work practices, emergency response, and other required management controls are required at the Preferred Freezer Services of Norton facility.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTOR SAFETY\n\nAny use of outside contractors who work in and around the refrigeration system requires that these contractors have accomplished the training, utilize proficient personnel, and have been informed of the necessary health and safety aspects of working in the area. The goal is to assure that contractor employees perform work in a safe manner and do not endanger themselves, other employees, or the facility. \n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nFor a new design or the addition of significant changes to the process, a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) must be employed to determine that the changes are not themselves deficient or that the addition of the new portions of the system will adversely affect the original system. Management procedures are developed to ensure that a satisfactory hazard analysis has been completed before the system is started.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nA formal maintenance program is in place for all systems using regulated substances (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia). This program will consist of routine (scheduled) inspection, testing, overhaul, and replacement as needed. Equipment is categorized and ranked with respect to the maintenance involved. This maintenance and inspection information includes all equipment such as storage vessels, compressors, condensers, evaporators, process piping relief and vent systems, fire protection system components, emergency shutdown systems, and alarms.

This program will advise the personnel that significant potential hazards exist and that extra care should be taken in certain circumstances. This will ensure that employees, contractors, and company property are protected against fire, explosion, and other dangers resulting from hot work.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nOther than \"replacement in kind,\" any change to the system is documented. In particular, the change of any equipment, control system, or procedure must be evaluated to determine that it will not have an adverse effect on the safety aspects of the system. In addition, procedures must be revised to reflect the changes in the system.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nIncident investigation is the process of identifying the underlying causes of incidents and implementing steps to prevent similar events from occurring. It is required that employees will recognize and investigate events that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a hazardous chemical release. Employers must develop in-house capabilities to investigate incidents that occur in their facilities. A team must be assembled by this facility and trained to collect and document information related to any incident. Usually a multi-disciplinary team is better able to gather the facts and evaluate \"what happened and why.\" All employees with information should be interviewed and other facts should be gathered to develop a complete picture of the facts concerning the incident. Recommendations are then developed for changes in equipment,"
