This investigation must identify the chain of events and causes of the incident and include corrective measures that can be developed and implemented.  A team must perform the investigation with at least one person knowledgeable in the process and others who have appropriate knowledge and experience; a representative of the contractor or the chemical supplier must also be part of the team if either were involved in the incident.

The Risk Management Program rule was issued and is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rule, Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) Provisions (Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)), applies to a wide variety of facilities that handle, manufacture, store or use toxic and/or highly flammable substances.\r\nAgri-Mark stores 19,560 pounds of ammonia at their manufacturing facility on 869 Exchange Street in Middlebury, Vermont.  Agri-Mark is required to address the requirements of the CAP regulations because they exceed the 10,000 pound ammonia threshold. \r\nAgri-Mark owns and operates the Middlebury facility, which produces cheese and other dairy related products.  The purpose of the ammonia is as a heat transfer medium for the facility's refrigeration system.\r\nAgri-Mark is also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The State of Vermont has been delegated authority for OSHA compliance.  There are also a number of other chemicals used at the facility, which are addressed in Agri-Mark's EMERGENCY RESPONSE Plan.\r\nThe Risk Management Plan contains the policies and procedures used at Agri-Mark to assure continued compliance with the EPA CAP and OSHA PSM regulations.  Most of the documents that are part of the Risk Management Plan follow a standard format that includes the purpose, organization, responsibilities and authorities, as well as general step-by-step instructions.  Section references are shown throughout this document in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS for reference purposes.\r\nMost procedures contain information on document"

The manual is available for review by employees at the facility with the exception of specific off site consequence analysis data.  Recommendations to improve the plan's accuracy or effectiveness in assuring employee, visitor and contractor safety can be directed to the Risk Management Plan Coordinator.\r\nThe goal of the Risk Management Plan is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) required EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment.\r\nThe phrase Risk Management Program refers to the requirements of Part 68, which must be implemented on an on-going basis. The phrase Risk Management Plan refers to this document as well as the registration information submitted to EPA.\r\nCovered facilities must develop and implement a Risk Management Plan and maintain documentation required by the plan on site.  The Risk Management Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.\r\nCovered facilities must also submit registration information (RMP Submit) to EPA no later than June 21, 1999 or the date on which the facility first has more than a threshold quantity in use or stored at the site, whichever is later.  Covered facilities are required to re-submit their Risk Management Plans every five years.  The RMP Submit provides an electronic summary of"
