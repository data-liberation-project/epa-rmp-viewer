Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of the P&O Cold Logistics facility located in Tracy, California (P&O -Tracy) to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  P&O - Tracy implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nP&O - Tracy is located at 800 East Pescadero Avenue in Tracy, California.  The facility is situated approximately ? mile south of the I-205 Freeway.  There have been numerous owners of the facility since operations began in 1990, with P&O Cold Logistics assuming ownership in Fall 2003.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is commercial.\n\nThe primary business of P&O - Tracy is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 18,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler/freezer storage, and glycol underfloor hea"

Typical operating conditions range from 0 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 130 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\nNOTE:  AT THE TIME OF THIS SUBMITTAL (MAY 2004), THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM WAS NOT IN OPERATION.  THEREFORE THE SYSTEM PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES ARE CURRENTLY AT AMBIENT CONDITIONS. THERE ARE NOT IMMEDIATE PLANS TO RETURN THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM TO FULL OPERATING MODE.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following regulations that promote the safe handling of certain chemicals including ammonia:\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n3)  California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by P&O - Tracy to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that P&O - Tracy's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take "

      "SummaryText": "specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will alarm at 150 ppm and cease the supply of liquid ammonia to the area of the warehouse in which the detection occurred.  This prevents the quantity release from escalating.  An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release during off-hours, the off-site alarm company will notify the P&O -Tracy Chief Engineer.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased upon the accident history of the facility reported in the Off-site Consequence Analysis (April 2004), there have been no reportable releases of ammonia at P&O - Tracy over the past five years (April 1999 - April 2004.)\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n? save lives;\n? minimize and avoid injuries;\n? protect the environment; and\n? minimize property damage.\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  The Chief Engineer will immediately alert professional emergency responders (i.e. fire department/ hazardous materials team) in case of an uncontrolled release.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at lea"

Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPrior to the system being filled with ammonia, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA of the refrigeration system consisted of a:\n\n? Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n? series of safety checklists; and\n? facility inspection.\n\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and reviewing emergency response issues including wind sock locations, posting of maps, and conducting drills with facility personnel following startup."
