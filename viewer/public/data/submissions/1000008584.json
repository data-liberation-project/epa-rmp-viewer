This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass potato cold storage.  We have one regulated substances present at our facility: anhydrous ammonia used for cold storage refrigeration.  \nThis is a Program Level 3 Risk Management Plan.  \n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP *Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n \nThe worst case:\n\nThe worst case scenario for this site involves the total catastrophic release of the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia receiver tank due to vehicular collision.  Under this scenario, a total of 18000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in liquid form are assumed to be released over a period of ten minutes.  A toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l is expected to cover a radius of 2.6 miles, encompassing a population of 113 persons.  No active mitigation measures were considered in this scenario.  Atmospheric conditions are: Air Temperature: 77 degrees F; Stability Class: F; and Wind Speed: 1.5 m/s.\n\nAlternative Scenarios \n\nAn alternative scenario is a release of anhydrous ammonia gas due to a leak in the process piping.  The release is assumed to"

Under this scenario, the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l encompasses a four-tenths mile radius, containing two inhabitants.  Atmospheric conditions for this scenario are: Stability Class: D; Wind Speed: 3m/s; and Air Temperature of 77-degrees F.\n\nA second alternative scenario is a release of anhydrous ammonia gas due to a leak in a vessel containing liquid ammonia.  The release is assumed to be at a rate of 100 pounds per minute over a thirty minute period for a total release of 3000 pounds.  Under this scenario, the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l encompasses a two-tenths mile radius, containing zero inhabitants.  Atmospheric conditions for this scenario are: Stability Class: D; Wind Speed: 3m/s; and Air Temperature of 77-degrees F.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis is a relatively new facility that was designed and constructed in accordance with ASTM standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our cold storage facility.\n\nSafety Information:\n\nVignolo Farms, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Review:\n\nOur facility has conducted comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and ammonia refrigeration operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of every five years or whenever major changes in the process are proposed.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis will be addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent review of hazards was performed on \n12/13/2007.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely co"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining:\n\nVignolo Farms, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the refrigeration system process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMaintenance Program:\n\nVignolo Farms, Inc. carries out routine maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nVignolo Farms, Inc. conducts compliance audits at least once every three years to ensure the ongoing safety of our facility and the community.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nVignolo Farms, Inc. will promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  Such investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports of incidents will be"
