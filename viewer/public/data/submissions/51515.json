PPG also follows the Responsible Care? Codes of Management Practice, including the Responsible Care? Community Awareness Code of Management Practice, and PPG's own Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Policy to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG's CAER Policy requires each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.  All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, whose goal is \"to manufacture, sell, and distribute products worldwide in a manner that is safe and protective of our employees, neighbors, customers, other stakeholders, and the environment.\"\n\nRegulated substances handled:\nPPG's Lake Charles facility is part of the ChlorAlkali & Derivatives Strategic Business Unit of PPG Industries, Inc.  The facility is a fully integrated process that produces chlorine, caustic soda, silica products and various chlorinated hydrocarbons.  These chemicals are utilized in many areas such as water treatment, food processing, medicines, plastics and Freon substitutes.   Chlorine, ethyl chloride, vinyl chloride and ammonia are manufactured or stored in quantities that meet EPA Risk Management Program threshold values.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\nPersonnel, environmental, health and safety measures are included in all phases"

These standards may include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, flammable and toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, a fire water system, computer controls for the processes and a procedure to systematically analyze potential hazards in each new process.  \n\nEmployees at the facility receive job-appropriate training. The training program includes periodic retraining, as appropriate.  \n\nSafety, environmental, operating and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates.  Additional systems are in place to review proposed changes and assure that any new training requirements are met.  Another system assures a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit on a prescribed frequency.  All of the training and updating procedures are monitored. \n\nPPG's Lake Charles facility has an array of maintenance and inspection programs that minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures.  Periodic equipment inspections are performed to assure the equipment integrity. The inspections utilize recognized codes and procedures that are followed by specially trained individuals. Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized and can include vibration monitoring, infrared imaging, inspections by independent experts, inspections by insurance specialists and root-cause analysis investigations. Piping systems are inspected and tested with X-rays and hydrostatic tests prior to operation. The piping is monitored by a variety of methods to assure its condition.  Maintenance personnel are included in many of the training and testing programs that the operators utilize.  Additional training and procedures have been developed for activities that are specific to maintenance.  \n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nAn accidental release of chlorine occurred on March 27, 2003.
