      "SummaryText": "We take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency action procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nOur refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29CFR1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40CFR68) our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nAn emergency action program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures and instructions for contacting outside responders for assistance. The program has been coordinated with local first responder officials. A copy of the site\u0092s emergency plans has been sent to the appropriate LEPC. In the event of an off-site release, County Emergency Management will provide for warning and evacuation / shelter-in-place for the general public.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThrough our PSM/RMP program, we are continuously looking for possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in our facility."

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nLone Star Bakery, Plant No. 2, located in China Grove, Texas, uses anhydrous ammonia as a cooling medium for frozen cakes, pies, and other baked goods.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop refrigeration system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation; however, because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.\n\nLone Star Bakery's senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program promoting a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Lone Star Bakery administers safety and environmental policies to ensure compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, and an Emergency Action Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nLone Star Bakery is located at 8100 Highway 87 East, China Grove, Texas 78263.  The ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe system uses 38,000 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for frozen cakes, pies, and other baked goods.  The majority of the system including vessels and compressors is located within facility machinery room.  The condensers and main receiver are located outside the machinery room and all of the evaporators are located in their respective freezer/cold storage areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS"
