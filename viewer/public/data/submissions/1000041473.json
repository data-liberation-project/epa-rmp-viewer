Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the WESTSIDE FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is received into St. Albans in 180,000 pound railcars.  This product is then repackaged in different  containers for distribution to customers and in the manufacture of Sodium Hypochlorite.  Sulfur Dioxide is received prepackaged in different  containers.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are used for resell to our customers.\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996.  Our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety In"
