(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Columbus, OH.  The facility is located on Watkins Road. The resin facility consists of a plant that was originally constructed in 1970.  Overall, the facility employs 42 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Columbus Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Columbus Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP Plan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Columbus Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the Columbus Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Columbus Plant consists of the following four elements:\n\n? a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n? a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n \n? an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\n? a risk management system that assigns responsibility for specific elements of the RMP pr"

In fact, the Columbus Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place with many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Columbus Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Columbus Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at Columbus Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Columbus Plant; and programs "

GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities are coordinated with the LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system, headed by the Plant manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 Regulated Substances\n\nThe Columbus Plant handles only formaldehyde water solution in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program Level 3 processes at the plant.\n\n Regulated Substance    Process    Process Quantity*, lbs    RMP Threshold, lbs*\nFormaldehyde Solution (50% water)    Storage in Unpressurized Tanks    121,824    15,000\n            \nFormaldehyde Solution (50% water)    Resin Manufacturing    55,836    15,000\n\n* Process and threshold quantity is the quantity of \"pure\" chemical, not of the water solution\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the \"worst-case\" and \"alternative release\" scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n\n? one \"worst-case release scenario\" for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n \n? one \"alternative release scenario\" for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n\nThe Columbus Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario.\"  The \"worst-case scenario,\" as described above, has never occurred, and GPRI does not expect a \"worst case release\" scenario described in the of"

An \"alternative release scenario\" represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Columbus Plant and (2) would result in the relative greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\n \nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Columbus Plant:\n\n1.3.1 Program 3 Processes-Toxic Substances - Formaldehyde/Water Solutions\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for a 50% water solution of formaldehyde is the release of the entire contents of 25,380 gallons formaldehyde/water solution (or 121,824  lbs of pure formaldehyde) from a formaldehyde material storage tank.  A concrete diked area contains the released formaldehyde solution which evaporates and forms a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the \"toxic endpoint concentration\" based on modeling is 0.44 mile.  The residential population potentially affected within this distance from the plant is approximately 78 people.  The public receptors located within this distance include nearby residences and industries.  No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\nThe \"alternative case release scenario\" for a 50% water solution of formaldehyde is the overfilling of a formaldehyde material storage tank and the release of 100 gallons formaldehyde/water solution (or 480 lbs of pure formaldehyde) into the concrete diked area.  Modeling this scenario indicates a \"toxic endpoint\" distance of 0.1 mile. The residential population potentially affected within this distance from the plant is 0 people.

Beginning in 1992, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established levels of prevention requirements.  The Columbus Plant is subject to Program 3 which is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Columbus Plant's Program 3 prevention program that address EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Columbus Plant's Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.4.1.1 Process Safety Information- the Columbus Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  GPRI ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees, the LEPC, and the Columbus Fire Department.\n \nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes.  The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\n\n? toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\n? physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\n? reactivity and corrosively data\n? thermal and chemical stability data \n? hazards of mixing substances in the process \n\nMSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the quality control lab (raw material MSDS's) and in the main office (product MSDS's) so that the operators have ready reference to this"

The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented. Reports are issued periodically to track progress of PHA findings/recommendations.  The PHA's are maintained at the Columbus Plant for the life of the process. \n \n1.4.1.3 Operating Procedures\n\nColumbus Plant operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n? steps for safely conducting activities\n? applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations and steps required to correct or avoid deviations\n? safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment     requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\n? quality control for raw materials and control of hazardous chemical inventory levels\n? safety systems and their functions\n\nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.

The plant trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team, with appropriate knowledge and experience, is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  The results are also reviewed with all affected employees and are maintained for at least five years.\n\n1.4.1.10 Employee Participation\n\nThe Columbus Plant has a written employee participation program for all covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of the plant's workers are addressed.  The plant encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the plant. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.\n\n1.4.1.11 Hot Work Permits\n\nThe Columbus Plant manages the  hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the plant.  The  Division Safety Department reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.

This review confirms that:\n\n? construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n? adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n? employee training has been completed\n? for a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new, or management of change     requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n \nA pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n1.4.1.8 Compliance Audit\n\nAt least every three years, the Columbus Plant audits covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of operations at the plant.  The plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP and PSM rules and in the process. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP and PSM rules and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropr"

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.  The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n1.4.2 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Columbus Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant.  The following paragraphs describe some of these features.\n\nFormaldehyde solution-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  The formaldehyde stored in the plant's storage vessels is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors or manufactured on-site. The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT--approved tank truck, and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde storage tank(s).  The storage tank(s) design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant. The storage tank(s) is surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the one of the single largest tanks should its entire contents be released.\n\n1.5  Five-Year Accident History\n\nAs defined by the RMP regulations, the Columbus Plant has documented a \"five year accident history\" that indicates one off-site release incident of toxic compounds in the last five years.\n\nTable 3- "

There were no accidental releases from the plant in the other four years being reported in this RMP that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nAs required by 40 CFR ?68.42, information about the September 10, 1997 accident is listed in Table 4 attached to this RMP.  The information contained in Table 4 is limited by the format requirements of the EPA's electronic submission which only allows for the input of numeric data and does not permit the Columbus Plant to explain or clarify the data reported.  The following summary provides necessary clarification and explanation for certain data in Table 4 which cannot be adequately reported by a single numeric entry.\n\nRelease Time and Chemicals Released:  The release occurred on September 10, 1997, beginning at approximately 10:40 a.m. and lasting approximately 23 seconds (in Table 4, the Release Duration is entered as 1 minute because that is the smallest increment of time that can be entered).  The release was verbally reported to the Ohio EPA Division of Emergency and Remedial Response (DEER) on September 10, 1997.  On September 11, 1997, the release was again verbally reported to OEPA, the LEPC, and the National Response Center with the initial estimate that 57,190 pounds of phenol were released. By letter dated September 16, 1997, the Columbus Plant notified the OEPA and the Franklin County LEPC that, upon further investigation, the actual amounts released were not more than "

By letters dated April 6, 1998, the Columbus Plant modified its earlier notice to the OEPA and Columbus LEPC and stated that \"[i]t has been estimated that only 233 pounds of partially polymerized material was not contained on-site.  The 233 pounds of material was comprised of approximately 153 pounds of phenol and 79 pounds of formaldehyde.\"  The April 6, 1998 revision was made based on physical observations and OEPA observations and notes.  The Columbus Plant is reviewing these prior notices to verify the information and, determine if any additional revisions should be made.\n\nOn February 15, 2000, the Columbus Plant notified the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, National Response Center and the Franklin County LEPC that, after further review and study, the best estimate of the amount of phenol released to the atmosphere was less than 1,100 pounds (gas), that the amount of formaldehyde released to the atmosphere was less than 250 pounds (gas), and that the amount of sulfuric acid that was released to the atmosphere was less than 70 pounds (gas).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Onsite Impacts: \n\nNumber of Injuries:  The number of onsite injuries, as defined by 40 CFR ?68.3, is reported as 8.  This number includes 4 emergency responders identified in the Critical Incident Report issued by the City of Columbus on November 11, 1997 (\"CIR\") as individuals who reportedly received medical treatment due to chemical exposure, however, the Columbus Plant has not verified that these emergency responders, in fact, had such exposure or received such medical treatment.\n\nOffsite Impacts:\n\nNumber of injuries; Number of Individuals Hos"

As explained in this paragraph, based upon information received to date, it is unknown, how many, if any, individuals were injured, hospitalized, or received other treatment, and therefore, the Columbus Plant has reported zero for each of these items.  The CIR states that there were no known reports of injured residents or residents taken to area hospitals.  The Columbus Plant has received claims for bodily injury which have not been adjusted either because the claimants are not represented by counsel and the Columbus Plant is therefore unable to adjust those claims because of the pending litigation or because the Columbus Plant has not received documentary support sufficient to verify the claimed injuries of the community members who are represented by counsel.  The Columbus Plant paid medical expenses for two individuals' minor medical treatment, but the Columbus Plant has not verified that the injuries were related to the accident.  Although the CIR lists eight residents who complained of symptoms at the time of the accident, the Columbus Plant has been unable to either verify the complaints or document that the identified residents required medical treatment. \n\nNumber of individuals evacuated: The total number of individuals evacuated is unknown and, therefore, the Columbus Plant reported zero for this item.  The CIR does not state the total number of individuals evacuated but reports that the Columbus Police Department evacuated three businesses, one school and approximately 12-15 homes along Watkins Road from New World to Alum Creek.  The evacuated businesses, school, and homes were all east of the Columbus Plant.\n\nProperty Damage:  Table 4 lists the amount of offsite property damage as  $87,016.10.

The Columbus Plant has received claims from four other community members who allege defoliation damage but the Columbus Plant has been unable to either verify these claims or document that there was, in fact, defoliation damage.\nIn addition to the foregoing, on May 6, 1998, a lawsuit was filed suit in state court in Columbus, Ohio by eight plaintiffs who seek to represent a class of individuals who, among other things, lived, worked, resided, owned, frequented, or otherwise allegedly occupied property located within a three mile radius of the Columbus Plant and allegedly suffered bodily injuries, property damage, and/or environmental damage as a result of the release on September 10, 1997.  The Columbus Plant has denied the material allegations of this lawsuit and the litigation is proceeding.\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\n\nThe Columbus Plant has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances and to protect public health and the environment. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the following:\n\n? informing the local emergency agencies, including the fire department, about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n\n? providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances at the plant\n \n? controlling and containing accidental release"
