      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Maplehurst Bakeries, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Brownsburg Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the production, storage and shipping of cakes, donuts and other bakery goods.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is 23265.90 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the Program 3 toxic substance as a class involves a catastrophic release from ammonia used as a refrigerant.  The scenario involves the release of 4662 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of .90 mil"

      "SummaryText": "es is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from a relief valve in the ammonia refrigeration process.  The scenario involves the release of 600 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is 0.10 miles.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nMaplehurst Bakeries maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe methodology used to carry out the analysis is What If-Checklist.  The analysis are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Maplehurst Bakeries maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information "

Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMaplehurst Bakeries carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and compressors.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a background in maintenance practices.  Training is provided to the personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Maplehurst Bakeries to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in the established process are conducted as a regular practice at Maplehurst Bakeries.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nMaplehurst Bakeries conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nMaplehurst Bakeries promptly investigates any i"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nMaplehurst Bakeries truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Maplehurst Bakeries has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all appilcable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nMaplehurst Bakeries has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nMaplehurst Bakeries has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
