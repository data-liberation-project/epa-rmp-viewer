The same properties that make these chemicals valuable for making drinking water safe also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of our chlorination system and ammonium hydroxide system to control human and environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding communities.  \n\nIt is Coastal Water Authority\u00bfs policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  The safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at CWA and we often exceed standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of these chemicals to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at CWA.  Senior management\u00bfs commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment. \n\nFacility Description and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Lynchburg pump station covers approximately 220 acres, including reservoirs.  It is located at 908 South Lynchburg Road, Houston, Texas in Harris County. Our facility treats a maximum of 315,000,000 gallons of water per day.\n\nThere is a maximum of twenty (20) full-time employees at the plant site at any one time. In addition, our plant has two residences located onsite.\n\nWe presently handle only two chemicals, which are considered toxic by the EPA."

Therefore they are included in our risk management program.  \n\n\u00bfAmmonium Hydroxide (CAS #7664-41-7) \u00bf This water treatment chemical is used in conjunction with chlorine to control biofouling within the CWA A, B and C systems.  It is received as a 25% by weight solution ammonia and water.  Deliveries are made by tanker truck to the facility where it is transferred to and stored in either of two atmospheric tanks onsite prior to use.  A concrete dike surrounds these tanks and the dike is designed to hold the contents of one tank in the event of a rupture.  The nameplate capacity of each tank is 18,000 gallons; however, administrative controls at the plant limit the capacity of the tanks to 15,000 gallons each.   The maximum amount of ammonia contained in the ammonium hydroxide solution and stored at the Lynchburg Pump Station is 56,750 pounds.  \n\n\u00bfChlorine (CAS7782-50-5) \u00bf This water treatment chemical is used in conjunction with ammonium hydroxide to control biofouling within the CWA A, B and C systems.

These containers are standard DOT and Chlorine Institute specified containers.  Deliveries of chlorine are made at the plant approximately biweekly.  The plant has a maximum inventory of 72,000 pounds of chlorine.  During normal operation, three containers (6,000 pounds maximum) are in service at any one time.  \n\nAccidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nCoastal Water Authority contracted with an outside engineering firm to assist in the development of a prevention program tailored exclusively to water treatment operations.
