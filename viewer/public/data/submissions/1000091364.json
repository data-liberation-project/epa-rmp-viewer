The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 26634 3200 East St., LaMoille, IL  61330, is the storage and distribution of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of (1) 30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized  facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 468,246 pounds; this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA'S Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state and codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of Title 8 Illinois Administrative Code 215: Anhydrous Ammonia, Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities, based upon the Compressed Gas Associations (CGA'S) \"American National Standard Safety Requirements or the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" (6th edition) , commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\", and the standards of the U.S. Occupational and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
