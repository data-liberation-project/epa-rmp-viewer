The programs are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required.  Our Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Contained in the Plan are written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the refinery.  These emergencies include: airborne releases of chemical substances, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions, personnel rescue incidents and medical emergencies.

No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified at the refinery. Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at Eagle Point Refinery.  The covered process at the refinery is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as NJDEP Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act program N.J.A.C. 7:31 (1-6) and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119.  The following summary addresses the combined elements of these three programs and describes the activities surrounding the implementation of each element. These programs constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\n1. Employee Participation\n\nThe Eagle Point Refinery involves employees in the programs developed to support process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees are included in every element of the program, from development, to active participation, to program updates.  They are members of the process hazard analysis (PHA) team, the compliance audit team and make up the safety and emergency response teams. They implement the mechanical integrity, operator training and contractor safety programs.  Employees have access to information created as part of this accident prevention program.   \n\n2.

PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our accidental release prevention programs. \n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each covered process unit. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHAs are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n4. Standard Operating Procedures\n\nWritten standard operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery process units.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and acc"

EHS Operator Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the process units are provided with comprehensive initial training and periodic refresher training.  This training includes a general overview of the process, properties, safety and health hazards of chemicals in the process, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Training is conducted using a combination of classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training. Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n6. Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures & guidelines describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures & guidelines follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI/PM activities are trained on the procedures & guidelines and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \n\n7. Management of Change\n\nPermanent or temporary changes can inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of a process unit. A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the refinery.

Results of the Management of Change process are documented and maintained in the software program, and made available to all personnel.         \n\n8. Pre-startup Safety Review\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews are performed by experienced teams as a final check to ensure the safety of new or modified process facilities before they are placed in service. The review ensures that the following requirements are confirmed prior to start-up: construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; PHAs have been performed on new processes and all recommendations have been resolved; PSI documentation has been properly updated and made available to personnel; MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes; and training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees.\n\n9. Compliance Audits\n\nCompliance Audits ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the accidental release prevention programs are being followed. A formal evaluation and certification of the programs is conducted every year by an audit team. The compliance audit team seeks to confirm that practices are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the process safety regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance. Refinery management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and tracks all findings until they are resolved.\n\n10.

The investigation team then recommends and implements additional controls in order to mitigate hazards associated with the incident.  Incident causes are tracked, trended and published by the Safety Department.  The published reports are shared with employees and relevant findings are communicated throughout the Sunoco organization.\n\n11. Hot Work Permits\n\nHot work permits are issued for any work that could create a source of ignition on or near process units. The hot work permit program ensures that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a process unit.
