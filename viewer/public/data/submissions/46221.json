CBI currently employs over 1400 personnel on a full or part time basis. CBI is the proud sponsor of many youth, civic, academic and public organizations.\n      CBI has two existing warehouses, state of the art facilities in Riviera Beach Florida and Ocala Florida., refrigeration and warehouse facility for wholesale distribution of processed foods and dry goods.\n     The new additional refrigeration construction in Ocala Florida, CBI has the respected design/engineering firm, Mollenberg & Betz, design, build and certify the ammonia refrigeration system the keeps the frozen foods preserved until shipped to the end user. CBI has complied with the Occupational Safety and Health Safety Administration (OSHA) 29CFR1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM) for Anhydrous Ammonia. In preparing the PSM it was determined that there was not a general hazard to employees at the facility due to the fact that the ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system itself. The hazard is present to maintenance personnel when performing repairs or replacing valves, gauges, etc. on the system. This repair work is done in a very well controlled environment which isolates the repair section and reduces the amount of ammonia lost to a very minimum. Since the Ocala facility refrigeration addition is new and in very good working condition; it is estimated that less than 20 pounds of ammonia may been lost from the system per year due to maintenance. All CBI refrigeration maintenance personnel are well trained, certified by Mollenberg & Betz, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration systems. Selected CBI Maintenance, Warehouse, Transportation & Safety  Managers/Supervisors/Personnel are OSHA 40-Hour Hazwoper Trained"

CBI has the necessary emergency response personnel and equipment on-site to handle minor emergencies that may occur. In case of a major release CBI will implement its Emergency Evacuation Plan and inform the local police and fire departments of the situation.  \n    CBI has developed a documented system of checks and balances for maintenance and inspection procedures that have been endorsed by everyone in the CBI Management Team from Byron C. Russell, CEO, thru Danny Wells, Maintenance Director for both facilities, to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. CBI has an on going training program which updates personnel on a routine basis for changes, problems and new technologies pertaining to ammonia refrigeration system.
