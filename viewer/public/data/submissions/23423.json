It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants.\r\nPrimary Activity\r\nThe primary activity at the Victoria SWTP is municipal drinking water treatment.\r\nUse of Regulated Substances\r\nChlorine and Anhydrous Ammonia are used primarily as disinfectants for water introduced into the drinking water supply.\r\nQuantities Handled or Stored\r\nChlorine:  10,000 pounds\tAnhydrous Ammonia:  43,800 pounds\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nThe EPA-defined worst case scenario is a failure of a 2,000-pound container full of chlorine. The 10-minute release is mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because a building encloses the process.  This is the equivalent of 1,100 pounds of chlorine being released. Under worst case weather, chlorine could travel 1.55 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  In the case of an anhydrous ammonia leak, the EPA-defined worst case scenario is a failure of a 10,000 gallon tank full of anhydrous ammonia.  The 10-minute release is not mitigated because the process is located outside.  This is the equivalent of 43,800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia being released.  Under worst case weather, ammonia could travel 2.48 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\r\nA more conceivable chlorine release, although still remote, is a failure of a flexible connection at the ton container.  The release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of"

      "SummaryText": "5.8 pounds per minute and a distance from the Plant of 0.26 miles. However, the plant policy is to replace the flexible connections at prescribed intervals.  A more conceivable anhydrous ammonia release, although still remote, is leak from a pipe or tank truck unloading hose protected by an excess flow valve.  The release would result in a release rate of 84 pounds per minute and a distance from the Plant of 0.31 miles.  Both scenarios for chlorine and ammonia are the most realistic releases that would ever be expected to occur.\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe Victoria SWTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68. Plant and City personnel have conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the Rule. As a result of a Hazard Review at this plant, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some safety items. \r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe Victoria SWTP has never had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by this Rule.\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThis Plant has an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with the community plan.\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe following recommendations, among others, were made as a result of the Victoria SWTP RMP.  Some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. Others are being prioritized and budgeted accordingly.\r\n* We will require each operator to be trained on the plant's O&M.\r\n* We will endeavor to develop and implement a chlorine supplier audit program.  For example, do they have emergency container repair kits? Do they maintain their equipment?  What is their pre-shipment inspection procedure?\r\n* We have developed an Emergency Response Program in coordination with the City of Victoria Fire Department\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\n??\tGES-2\r\nA4223GES.DOC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n??\tGES-1\r\nA4223GES.DOC"
