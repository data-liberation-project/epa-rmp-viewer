      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSun Pacific utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system at their cold storage facility east of Shafter, California.  It is Sun Pacific\u00c2\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Sun Pacific\u00c2\u00bfs objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nSun Pacific emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Sun Pacific and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nSun Pacific has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP regulations).  At least every three years, Sun Pacific audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nSun Pacific owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 33374 Lerdo Highway.  Shafter is the closest city to the Sun Pacific Lerdo Highway Cold Storage facility.  The plant was constructed in 1988.  The refrigeration system has been upgraded several times, with the last expansion completed prior to September 1, 1992.\n\nAt Sun Pacific, anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system which provides process cooling for the cold storage facility.  The system consists of a high pressure receiver, six evaporative condensers, four compressors, three recirculation accumulators, and numerous evaporators.  The three recirculation accumulators and evaporator units provide cooling to the cold storage rooms and the pre-cool/degreening rooms.  Flo"

      "SummaryText": "oded evaporators are utilized in the degreening room.  The halls and truck dock areas are cooled by direct expansion evaporators.   \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be \u00c2\u00bfpumped down\u00c2\u00bf to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 20,987 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Sun Pacific to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least annually.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Pre-startup safety reviews are performed"
