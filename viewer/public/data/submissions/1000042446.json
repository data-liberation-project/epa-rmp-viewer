      "SummaryText": "a distance to end point (rural) of 6 miles.\r\n\r\nTo ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the larges1 quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\" EPA's Cameo (Aloha, marplot, cameo chemical) model used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process. Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this EPA submittal. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not taken into account. Generally, the Sparks Plant components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance  with regulatory requirements.  The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The Chlorine includes the following PSM elements process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; mechanical integrity; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; emergency planning and response. \r\n\r\nThroughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards\r\nInfrastructure security im"

For example, Carus Corporation has created a position for a PSM Specialist to support plants in their PSM activities such as providing audit assistance, process hazard an analysis lead/facilitator role, regulatory updates, PSM incident analysis and sharing best practices. Also, this individual provides leadership, culture, and policy guidance to Carus Corporation and Sierra Chemical Company management regarding their PSM System."
