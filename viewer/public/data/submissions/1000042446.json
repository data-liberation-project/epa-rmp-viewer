Compliance with all expectations set forth in the EHSS Charter will help develop the EHSS culture and ensure Carus operates with the highest standards of safety and environmental awareness. These expectations are a key part of job performance assessments. Carus will not tolerate failure to live up to the expectations outlined in this charter; as such failure could negatively impact the health and safety of our employees, our community, and the environment.  The EHSS Charter has been reviewed and endorsed by Sierra Chemical Company, Sparks Plant personnel and plant management demonstrates EHSS leadership and commitment.\n\nIn addition to EPA's RMP rule, the Sparks plant complies with State and Federal OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's State and Federal Hazardous Waste Generator, DHS Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard and DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nThere are two Worse Case Toxic release scenarios (Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide) and two Alternate Case Chlorine release scenarios (Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide) assessed for the Sparks plant. Section 2 of this RMP submittal contains additional details regarding the Worse Case release scenario while Section 3 contains additional details for the Alternate Case release scenario. \n\n\n\nThe Worse Case toxic release scenarios are briefly described and include: (1) chlorine rail car releasing 195,840 pounds with a distance to end point (rural ) of 6 miles. (2) Sulfur Dioxide rail car release 201,280 pounds with a distance to end point (rural) of 6 miles.\n\n\n\nThe Alternate Case toxic release scenarios are briefly described and include: (1) chlorine process pipe leak releasing 8,096 pounds with a distance to end point (rural) of <3 miles.

      "SummaryText": " a distance to end point (rural) of 6 miles.\n\n\n\nTo ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the larges1 quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\" EPA's Cameo (Aloha, marplot, cameo chemical) model used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process. Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this EPA submittal. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not taken into account. Generally, the Sparks Plant components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance  with regulatory requirements.  The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The Chlorine includes the following PSM elements process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; mechanical integrity; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nThroughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards\n\nInfrastructure security im"

In-plant emergency response team training includes classroom instruction; hands-on demonstrations Each year a plant emergency response team member attend the Mississippi Fire Academy's HAZMAT Response Training.\n\n&#8195;\n\nA plant management team representative attends the Chlorine Institute's Annual and Fall Meetings to learn new safety-related developments and best practices involving the safe production, use and distribution of chlorine.\n\nSeveral changes to improve safety and security are planned, budgeted or being implemented including process controls, mitigation systems, monitoring/detection systems, security physical protection systems, hazard reviews/evaluations, contractor management and additional personnel resources. For example, Carus Corporation has created a position for a PSM Specialist to support plants in their PSM activities such as providing audit assistance, process hazard an analysis lead/facilitator role, regulatory updates, PSM incident analysis and sharing best practices. Also, this individual provides leadership, culture, and policy guidance to Carus Corporation and Sierra Chemical Company management regarding their PSM System.\n\n"
