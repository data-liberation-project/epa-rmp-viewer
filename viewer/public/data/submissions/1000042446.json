      "SummaryText": " a distance to end point (rural) of 6 miles.\n\n\n\nTo ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the larges1 quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\" EPA's Cameo (Aloha, marplot, cameo chemical) model used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process. Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this EPA submittal. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not taken into account. Generally, the Sparks Plant components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance  with regulatory requirements.  The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA.
