Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Bromine..  Chlorine is used in the ion displacement process.  Chloride ions are used to displace bromide ions in the raw brine.  Elemental bromine is precipitated.  Bromine is reacted with hydrogen to form hydrogen bromide.  The hydrogen bromide is then further reacted with calcium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide to form calcium or sodium bromide.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 540,000.00 lb. while Bromine is present at our facility in a quantity of 420,000.00 lb.\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTHE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operat"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What if/ Checklist, Dow Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazard Analysis and HAZOP .  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/29/2003.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nTHE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTHE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized trai"

Changes must be reviewed and approved by appropriate subject matter experts.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 07/14/2004.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are often included in the review and approval process and are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT.  The most recent review was performed on 10/12/2000.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTHE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 07/21/2003.
