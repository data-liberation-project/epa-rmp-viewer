The EH&S Manager reports directly to the president of the TRCC, allowing the EH&S Manager to make environmental issues an integral part of company operations.\n\nIt is Tiarco's policy that operators do not conduct emergency response actions. As of October 2010, TRCC is in the process of developing an on-site emergency response team that will serve Tiarco and the other companies of TRCC. This emergency response team will meet the requirements of OSHA's HAZWOPER regulations.\n\nTiarco Facility & Regulated Substances\n\nTiarco is a specialty chemical manufacturer operating both chemical reaction processes and chemical blending processes. Tiarco uses the following RMP regulated substances:  carbon disulfide (75-15-0); dimethylamine (124-40-3); and monomethylamine (74-89-5). In addition, Tiarco uses diethylamine (109-98-7) which is regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management program. All four of these chemicals are stored in bulk quantities in stationary storage tanks. All of the processes and chemicals produced using the RMP regulated substances are known as carbamates.\n\nTiarco is located in Dalton, Georgia and is part of a larger collection of TRCC plants located on a single campus. Tiarco employs approximately 35 people. The total employment at the Dalton campus is approximately 180.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTiarco complies with both the EPA's Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety M"

Both of these regulatory programs include detailed requirements addressing areas such as process safety information, hazard assessment, mechanical integrity, contractor safety, operating procedures, management of change, and incident investigation. As part of implementing these programs, Tiarco has developed a PSM/RMP Program Manual that provides written guidance for following all of these regulatory requirements. In addition, the Program Manual includes working logs to help Tiarco management track implementation of the programs.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past 5 years.\n"
