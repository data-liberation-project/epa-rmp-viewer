All included information was reviewed and approved by Cardinal management prior to resubmission of this RMP.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nCardinal is committed to worker and public safety and has invested significant resources to prevent accidents.\n\nThese resources include personnel training as well as considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nIt is Cardinal's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release and notify external emergency responders, as necessary. The facility also maintains: a Health & Safety Plan and a Spill Prevention, Control & Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\n\n\nThe Cardinal ethanol plant is located in Union City, Randolph County, Indiana. The facility utilizes corn/milo to produce ethanol via natural fermentation to produce fuel grade ethanol for blending with gasoline and other motor fuels. Co-products produced as a result of ethanol manufacturing include Dried Distiller's Grains with Solubles (DDGS), corn oil and carbon dioxide. The substance regulated under the RMP program is Natural Gasoline (Flammable Mixture), also known as Denaturant. Denaturant (Natural Gasoline) is used at the facility for blending with ethanol to comply with Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regulations to allow final sale of the product.\n\n\n\nPlease note that Cardinal has discontinued the use of Anhydrous Ammonia at the facility and has had none on-site as of December 31, 2011. The Anhydrous Ammonia tank system and all of its components are empty and have been locked out to prevent usage. The system will remain secured on-site in the event Anhydrous Ammo"
