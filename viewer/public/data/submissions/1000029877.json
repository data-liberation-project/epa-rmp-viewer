The refrigerated areas are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available.  However, the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\r\n\r\n\tThe HRSC Milk Plant chose to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The Milk Plant ammonia refrigeration system of the Houston Retail Support Center (HRSC) of H.E. Butt Grocery Company (HEB) has a total of 21,920 pounds in the  refrigeration systems.\r\n\r\n\tThe HRSC Milk Plant complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR).  The operators of the systems are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n\tThe Accidental Release Prevention Program does not guarantee against an accidental release.  An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The worst case scenario considered the loss of 6,500  pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system over a 10 minute period.  The analysis showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately 1.0 miles.

There are residents and other public receptors (recreational areas and industrial/commercial buildings) located in the potentially affected area.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were used to limit the chemical release distances for either scenario.\r\n\r\n\tThe HRSC Milk Plant has an established Emergency Action Plan to respond to emergencies.  The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan.  The plan requires employees to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area.  The emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency.  The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors.  Maintenance personnel will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency.  The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and utility outages.\r\n\r\n\tThis location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years.\r\n\t\t\r\n\tThe HRSC Milk Plant wanted to evaluate the potential failures of the refrigeration system, and if the safeguards were sufficient to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.

This is a revised RMP submission for a cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration system in this facility has an inventory of approximately 18,720 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard. Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\r\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.

The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room.\r\nAlthough there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system.

The worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the low temperature recirculator (V-3) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system \r\ndesign that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling this vessel causing the released quantity to be 6,000 pounds with no piping volume included. The distance to toxic end point of 0.9 miles.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario evaluated in this hazard assessment is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of 15 minutes. The quanty of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (150 lbs/min) with a release duration of fifteen (15) minutes and travel distance of 0.1 mile.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP. Following is an overview.\r\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole. As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate\r\ndirectly in every phrase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits."

However, the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\r\nThe HRSC PDC chose to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. The Perishable Distribution Center (PDC) ammonia refrigeration system at the Houston Retail Support Center (HRSC) of H.E. Butt Grocery Company (HEB) has a total of 11,367 pounds in the refrigeration system.\r\nThe HRSC PDC complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR). The operators of the systems are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program does not guarantee against an accidental release. An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system. The worst case scenario considered the loss of 3,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system over a 10 minute period. The analysis showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately 0.8 miles. There are residents which could be potentially affected in the identified radius.

No administrative controls or mitigation measures were used to\r\nlimit the chemical release distances for either scenario.\r\n\r\nThe HRSC PDC has an established Emergency Action Plan to respond to emergencies. The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan. The plan requires employees to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area. The emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency. The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors. Maintenance personnel will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency. The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and utility outages. This location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years.  The HRSC PDC wanted to evaluate the potential failures of the refrigeration system, and if the safeguards were sufficient to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  Process Hazard Analysis was completed on the refrigeration system on June 20, 2011. Planned changes to improve safety resulting from this analysis are documented in the Process Hazard Analysis report in the Accidental Chemical Release Prevention Program.

The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\r\nThe refrigeration system in this facility has an inventory of approximately 22,552 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard. Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\r\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan has been provided to the local LEPC for review.\r\n\r\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\r\nThis food distribution facility operates a multi-temperature, single stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with a refrigeration load of 550 TR and an engine room compressor capacity of 1465 TR @ +20\u00b0F suction temperature.This refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an over-feed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717)refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system.\r\nThis ammonia refrigeration system contains four interconnected sub-systems:\r\n1.Evaporator system (+20\u00b0F @ 33.5 PSIG).\r\n2.High-pressure receiver system (95\u00b0F @ 181 PSIG).\r\n3.Condenser system (95\u00b0F C.T. 79\u00b0F W.B.).\r\n4.Compressor system (+20\u00b0FST/+95\u00b0FCT).\r\nMajor equipment located inside the engine room includes:\r\n\u00b7One compre"

The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It\r\nalso starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the high temperature recirculator (V-1) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-fill"
