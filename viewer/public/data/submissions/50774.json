      "SummaryText": "Pine Lake Corn Processors, L.P. (PLCP) operates an ethanol fuel production plant located near Steamboat Rock, in Hardin County, Iowa.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, PLCP completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that exceed reporting thresholds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nPLCP is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. PLCP uses natural gasoline as a denaturant to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  PLCP uses aqueous ammonia is for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  It is the policy of PLCP to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of PLCP to notify the Steamboat Rock Fire Department and the Hardin County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel-grade ethanol from corn and a process byproduct known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of natural gasoline, or denaturant, which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance. The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is approximately 154,123 pounds (total pentane approximately 61,649 pounds, assuming a 40% concentration).  The natural gasoline is stored in an aboveground tank as a liquid and is mixed with the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in a tank farm, which is surrounded by a secondary containment structure.   Aqueous ammonia at up to 20% concentration is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process as a pH control.  The maximum amount o"

      "SummaryText": "f ammonia that could be stored is 93,000 pounds.  PLCP has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to the reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented. PLCP has coordinated emergency response with local authorities and responding agencies and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, PLCP has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP and Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nPLCP began operations in 2005. PLCP has no history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering."
