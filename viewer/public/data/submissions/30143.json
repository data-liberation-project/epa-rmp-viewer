We remain committed to the Health and Safety to the employees, community and environment.  Our company has an aggressive prevention and preventive maintenance program and policy. \n\nIt is our policy that all Emergencies can be avoided by proper engineering of facilities and adequate training of all personnel in the proper operating procedures for facility equipment, processes and understanding of potential hazards.  Although remote, the possibility of a facility-wide emergency does exist;  Therefore DIAB has developed an emergency action and prevention plan.\n\nThe purpose of our plan is to establish responsibility for various functions involved in prevention and the handling of a facility emergency and outlines the proper procedures for handling emergency situations with the minimization of harm to facility personnel, equipment, the surrounding community, and the environment.   \n\nThe plan consists of three component segments:\n\n1.  Organization, Engineering, and Prevention\n\nThis section provides information on measures to prevent or reduce the impact of an emergency at the facility.  This section also provides information necessary to comply with Federal, State and local regulations for reporting release of hazardous materials.\n\n2.  Response\n\nAddresses procedures that apply in the event of a fire, explosion, hazardous gas/vapor release, hazardous material spill, injury to personnel or natural disaster.\n\nThis section utilizes tables, flowcharts and checklists to provide an easy-to-use decision tool for personnel engaged in controlling and minimizing the adverse impact of an emergency.\n\n3.  Annexes\n\nProvides a means to update compliance issues, process changes, distribution and audits that are required by federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe most important"

      "SummaryText": " component of emergency planning at DIAB is prevention.  Preventive measures range from employee training, industrial indoor air quality testing, and facility inspection programs to engineering design of hazardous processes.  \n\nOur five-year history has had no reportable spills.\n\nWe continue to examine alternative material uses through research and development.  DIAB has had a significant reduction of over 50% in the use of TDI during the last 2 years with an additional 25% reduction expected within the year."
