      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at P. B. & S. CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with ORLANDO FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid, and Aqua Ammonia.  Chlorine is received into Chattanooga in 180,000 pound railcars.  The product is then repackaged in different size containers for distribution to customers.  The Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid and Aqua Ammonia are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid and Aqua Ammonia  are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 1,664,900 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid and Aqua Ammonia  are present at our facility in quantities of 58,700 lbs., 7,670 lbs., and 83,281  respectively.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we"
