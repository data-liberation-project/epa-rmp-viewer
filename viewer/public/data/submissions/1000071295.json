      "SummaryText": "WPX Energy Permian, LLC operates a refrigeration skid designed to recover propane, butane and natural gasoline from gas prior to gathering and final treatment at the Hattie 3-1H Compressor Station in Mentone, TX.  This report provides the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the recovery skid system, pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. EPA RMP rule.\r\n\r\nThe system is designed to remove natural gas liquids (NGL) from gas at the wellhead, having an inlet pressure between 150 and 400 psi.  The refrigeration system can generate temperatures as low as -20\u00b0F.  This system is used to remove liquids from flared gases.  There will be two NGL storage tanks onsite. One tank has an 18,000 gallon capacity and the other tank has a 12,000 gallon capacity. The 30,000 gallon total is equivalent to 134,490 lbs. of flammable liquids.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004. This facility is regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMP plans must be prepared for processes that store in excess of the thresholds set forth by 40 CFR 68.130. For flammable liquids, the threshold is 10,000 lbs.  Hattie 3-1H CS can store approximately 134,490 lbs. of NGL and exceeds 10,000 lbs. threshold, thus the facility is subject to the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule and must prepare a RMP."
