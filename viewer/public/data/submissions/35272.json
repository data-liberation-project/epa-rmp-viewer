      "SummaryText": "Alabama Power Company's Plant E.C. Gaston, located near Wilsonville, Alabama, is a 5 unit steam electric generating plant.  Plant Gaston has two (2) cooling towers to help reduce the temperature of the water that is discharged into the Coosa River.  In order to treat the water, chlorine is injected into the cooling tower system.  Two (2) cylinders of chlorine are attached to a manifold for this purpose.  Four (4) additional cylinders are kept as spares in this location.  Therefore, the total quantity of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2500 lbs.  A Process Safety Management (PSM) program is in effect under OSHA for Plant Gaston, therefore Program 3 applies.\n\nThe main hazard that would be associated with the chlorine is a toxic hazard.  The most likely event is the leaking of the manifold attached to the cylinders or the rupture of the cylinders.  The cylinders are protected from traffic around the facility by open sided steel framed sheds.  When it is necessary to replace empty cylinders, trained personnel remove and connect full chlorine cylinders to the manifold.  Therefore, a rupture that would result in the rapid release of chlorine is unlikely.  Due to the sparse population around the plant, even with the worst case scenario, public exposure would be limited.\n\nRMP COMP model was used to determine the worst case and alternative case scenario for the release of chlorine gas.  Plant Gaston did not exceed the threshold amounts for flammables.\n\nIn order to insure that releases of chlorine do not occur, daily visual and documented weekly inspections are performed by plant personnel.  Plant Gaston also has an outside contractor perform yearly maintenance inspections on the chlorination system.  We feel these programs greatly reduce the possibility of an accidental release of chlorine.\n\nPlant Gaston has not had any spills of chlorine in the past 5 years.\n\nPlant Gaston does have a written emergency response plan that includes the release of chlorine.
