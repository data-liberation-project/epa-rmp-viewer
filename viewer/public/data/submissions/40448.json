Facility Policy:   The  owner , management, and employees of  Bayhill Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidential releases of anhydrous ammoia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspection and maintence and training of all personal that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur the orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so the plan for response to any release and minimize the inpact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n               2.       Facility information:    The primary activity at the facility is storage of fertilizer for sale to farmer.Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a NUTRIRNT for crop production.The maximun quantity stored would be 385,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n                 3.       Worse-case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:   The worse case release scenario would be the release of the total content of one of the storage tank release as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quinity release would be 71,450 pounds, which represents the volume of one of the storage tank at 85 persent capacity as limited by design standard and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion base on the model used is .94 miles.\n\n                         The alternative case release scenario is assumed to be release from a rupure of a 1 inch trasfer hose , with 2900 pounds release over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .31 miles.\n\n                4.
