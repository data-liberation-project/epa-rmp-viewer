The RMPr describes the Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, and Emergency Response.\n\n\n\nThis Facility stores and handles a 25% ammonia concentrated solution in a 30,000-gallon aboveground storage tank (AST).  The process equipment includes the AST and ancillary process piping, valves, and transfer hose.\n\n\n\nThe Facility receives aqua ammonia by a Contractor that transports the aqua ammonia with a commercial cargo tank.  The commercial cargo tank is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the aqua ammonia is transferred to the stationary AST.  The Contractor performs the transfer of aqua ammonia from the commercial cargo tank to the stationary PV.  The Facility does not own or operate the commercial cargo tank.  The Contractor is responsible for training their operators and maintaining their equipment.  At a minimum, the Contractor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT, OSHA, state and local regulatory requirements, (2) make available to the Facility and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for aqua ammonia transfer operations.  The Facility coordinates with the Contractor on Emergency Contingency procedures and will provide access to the Facility RMPr upon request by the Contractor.\n\n\n\nTrained Process Operators operate the covered process which includes the storage of aqua ammonia in the AST.  These operations are conducted in accordance with the RMP Operating Procedures.  Trained personnel perform maintenance on this covered process in accordance with the RMP Mechanical Integrity Procedures.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Agri-Enterprises, LLC Maple Park, IL Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68.  Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the ammonia concentration in the aqua solution is less than 40% by weight and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC (Helena) is submitting the EPA RMP as a 5-year update.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the maximum quantity of aqua ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 47,953 lbs.  Although the maximum quantity of aqua ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 47,953 lbs, the total quantity reported in this EPA RMP Report is 95,906 lbs.  The reason for this is because the single aqua ammonia AST (i.e47,953 lbs) is counted a second time to account for the Base Blending process that is connected to the single stationary AST.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  Two chemicals (i.e. anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration) are stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\n?    Covered Process 1: Aqua Ammonia S&H\n\n?    Covered Process 2: Base Blending\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the two (2) covered processes.  The worst case scenario for Covered Processes 1 and 2 assumes that "

      "SummaryText": "all the contents in the largest (i.e. 30,000 gallons) single aboveground storage tank (AST) are released.  The release scenario assumes that the 30,000-gallon aqua ammonia AST fails and instantaneously spills the content into secondary containment that has a total containment capacity greater than 30,000 gallons when considering displacement of the other ASTs within the containment.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes a rupture of a transfer hose during transfer from the commercial cargo tank to the AST.   The release occurs in the cargo tank transfer area which has a total containment capacity greater than 800 gallons.  The alternative scenario for Covered Process 2 assumes a rupture of a transfer hose or pipe during transfer from the AST to the Blender.   The release occurs in the tank farm containment which has a total containment capacity greater than 30,000 gallons when considering displacement of the other ASTs within the containment.  Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, inju"

The RMP will be updated as the Facility adds, deletes, or makes changes to the process. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the local LEPC and Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
