Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 273000 pounds in the facilities 1 fixed storage tank and nurse tanks parked at the site.\r\n\r\n3.  The worst-case release scenario: NOT DISCLOSED\r\n\r\nThe alternative-case release scenario: NOT DISCLOSED\r\n\r\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with  the Rules and  Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations      Administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI   K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous Ammonia. \r\n\r\n5.  The Five-year Accident History :  There have been no releases of ammonia from this facility in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n6.   The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action   plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local   authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as  required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.
