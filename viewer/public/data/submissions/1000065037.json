Five year accident history\n\n\n\nWithin the past 5 years, this facility has had no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.The emergency response program\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required. All response team members attend annual CHLOREP refresher training including the use of response equipment on simulated leaks. We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nThis distribution facility was constructed in 1970 and has been operated by Harcros Chemicals Inc. since 1993.  We continue to participate in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  Over the next couple of years Harcros is upgrading its Fire Protection and Security systems.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n"
