This commitment is demonstrated by its accidental release prevention program that includes management practices in areas such as operating procedures, equipment maintenance, hazard analysis and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. \nIt is the policy of Golden Maid Packers to implement appropriate controls to prevent to the greatest extent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    Regulated Substances\nThe only regulated substance held at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n \n3.    Worst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis, the EPA's RMP *Comp\u00c2\u00bf and 2000 US Census data per LandView 5 were used.  Our worst-case scenario involves the catastrophic rupture of our primary receiver tank and the loss of its entire contents over a ten-minute span.  Our first alternative scenario involves the rupture of a pipe carrying high pressure gaseous anhydrous ammonia.  Our second alternative scenario involves the development of a leak in a vessel containing low pressure liquid anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nGolden Maid Packers maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identifi"

This study was undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Golden Maid Packers maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \nTraining:\nGolden Maid Packers has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.  Documentation of this training is kept in our main business office.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nGolden Maid Packers carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place at Golden Maid Packers to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most rece"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Golden Maid Packers. The most recent review was performed on 04/22/2005.  (Our facility has not undergone any process changes since that date.) These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nGolden Maid Packers conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 05/07/2009.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nGolden Maid Packers promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\nGolden Maid Packers truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Golden Maid Packers has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History:\nGolden Maid Packers has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, we have never had an accidental release.\n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan:\nGolden Maid Packers carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nWe strive to continue our excellent safety record by continuing to keep our employees informed of the hazards associated with our facility and to continue our diligence in maintaining a safe system."
