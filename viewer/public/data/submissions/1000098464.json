The ammonia refrigeration process at NORPEL has been designed and operates in accordance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable State and Local codes and regulations.  NORPEL has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the process, and the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in voluntary compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management rule.\r\n\r\nThrough the NORPEL Emergency Action Plan as required under OSHA PSM, NORPEL has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nNORPEL is a seafood processing plant primarily engaged in the processing of mackerel and other seafood products.  The facility is situated  on an .62 acre industrially zoned parcel, and is a 32,253 sq. ft facility utilizing 20,959 lbs of anhydrous ammonia within the process.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As the NORPEL anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds the threshold, the facility is subject to the Risk Management Program and required to prepare an RMP for the process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions, and it is not eligible for Program 1.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with ANSI/ASHRAE guidance, as well as the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Standards.

The schedule of such verifications is at least once every three years.\r\n\r\nAn off-site consequence analysis has bee completed for a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario to document the distance to toxic endpoint for each scenario, as well as the potential population, public and environmental receptors that fall within the radius of impact for each scenario.\r\n\r\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of NORPEL's daily operations.  PM is performed in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases the process safety equipment PM Schedule prescribed by NORPEL exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.  Ammonia detection sensors are present at multiple locations and tested semi-annually.  Relief Valves are replaced on a 5 yr schedule according to best practices.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn the last 5 years there have been no reportable releases that caused death, injury, hospitalization or property damage.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located in the processing area and the ammonia machinery room. A process release would also be detected by the employees by the characteristic odor of anhydrous ammonia at 3-5 ppm.  The ammonia sensors are tested semi-annually.  An alarm signal is triggered and would sound throughout the facility, as well as activate blue strobes if ammonia is detected.  An alarm system and control panel also notify specific individuals if operating parameters are exceeded, or an alarm occurs.  \r\n\r\nIn the event of a process release, the  Control System provides notification to the Plant Manager, and select NORPEL personnel.
