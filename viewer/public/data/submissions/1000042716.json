This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event of such a release, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Koochiching County Sheriff's Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nBoise owns and operates an integrated pulp and paper mill at this location.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility, Chlorine Dioxide.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Chlorine Dioxide is used for pulp bleaching and biocide treatment of water in the paper machine and filter plant areas.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine Dioxide at our facility is 29,550 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nBoise maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur fac"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Boise  maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.  These procedures are certified annually.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nBoise has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating Chlorine Dioxide process are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nBoise carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.
