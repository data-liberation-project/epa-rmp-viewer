      "SummaryText": "Foremost Farms USA (Foremost Farms) stores up to 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at the fruit juice plant located at 3101 Fish Hatchery Road, Madision, Wisconsin (the Property).  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the facility. The quantity stored exceeds the 10,000  pound TQ for ammonia, and is therefore regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  Foremost Farms maintains compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (29 CFR 1910.119), the Process Safety Managemetn (PSM) standard.  The required elements of PSM include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractors.  These elements are also required under Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68).  Foremost Farms maintains these elements for compliance with OSHA PSM andEPA Risk Management Program.  In addition to the prevention program elements listed above, Foremost Farms completes the other items required for EPA Risk Management Program.  These items include an Emergency Response Program, a Management System, a Hazard Assessment, and Submittal of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Emergency Response Program includes coordinating with a local emergency responder as well as maintaining an emergency response team on site.  The management system consists of the operations manager having overall responsibility for the Risk Management Program with support from the maintenance supervisor.  The hazard assessment including the off-site consequence analysis and 5-year accident history is completed in accordance with EPA guidance at the specified intervals.  Finally, the RMP was submitted prior to the EPA by June 21, 1999.  The RMP was updated in 2002 and again updated in 2006."
