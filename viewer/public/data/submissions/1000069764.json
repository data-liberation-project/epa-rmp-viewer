Our safety strategy revolves around our \"Do It Right\" value and permeates our business in three key ways:\n\n?    Robust systems that provide a clear, repeatable direction toward excellence.\n\n?    Superior performance that aligns effective and efficient EHS activities with operations.\n\n?    Engaged culture that empowers consistent behaviors that drive toward excellence.\n\nCF Industries works closely with emergency responders and other local officials to develop detailed emergency response plans that extend beyond our physical operating locations.\n\n\n\nBlair Terminal and the regulated substances handled:\n\nBlair Terminal stores and distributes anhydrous ammonia. The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than the threshold quantity are anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Blair Terminal has taken all the necessary steps to comply with all of the accidental release and chemical-specific prevention requirements as set forth in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68. This facility is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following summarizes the elements of the release and chemical-specific prevention that are in place at our facility:\n\n?    Process safety information that is accurate and up to date;\n\n?    Well-trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel;\n\n?    Written operating procedures;\n\n?    Mechanical integrity procedures for process equipment inspections and quality control;\n\n?    Management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures;\n\n?

Hot work permitting verifying the implementation of fire prevention and protection requirements prior to the beginning of hot work operations;\n\n?    Coordination with local emergency and fire responders;\n\n?    Stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation; and\n\n?    Formal policies for contractor management\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\nThis facility has had two accidental releases subject to EPA 40 CFR Part 68 within the last five years. On 2/21/18 a truck driver injured his forearm while unloading anhydrous ammonia from his truck to our truck rack. A small amount of ammonia impacted his forearm at the interface of the sleeves of his chemical resistant suits long sleeves and the chemical resistant gloves. The injury was classified as medical treatment. On 2/23/18, there was a release of approximately 415 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere from the flare stack due to the failure of liquid level sensing equipment in a process vessel. An industrial neighbor ordered some of their employees to shelter-in-place as a precaution.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn accordance with a June 14, 2018 determination by EPA Region 7, the Blair Terminal is designated as a \"non-responding\" facility, and the information specified in Section 9. Emergency Response of the RMP is based on such designation. Notwithstanding, the Blair Terminal has an extensive emergency response program with a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all federal, state, and local laws are complied wi"

The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nRigorous training, drills, audits, cooperation with emergency responders and local officials, recognition programs and participation in industry safety initiatives help keep our focus on what it takes to \"Do It Right.\" Through our ongoing commitment to make our facility as safe as possible for employees, contractors, the community, and the environment, we are always continuously improving our systems and practices. \n\n"
