Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Frontier Fertilizer, Johnstown, Colorado, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhyrdous ammonia and/or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\na) The primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia and/or aqua ammonia is the storage of said chemicals for the sale to growers as fertilizer.  These two chemicals are received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nb) Anhydrous Ammonia:  The maximum quantity stored in the largest storage tank is approximately 47,700 pounds.  This represents filling the largest storage tank to 85% of capacity.  There are two large storage tanks on site.  Anhydrous ammonia is shipped to the facility by bulk truck.\n\nc) Aqua Ammonia: The maximum quantity stored in the largest storage tank is approximately 45000 pounds.\nThe two storage tanks on site are situated in a diked area.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\na) Anhydrous Ammonia:  The WORST-CASE scenario is based on the entire contents of one of the storage tanks being released over a 10-minute period.  The quantity released would equal approximately 47,700 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank filled to 85% of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point is .79.\n\nb) Aqua Ammonia:  The WORST-CASE scenario is based on the entire contents of one of the storage tanks being released over a 74.5-minute period.  The quantity released would equal approximately 9000 pounds.  The distance to the end point is .72\n\nc)Anhydrou"
