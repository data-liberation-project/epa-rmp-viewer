Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Frontier Fertilizer, Johnstown, Colorado, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhyrdous ammonia and/or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\na) The primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia and/or aqua ammonia is the storage of said chemicals for the sale to growers as fertilizer.  These two chemicals are received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nb) Anhydrous Ammonia:  The maximum quantity stored in the largest storage tank is approximately 47,700 pounds.  This represents filling the largest storage tank to 85% of capacity.  There are two large storage tanks on site.  Anhydrous ammonia is shipped to the facility by bulk truck.\n\nc) Aqua Ammonia: The maximum quantity stored in the largest storage tank is approximately 45000 pounds.\nThe two storage tanks on site are situated in a diked area.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\na) Anhydrous Ammonia:  The WORST-CASE scenario is based on the entire contents of one of the storage tanks being released over a 10-minute period.  The quantity released would equal approximately 47,700 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank filled to 85% of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point is .79.\n\nb) Aqua Ammonia:  The WORST-CASE scenario is based on the entire contents of one of the storage tanks being released over a 74.5-minute period.  The quantity released would equal approximately 9000 pounds.  The distance to the end point is .72\n\nc)Anhydrou"

      "SummaryText": "s Ammonia:  The ALTERNATE-CASE is based on a release caused by a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would equal approximately 26,000 pounds.  The distance to end point is .56.\n\nd)Aqua Ammonia:  The ALTERNATE-CASE based on a release caused by a pipe leak.  The quantity released would equal approximately 600 pounds.  The distance to end point is .09.\n\n4. The Accident Release Prevention Program\n\na) This facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI publication K-61-1 \"Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nb) This facility is in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handlingof Anhydrous Ammonia\"\n\nc) This facility follows the anhydrous ammonia standards regulated by the Colorado Department of Ag.\n\nd) This facility follows the State Fertilizer Containment Standards for  Aqua Ammonia.\n\ne)  This facility is inspected on at least a monthly basis by employees knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia and/or Aqua Ammonia. \n\n5. The Five Year Accident History\n\nFrontier Fertilizer has had NO accidents at the Johnstown Facility in the previous 5 years.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Plan\n\na) This facility has a written Emergency Response Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.36.\n\nb) This facility has provided State and Local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc) This facility has a written emergency response in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120, which includes pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions, as well as to evaluate employee training programs.  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia and/or aqua ammonia safety recommendations to be made at this time."
