This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority (PRASA) wich is a Government Agency.PRASA  has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for management and prevention of risks associated with the storage and use of chlorine, a regulated toxic substance, at the Los Filtros Water Filtration Plant.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112&reg;(1).  The Prevention Program elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and State requirements.  The disinfection process at  Los Filtros Water Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Los Filtros Water Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine.  The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Los Filtros Water Filtration Plant and the immediately surrounding areas.  Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency response program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Los Filtros Water Filtration Plant supplies  water to the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water, destroying microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered  from the Puerto Nuevo Distribution Center to the plant in 1 ton containers by truck. Chlorine containers are connected to valves and through them the chlorine flows  to 8 vacuum chlorinators.  From the chlorina"

This guidance considers the release of the cholrine gas of an  entire container (2000 Pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the  weather conditions and a radius of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene association exposure limit wich is determine human health will be affected.                                                                                                                                                                           \n\nAlternative case Scenario. The more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant parameters, as a release of the total content of a container, but throughtout a pipe leak. In the case the end point distance is calculated at 0.1 miles and some public receptors are identified over the most recent maps. .                                                                                       \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program                                                                                                                     \n\nPRASA is actually in a very agrgressive operation to implement a Prvention Plan to ensure the maintenace and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of current prevention plans. Different Standard Operational Procedures (SOP) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.

It is recommended to replace the chlorine feeder device from a high preassure system to a low preassure system (vacuum).  \n\n\n\nAudits\n\n\n\nThe last compliance audit was conducted on october 22, 2010.
