This facility has not had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Butane Blending System, it is the Parties' policy to initially contact the owner of the equipment - Energy Transfer LP and the local fire department.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the local fire department.  The Chesapeake Fire Department personnel have participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\r\n\r\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.  Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this stationary source as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection. \r\n\r\nThe Parties actively seek employee input on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Chesapeake Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."
