Staffing at Decatur Plant is currently approximately 277 \n\nAscend employees and approximately 100 permanent resident contractor employees.  Ascend is expanding the production of a primary product, adiponitrile (ADN).  The expansion began in 2017 and will be completed by the end of 2022.  It has been determined that expansion does not affect RMP.\n\n\n\nBuilt in 1952, the Decatur Plant is situated on a 651.82 acre tract (peninsula), 4 miles west of the City of Decatur, on the Tennessee River (river mile 302).  The peninsula is shared by guest operations.  Linde occupies 4 acres, Calpine 20 acres, Toray 50 acres, Styrolution 21 acres.  Over 300 acres are presently in use by Ascend.  The remainder acreage is the old Acrilan footprint which is currently unutilized.\n\n\n\nThe plant was designed to primarily manufacture Acrilan acrylic fiber and various nylon intermediate chemicals for the production of nylon fiber.  In April of 2005, the production of Acrilan permanently ceased at this site.  The bulk chemicals in the production units and tanks were subsequently removed, with completion occurring by the end of the Third Quarter of 2005.  There are three toxic chemicals in our remaining processes that are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  The RMP regulated chemicals are:\n\n        Acrylonitrile (AN) -- A raw material to make nylon intermediate chemicals.    \n\nPropionitrile (PN) -- A co-product from manufacture of nylon Intermediate chemicals.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\nThe main raw material for production of nylon chemicals (i.e., AN) arrives at the plant by barge on the Tennessee River.  AN is fed to an electrohydrodimerization system to produce a mixture of liquid and gas phases.  The organic liquid phase is pumped to raw material recovery and refining processing areas.  AN prestripper columns are used to remove waste from the liquid phase.  Refined ADN is used onsite and shipped offsite.  The co-products of ADN production are ADN flasher tails (AFT), PN, and low boiler make.  All three can be burned on site while AFT and PN can be sold.  ADN gets converted to hexamethylenediamine (HMD) in a two-phase hydrogenation reaction.  Co-products of HMD production are amine heads and bis-hexamethyleneriamine (BHMT).  Both can be sold or burned on site.\n\n\n\nAscend Decatur Plant has officially adopted the following Environmental, Safety, Health and Security Policy and is committed to the success of the program:\n\n\n\n** The Plant Manager and the Responsible Care 14001 Management Representative of the Ascend Inc., Decatur Plant are committed to the implementation and maintenance of this Policy.

The employee was working on an analyzer and removed a transmitter pad without a proper work permit.  Electrolyte containing AN was released and drained to come in contact with the employees work boot.  The chemical soaked through his work boots and caused 2nd degree chemical burns on his feet.  The employee did not seek immediate medical attention.  A formal root cause analysis investigation followed this event.  The investigation report is available at the Decatur site.\n\n\n\nOn February 22, 2019, at approximately 16:30, a logistics operator was finishing a Hexamethylenediamine ISO.

At the hospital he received an prescription for nausea and was released.  \n\n\n\n6.0  Emergency Response Program\n\nWe at the Decatur plant use several types of safety audits to ensure that our plant runs safely.  Following are some of the different types of audits, inspections and reviews that are conducted: PSM and Non-PSM audits, ISO audits, Corporate and Insurance surveys and audits, Environmental and Industrial Hygiene audits, RC 14001 audits, and supervisor audits.  We conduct pre-engineering safety audits and inspections on new process before any engineering work is done.  During the phase of construction walk-through safety inspections are completed.  Pre-startup safety reviews are done before the process is started.\n\n\n\nAscend at Decatur, Alabama is very dedicated in preparation just in case we might have an emergency.  The entire Emergency Response Team receives CPR and First Aid/AED training.  We have approximately 45 firefighters across the 5 shifts that we work.  These firefighters train 48 hours annually at the site on incidents involving flammable liquid fires, interior firefighting, hazardous communications, incident command and others.  Our firefighters receive off-site training at fire schools such as LSU and Texas A&M.  We have two fire trucks on-site.  One fire truck is equipped with foam and another truck is equipped with dry chemical extinguishing agent to supplement the 8 fire pumps that draw fire water from the river.\n\n\n\nCurrently, we have 9 EMTs training 24 hours annually on trauma assessment, burn care, confined space rescue and others.  The EMT's receive 8 hour CPR and 1st aid training every other year.  On alternating years, the EMT's receive EVOC and EMR training.  We have a fully stocked ambulance readily"
