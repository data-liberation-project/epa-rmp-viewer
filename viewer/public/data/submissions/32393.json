Its two water filtration plants, drawing from the Potomac and Patuxent Rivers, produce an average of 166 million gallons of potable water per day, and over 5,000 miles of water mains deliver that product to homes and businesses in Prince George's and Montgomery Counties.  The Commission operates four raw water reservoirs, with a total capacity of over 14 billion gallons, to ensure a reliable water supply for all seasons and conditions.\n\nSix wastewater treatment plants operated by WSSC provide wastewater treatment.  Every day an average of 181 million gallons of wastewater from Prince George's and Montgomery Counties move to facilities through 4,900 miles of sewers maintained by the WSSC.  The six WSSC wastewater treatment plants have a combined capacity of over 73 million gallons per day (mgd).  Under the Inter-municipal Agreement, WSSC is allocated 169 mgd of Blue Plains' capacity.  WSSC, in turn, pays a share of the Blue Plains' operating and capital expenses.\n\nIV. POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nA six-member commission governs WSSC - three members from each county.  The Commissioners are appointed to four-year terms by their respective county executives, and confirmed by their county councils.\n\nThe Commission's powers and responsibilities are set forth in State law and in subsequent legislative amendments.  The Maryland General Assembly conferred these powers upon the WSSC to enable it to fulfill its principal functions.\n\nThe Commission's major functions are to:\n\n? provide for the construction, operation, and maintenance of water supply and sanitary sewerage systems in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties,\n? approve the locations of, and issue permits for, utilities installed in public ways, and\n? establish waster consumption rates, sewer usage rates, connection charges, front foot benefit charges, and permit fees, and if required, cause ad valorem taxes to be levied.\n\nThe Commission also:\n\n? reviews preliminary subd"

WSSC'S DEDICATION TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PROTECTION\nOF PUBLIC HEALTH\nHistorically WSSC has always taken its responsibilities related to accident prevention, emergency response, and the protection of public health . Our initiatives have normally been above and beyond the regulatory mandated requirements.  While extensive efforts were taken back in June of 1999 to respond to the requirements of the Risk Management Plans, the unfortunate events of September 11, 2001, prompted us to re-visit our philosophy and approach towards emergency response.  WSSC invested in a large-scale emergency response plan upgrade project on June 30, 2003.  This project was primarily intended to meet the requirements of HR 3448, Title IV - Drinking Water, Security and Safety, Section 401 - Terrorist and Other Intentional Acts, contained in the \"Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.\" WSSC took this project to a higher elevation by updating all emergency response plans in accordance with the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (\"One Plan\").  Furthermore, while the Bioterrorism Act only required the WSSC to update our emergency response plans for drinking water treatment plants, WSSC took the initiative to update all emergency response plans for all wastewater treatment plants as well.  On September 29, 2003, the WSSC provided a Certification of Compliance of Integrated Contingency Plan with Requirements of Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 - Emergency Response Planning.

THE PRODUCTION TEAM\n\nThe Production Team provides continuous high quality cost effective operation and maintenance of the WSSC's water supply dams, reservoirs, water filtration plants, water distribution facilities, wastewater collection facilities, wastewater treatment plants, biosolids management programs and laboratories.\n\nOne of the Production Team's primary goals is to provide a safe and reliable supply of drinking water to our customers maintaining an adequate volume and pressure of water for fire-fighting and customer use that meets or exceeds the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act and other federal and state regulations.  The WSSC has never exceeded a maximum allowable contaminant level (MCL) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The Team is accomplishing this mission by maintaining and operating the Commission's raw water supply, dams, reservoirs, water filtration plants, and distribution system.  The two major water treatment plants, the Potomac and Patuxent Plants, operate in coordination with the distribution system and its various storage facilities, 65 tanks, and 13 pump stations to maximize water quality and customer satisfaction while minimizing costs.  All remote water pumping stations, storage tanks, and remote control pressure reducing stations are monitored and controlled through our supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.  These treatment and distribution systems utilize a combination of advanced process control and human intervention to meet ever increasing regulatory demands.\n\nThe second primary goal of the Production Team is to produce a quality effluent from its wastewater treatment plants which meets discharge standards to protect public health and environment.  This process begins with the operation and maintenance of portions of the WSSC wastew"

These facilities are remotely monitored by our SCADA system for proper operations to minimize overflows and protect equipment against damage.  Six wastewater treatment plants, Seneca, Damascus, Parkway, Western Branch, Piscataway, and Hyattstown, along with the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authorities (WASA) Blue Plains Plant provide wastewater treatment for WSSC's customers.  All of these wastewater treatment plants produce biosolids, the solids residuals removed from the wastewater during the treatment process.  The Production Team handles the biosolids beneficial reuse program.  \n\nAs this Team moves toward best practices, the continued and improved use of automation technology for process control and centralized control are critical to provide oversight and coordination with both the water and wastewater systems.  The use of this technology as a strategy allows automation and remote monitoring to support unstaffed or reduced staff operations and maintenance scheduling while maintaining a vigilant watch on these complicated systems.  \n\nA variety of support organizations exist within the Production Team.  Laboratory Services provides all laboratory testing and results necessary to operate the treatment processes including biological, organic and metals testing.  This laboratory data is utilized to optimize processes as well as meet the requirement of federal and state regulations.  The Laboratory also supports a variety of other teams within WSSC and performs laboratory work for other organizations.  The Production Team also provides coordination with numerous agencies regarding regional water supply, wastewater treatment and related issues.\n\nThe Production Team is responsible for providing overall supervision, management, coordination, and administration of the Water and Wastewater Groups.

The Team Chief provides the supervision, management, and administrative control of the Water and Wastewater and support Groups.\n\nVII. WESTERN BRANCH WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nWestern Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant is an advanced wastewater facility that serves an area of about 113 square miles in Prince George's County, Maryland.  This drainage basin includes parts of Bowie, Glenn Dale, and Largo in its northern sector and stretches down to Upper Marlboro in its southern sector.  The drainage basin has a population of approximately 150,000 people.  The plant processes over 7 billion gallons of wastewater a year, an average of over 20 million gallons a day.\nThe Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission built the Western Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant in the late 1960s.  It began treating wastewater in January of 1970 as a 5-million gallon per day (mgd) plant.  However, within a couple of years, it became evident that expansion and upgrading of the plant would be necessary due to rapidly increasing flows to the plant.  In 1973, the project that is today known as Phase I began.  Phase I was a new plant built west of the original 5-mgd plant.  It began operations in August of 1977.  It increased the capacity of the plant to treat 15 mgd of wastewater.  Phase I used biological treatment systems, clarifiers, polishing filters, and chlorine contact basins to treat the wastewater.  The solids taken out of the water were dewatered and then inci"

Further expansion was deemed necessary; so Phase II was built, which is an exact duplicate of Phase I.  It was built next to Phase I and increased the capacity of the plant to 30 mgd.  Phase II went into operation in April of 1980.\n\nUnder the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), the State of Maryland issues discharge permits to all state wastewater plants.  The regulations vary according to type, location, and size of the plant.  Over the last several years the Chesapeake Bay has been undergoing a major clean-up effort.  Part of the clean up involved the issuing of very stringent discharge permits to plants discharging into the Bay or into its tributaries.  The Western Branch discharge permit is one of the most limiting in the State of Maryland.  The treated water from this plant flows into the Western Branch, which flows into the Patuxent River.  The Patuxent River is the largest tributary flowing into the Chesapeake Bay that is wholly contained within the State of Maryland.\n\nWestern Branch is an advanced wastewater treatment plant because of its ability to remove large amounts of pollutants from the wastewater.  Some of the substances regulated at the Western Branch WWTP are Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Suspended Solids (SS), Phosphorous (P), Ammonia (NH3) and Total Nitrogen (N).  Western Branch WWTP has been highly efficient in removing these substances.  The plant regularly achieves 99% removal for BOD, SS, and NH3.  Also over 80% of Phosphorous is removed.  In addition, over 90% of Total Nitrogen is removed between April 1 and October 31 (as required by the permit) of each year.\n\nIn September of 1991, processes to provide nutrient removal (Phosphorous and Nitrogen) went into service.  Phosphorous and Nitrogen are substances that tend to promote excessive plant life.  The more plants grow, die off and sink, the more oxygen they take away from the water.  Subse"

Another problem with overabundance of nutrients is production of surface algae, which in turn interferes with sunlight reaching submerged aquatic vegetation.  The construction of the Nutrient Removal Processes at Western Branch was the first of its kind in this area.  The cost was approximately $38 million.  To assist with operating these processes, a computer monitoring and control system was provided.\n\nThe operators staff the plant around the clock, 7 days/week.  All operators must pass two written exams administered by the State of Maryland to be a licensed Wastewater Plant Operator.  The plant staffing, at all times, is a minimum of 2 operators.  The average years of experience for Western Branch operators are over 15 years.  Because of this well trained, experienced staff, very few emergencies are encountered due to preventive measures.  When an emergency or unusual situations develop, plant management is \"on call\" to the plant.  In addition, an Emergency Duty Engineer is available for assistance.  The Electrical/Mechanical and Instrumentation Technicians are also available on an \"on call\" basis to handle after normal work hours problems.\n\nThe plant is designed to provide reliable operations year round.  Power to the plant originates from two different electrical feeds, providing electrical redundancy and thereby reducing the potential occurrence of a total power outage.  In addition, a generator supplies power to the influent pumping station, providing another level of power redundancy. The plant is designed with redundant equipment at every phase of the treatment process.  Thus, when an equipment failure occurs, the process can continue producing a high quality final effluent and provide maximum protection to our environment.\n\nVIII.

The RMP requirement is essentially an expansion of the OSHA Process Safety requirement and the Employee and Community Right-to-Know programs that have been in existence for a number of years.\n\nHazardous material has always been recognized as a unique hazard for our employees and the public; therefore, we have made every possible effort to ensure the proper and safe use of all hazardous materials.  WSSC's Chemical Safety Prevention Program includes:  the availability of personal protective equipment; obtaining and use of the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS); designing facilities for safety and accident prevention; training and educating employees on chemical systems and processes; planning and practicing for emergency situations; requiring consultants and contractors to abide by established safety practices; sharing of information with employees, contractors and consultants; conducting periodic inspection and audit reviews of chemical process systems; and formulating policies and procedures for an effective chemical handling processes.\n\nWestern Branch places great emphasis on safety.  Everyone is taught safety first, and that no job can be completed without following proper safety procedures.  Extensive safety training is required of all employees.\nOperators must attend the following courses:\n\n? Self Contained Breathing Apparatus\n? Chlorine Repair Kit\n? Chlorine Leak Drill\n? CPR\n? Slips and Falls Prevention\n? Right-to-Know\n? Lockout/Tagout\n? Confined Space\n\nThese courses were developed by Production Team personnel, and are taught by the plant's Safety Coordinator.  Course content is a mixture of lecture, video, and hands-on training.  We recently studied the effectiveness of these courses, and determined that better instructor development coupled with more hands-on training would improve comprehension.  T"

Before becoming a Safety Coordinator, an operator must complete a 3-day training class.\n\nIn addition to conducting training classes, Safety Coordinators perform inspections, investigate accidents, conduct safety meetings, and correct plant safety problems.  The rotation of an operator/facility technician into Safety Coordinator position gets more operators directly involved in safety, promotes the concept of safety being everyone's job, and provides a fresh approach to safety.\n\nThe Plant Safety Program is a part of the overall WSSC Program.  WSSC safety professionals provide assistance on many safety matters.  They assist with developing training courses, investigating accidents, correcting unsafe conditions, providing physicals and random drug and alcohol tests for CDL drivers, and ensuring chemicals are handled properly.  Each year a safety specialist (in conjunction with the plant Safety Coordinator) performs a detailed inspection of the plant to ensure we meet all safety requirements.  All of the needed safety equipment is supplied by the WSSC.  This includes coveralls, rain suits, chemical-handling suits, hard hats, breathing apparatus, various types of gloves, eye protection equipment, manhole retrieval equipment, atmosphere testing meters, and well maintained vehicles.  Our position is that all needed safety equipment and training is provided to each employee.  Therefore, we accept no excuses for failure to work safely.\n\nThe Safety Program is clearly a success.  Accidents and injuries are at very low levels.  A plant record of 1,412 consecutive days without a lost-time accident was set recently.  The rare lost-time accident is usually minor, does not involve serious injury, and does not involve chemical handling.  Western Branch shines in another category.

Once again, training and an experienced staff are the keys to this success.\n\nManagement decided years ago that formal recognition of safe working employees was a good idea.  For each injury-free quarter, the plant receives an award.  For each injury-free year, the plant receives a plaque.  Individuals are also recognized.  Every two consecutive injury-free years are rewarded with a safety jacket or other safety incentives.  It is felt that recognition demonstrates the management commitment to safety.  The small amount of money spent on these recognitions is a cost saving to our overall prevention of accidents and injuries.\n\nThe employees of Western Branch are very proud of the plant's award winning performance.  Western Branch has received numerous Gold Awards from the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies.  The award signifies a perfect compliance record with the plant NPDES discharge permit.  The Chesapeake Bay Foundation designated Western Branch as Maryland's best wastewater treatment plant in 1987.  In 1989, 1991, and 1996, Western Branch received Operations and Maintenance Excellence Awards from EPA Region III.  EPA selected Western Branch for a National Award in 1997 for being the best large, advanced wastewater treatment plant in the country.  The plant also received a Governor's Award for Excellence for Biological Nutrient Removal efforts.  Because of the plant's excellent operating record, Western Branch has become a well known wastewater treatment plant.\n\nAdditionally, all Commission facilities are designed and built to conform with the industries recognized codes, such as:  National Electric Code, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American National Standards Institute, ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Codes, BOCA codes, American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Condition Engineers, American Water Works Association, etc.\n\nA review of the hazards associated with the chlorine and dechlorination processes and "
