North EPA ID 1000 0003 8112\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary for Submission\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons; including employee's that the Smithfield Farmland Corp. - North Facility is complying with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulation, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations, (CFR) 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  These regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In complying, we promote overall facility, employee and public safety.  Smithfield's program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness or death and to avoid the potential for property and environmental impact.  \n\n\n\nSmithfield's safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage handling or the on-site movement of chemicals.  Any groups of vessels interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  Smithfield has a policy and commitment to employee safety and it is expressed in all programs and training. \n\n\n\nSmithfield's safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on rules, procedures, and best practices which govern processes, activities, and/or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and revised as necessary; all information is communicated to employees of Smithfield through training and documentation.  The safety equipment used for HAZ-MAT purposes is inspected monthly and records are retained in the Refrigeration Supervisors "

There is no mitigation in use with the Worst Case Scenario.   \n\n\n\nSmithfield's accidental release prevention programs are based on safe work practices as referenced by the OSHA, EPA and American National Safety Standards (ANSI), and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) 2-1992 Key element of this prevention program are comprise of:\n\n    Equipment Design\n\n    Installation and Operation of Ammonia Process Systems (ANSI/IIAR 2)\n\n    Emergency Response and Action Plan Program (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120, 1910.38 and EPA 40 CFR Parts 68)\n\n    Mechanical Integrity\n\n    Emergency shut down procedures\n\n    Inspection program (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119)\n\n    \n\nSmithfield has experienced an accidental release over the past 5 (five) years, which occurred in October 2012. Improvements introduced as a result included revisions to maintenance.   \n\n\n\nThe facility emergency response program is based on OSHA's Regulation for Emergency Action Plans (1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  Smithfield has an on-site trained emergency response team (HAZMAT) and maintains a written emergency response plan which is reviewed annually.  This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Fire Department, Police and Emergency Medical facilities to ensure communication with all potential or actual involved resources should their involvement be necessitated by a release. \n\n\n\nThrough Process Hazard Analysis, inspections, annual reviews and audits, Smithfield continuously improves its process system, procedures, programs and training to ensure mitigation, control, technology, equipment and organizational changes remain consistent "
