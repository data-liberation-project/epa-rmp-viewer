      "SummaryText": "The City of Centralia Water Treatment Plant is located on the northern side of the City of Centralia, Illinois at 2219 Old 51 Road.  The plant is operated by the City by nine (9) employees that are assigned to the plant.  The risk management plan is the responsibility of the Utilities Superintendent, Perry White.  The plant uses typical water treatment chemicals to treat the water throughout the treatment process.  Chlorine is the only regulated substance that is used that is over the RMP threshold limit.  The maximum amount of chlorine that would be on site at any one time is five (5) one ton cylinders, or ten thousand (10,000) pounds.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been updated in June of 2009 along with the RMP plan 5 year anniversary.\n\nChemical safety is important to the operators at the plant.  The operators have been trained regarding the handling of hazardous chemicals and are aware of the consequences of an accidental release.  The facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the City of Centralia Fire Department.  The one ton chlorine cylinders repair kit is kept by the City of Centralia Fire Department (west side engine house) and it will be made available to the repair contactor if required.  If a chlorine release event would occur the City will use the contractor, Freeman Environmental Services to repair the leak.\n\nThe City of Centralia Water Treatment Plant has not had an accidental release of chlorine in the past 5 years.  This can be attributed to the training and diligence that the operators use when changing the chlorine cylinders, and the ongoing inspection and maintenance of the chlorine distribution equipment.\n\nThe worst case scenario has been developed for the plant using EPA RMP comp calculations.  The worst case model was based on a 2,000 pound release of chlorine which involves a cylinder at full capacity.  This 2,000 pound release would affect a 1.3 mile radius if the wind currents carry the gas southerly or westerly int"

      "SummaryText": "o the urban topography of the City of Centralia.  The 2,000 pound release will affect a 3.0 mile radius if the wind currents carry the gas northerly or easterly into the rural topography of Marion County.  The population affected by the worst case release could affect as many as 14,000 residents in the City of Centralia and neighboring Marion and Clinton Counties.  Public receptors include schools, the hospital, churches, residences, commercial buildings, and industrial buildings.   Environmental receptors include the Centralia Reservoir, Foundation Park, Crooked Creek, Turkey Creek, and the ditch along the railroad tracks adjacent to the Water Treatment Plant.  The one ton chlorine cylinders are stored in a secure room at the plant, but this was not calculated in as a passive mitigation system.\n\nThe alternate release scenario has been developed for the plant using EPA RMP comp calculations.  The effected are would be a 0.1 mile radius from the point of release.  The alternate model was based on a 400 pound release of chlorine over sixty (60) minutes, or a release rate of 6.7 pounds per minute. Public receptors include nearby residences.  Environmental receptors include the ditch along the railroad tracks adjacent to the Water Treatment Plant.  The one ton chlorine cylinders and chlorine metering equipment are stored in a secure room at the plant, this was calculated as a passive mitigation system for this alternate scenario.\n\nDaily inspections of all chorine equipment at the Water Treatment Plant is part of the accidental release prevention program.  These inspections are carried out by skilled operators and any repairs are made as required from the inspections.  The facility is also equipped with two (2) chlorine leak detectors, one in the chlorine storage room and the other in the chlorine feed room.  These detectors have both a visual and audible alarm that function if a leak is detected.  When the one ton chlorine tanks are changed the operators work in teams.\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nThe emergency response plan for the City of Centralia Water Treatment Plant has been coordinated with the local emergency responders. The City of Centralia Fire Department is the lead agency in charge of the situation.  The emergency response plan is intended to provide direction in case of an accidental release of chlorine to both the plant operators and the emergency responders.  The plan also includes phone numbers and contact information for all responding agencies and contractors, as well as contact numbers for all employees of the water treatment plant.  The plan includes guidance on sheltering the affected public receptors and residences.  The plan also includes training and simulated drill frequency.\n\nThe City of Centralia Water Treatment Plant is committed to safe handling of all chemicals, including chlorine, in order to supply the City of Centralia and outlying customers with drinkable water.   In the event of an accidental release of chlorine, the City of Centralia Water Treatment Plant has developed the emergency response plan to properly carry out all activities of treating the release and keeping the public, operators, and emergency responders safe. \n"
