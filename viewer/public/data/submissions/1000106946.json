There is a process in place for the management team to review all potential process changes, including recommendations following process hazard analysis and compliance audits.  \n\nBG Products has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility. We believe that, due to the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation and our commitment to continuous improvement, an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."

However, the BG Products is required to comply with the requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of flammable or explosive chemicals codified under the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119). The required elements of the PSM program relevant to general accidental release prevention are listed below:\n-\tEmployee Participation\n-\tProcess Safety Information\n-\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n-\tOperating Procedures\n-\tContractors\n-\tPre-startup Safety Review\n-\tMechanical Integrity\n-\tHot Work Permit\n-\tManagement of Change\n-\tIncident Investigation\n-\tEmergency Planning and Response\n-\tCompliance Audits\n-\tTrade Secrets\nBG Products has a program in place to comply with these items and their specific requirements.\nT\nhe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe distribution center has had no accidents meeting the definition in 40 CFR 68.42 in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nAs a non-responding site, BG Products has developed a written emergency action plan (EAP) that includes activation of the local emergency notification system and calling 911 from a safe location, and directing an evacuation, including exit route assignments.

      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\n\nBG Products is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. BG Products is considered a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nBG Products owns and operates a warehouse located in El Dorado, Kansas. The distribution center houses various products including flammables in aerosol cans. All of the aerosol cans containing RMPregulated chemicals are stored in the warehouse flammable room in full pallet format. These aerosols contain propellants that include flammable substances that are subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements as a flammable mixture. There is no bulk (drum, tote, tank) storage or chemical processing operations at the site. The regulated chemicals at the BG Products Distribution Center consist of aerosol propellants and include the following:\n\n  -  Butane (CAS #106-97-8), and\n  -  Propane (CAS #74-98-6).\n\nThe maximum intended inventory is conservatively calculated based on every storage location full of the highest weight of the flammable product in the flammable room. The BG Products Distribution Center is eligible for the RMP Program Level 1 because the facility has not had a reportable release in the previous five years, the distance to the flammable endpoint for a worst-case release is less than the distance to any public receptor, and the facility has coordinated response efforts with the local emergency planning and response agencies.
