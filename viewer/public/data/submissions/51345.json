The reason for submitting this RMP is to comply with the mandatory five years update and to report the change of ownership from ConAgra Poultry Company to Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation.  This facility has one ammonia refrigeration systems with inventories above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia on this system has not changed since the last RMP plan submitted in December 1999, and no significant additional controls have been added to the process.\n\nPilgrim\u00bfs Pride Chattanooga Further Processing Plant recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel and the neighboring community are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the facility.\n\nPilgrim's Pride Corporation is committed to the safety of its employees, the surrounding communities, and the environment in which its plants operate.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration process equipment.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions of the plant HAZMAT Team with the Chattanooga Fire Department.  This is achieved by ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation and by getting the members of the Fire Department acquainted with the facility.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US"

These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for the Chattanooga Further Processing facility site, including consideration of ammonia release scenarios as \u00bfworst case release\u00bf and \u00bfalternative release scenarios\u00bf. We do have several active mitigation systems to minimize any effect incidents like these would have.  We also incorporate several management systems to decrease the likelihood of this incident occurring.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\u00b7  Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners.\n.  Preventative maintenance programs.\n.  Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners.\n\u00b7  Performance of process hazard analyses of the entire system including equipment and piping.\n\u00b7  Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\u00b7  Procedure for handling all changes to the system.\n\u00b7  Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications.\n\u00b7  Up-to-date process safety information.\n\u00b7  Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses.\n\u00b7  Hot-work permits for work on or near the ammonia process.\n\u00b7  Line Break procedures.\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.

The Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance of the refrigeration equipment.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system, as required under the regulations.  Chemical-specific exposure prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and air purifying respirators for the refrigeration partners, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.  We also give our refrigeration partners HAZWOPER training on an annual basis.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, the Company performs periodical audits and hazard reviews to enhance continued safe performance.  Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked regularly for timely completion as required.\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  This program has been coordinated with the Chattanooga Fire Department.\n\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:\nOrganization Plan and Responsibilities.\nCommunications Procedures.\nDetailed Action Plans.\nFirst Aid Procedures.\nEmergency Medical Treatment Procedures.\nEvacuation Plans.\nDescription of Outside Assistance Available.\nSite Re-Entry Procedures.\nTraining Programs and Drills."
