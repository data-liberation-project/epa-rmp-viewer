      "SummaryText": "The Central Bi-Products facility located in Long Prairie, Minnesota is a rendering facility and provides products for the pet food industry that handles ammonia and chlorine, which is considered toxic by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to provide a service to the animal and poultry processing facilities by taking non-edible bi-products and processing by protein conversion into useful products.  The process includes grinding, fluidizing evaporation and additional processes.  Also, fresh poultry is prepared, cooled or frozen, and shipped for use as pet food.\n\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain a safe storage and processing of products used for animal feeds.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the products being handled.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility.\n\nChlorine is used as an oxidizer in odor control systems within the facility.  Chlorine is widely accepted for these applications.  Chlorine is stored in steel cylinders and is conveyed through a vacuum piping system within the facility to points of use.  If the vacuum system fails, the system automatically shuts down to prevent further release.\n\nSince ammonia and chlorine are classified by EPA as toxic chemicals, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, and chlorine, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our contractors and personnel.\n\nAn accidental rel"

The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and complies with state codes.  This processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using an on the job training program. Our refrigeration contractors are members of IIAR, a nationally recognized authority in ammonia refrigeration.  This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program, including using the services of an independent refrigeration contractor to assist in the operation and maintenance of the facility, and employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  The facility has a plan to replace Safety Relief Valves on a 5-year interval as recommended by IIAR.  The vessels containing ammonia are located inside the building which lessens the impact of any ammonia release from a vessel.\n\nThe chlorine system is set up according to the guidelines and recommendation of the Chlorine Institute.  The cylinders are delivered on a routine basis by a reliable firm and the system as previously mentioned operated on a vacuum system connected to the pressurized tank.  Any damage to the system where a pipe is opened to the atmosphere, the valve at the cylinder automatically closes.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Long Prairie Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response.  Representatives of the Long Prai"
