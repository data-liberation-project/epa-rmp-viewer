This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nBrief description of the stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nThe  Equistar Chemicals Bayport Plant is located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Pasadena, Texas, approximately 25 miles east-southeast  of the City of Houston. Equistar Chemicals owns and  operates three  basically identical polypropylene manufacturing units at  the  Bayport  facility.  These  systems  produce  mainly homopolymer  with some copolymer production capability.  The loop  reactors  in  this  process  are  fed  with  the  main feedstock,  propylene,  as  well as  smaller  quantities  of ethylene,  donor,  catalyst and mineral oils.  Polypropylene polymer is then formed and passes through a steamer to strip residual  hydrocarbons.  A nitrogen dryer is used to  remove any  remaining moistu"

Ethylene, propylene, and butene are the main feedstocks to the reactor depending on the desired type of product. Smaller quantities of  catalyst  donor and mineral oil are also  added  to  the reactors.  The  resulting polymers formed pass  through  the steamer  and  dryer,  and the finished product  goes  to  an extruder  for  pelletizing with some  being  loaded  out  as flake.\nThe polymer is used as a raw material by other companies  to produce  vehicle  bumpers, home sidings,  medical  syringes, shatter-proof packaging that is child safe, bicycle helmets, food  plastic  wrap & containers, disposable  baby  diapers, yarn for clothes and carpets, and tools.\n\nThe Equistar Chemicals Bayport plant employs 222  people. The plant property  is approximately 213 acres, 165 of which  is  used for the manufacturing activities.\n\nBrief description of the general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\nThe  Equistar Chemicals Bayport Plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nThe  Equistar Chemicals Bayport Plant maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nThe  Equistar Chemicals Bayport Plant conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled efficiently.

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar Chemicals Bayport Plant maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining:\nThe  Equistar Chemicals Bayport Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive in-depth training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided as needed, but at a minimum of every three years. The training program is periodically reviewed to implement improvements. \n\nMechanical Integrity:\nThe  Equistar Chemicals Bayport Plant carries out documented maintenance checks to ensure process equipment is functioning properly. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among other; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
