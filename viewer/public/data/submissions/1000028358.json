This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal.  \r\n\r\n* Harford Mills Terminal has recently completed a layer of protection analysis (LOPA) to determine if additional controls are needed to improve the reliability of specific emergency response controls in an effort to further reduce the possibility of an unexpected release.\r\n* Enterprise is currently in the process of reviewing and revising the entire safety management / accident prevention program to ensure that the program can be fully administered across the diverse nature of the facilities owned or operated by the company."

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.

The propane (or butane) is received from an Enterprise underground pipeline or in rail tank cars and is stored in any of seven above ground storage tanks or in the underground storage caverns.  The stored LPG is transferred into highway transport trucks or rail tank cars for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the truck filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection.  A small ethyl mercaptan storage tank is on site to provide mercaptan inventory, but the amount of odorant stored at the terminal is below the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation.  The facility also has a 12-spot railcar loading and unloading rack that can be used for the receipt or delivery of propane or butane by pressurized tank cars, as noted above.\r\n\r\nThe Harford Mills Terminal was evaluated to determin"

Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal uses Enterprise software-based change appro"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented to ensure that the safety of the facility is not compromised by the change.  Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on any changes as part of the change management process.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit of the program to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program"
