The Facility Policy\n\n     The Board of Directors, management, and employees of United Ag Service Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n  2. Facility Information.\n\n     - The primary activity at the facility is the receipt, storage, and distribution of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n\n     - The maximum quantity stored would be 120,000 pounds in one 15,000 gallon storage tank and one 12,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck holding 48,000 pounds.\n\n  3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 66,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.76 miles.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n  4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n  5. The five-year accident histo"

The emergency response program.\n\n     - The facility has:\n\n     a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information\n         as required by SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n     c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120,\n         including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n  7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
