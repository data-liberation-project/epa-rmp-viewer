This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance safe work procedures are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent recurrence of an incident.\n-\tInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements with any action items tracked to completion.\n-\tAn annual dialogue with the Upton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) will ensure a readiness to respond to potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops."

There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  \n\nWTG has determined that BGP is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the RMP regulation because the nearest public receptor is within the worst-case scenario flammable endpoint radius and additionally the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency planning and response program in place at the facility include:\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility, operator training and intervention. \n\nPrevention Program\nThe BGP is operating under a prevention program that involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.

WTG\u0092s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, and emergency planning and response in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and continuous improvement efforts to improve safety at the facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nWTG owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located near Midkiff, Texas.  The Benedum Gas Plant (BGP) compresses and treats natural gas to produce residue gas (methane) and natural gas liquids (NGL).  Gas enters the plant through either a high- or low-pressure inlet system.  Low-pressure gas is compressed and sent through amine treatment to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide; the resulting waste gas is burned off using a flare.  Amine-treated gas is then mixed with the high-pressure inlet gas and flows through a molecular sieve gas dehydrator to remove water.  The gas then flows to a cryogenic unit that separates out NGL, which leaves the BGP via pipeline.  The remaining gas is compressed and leaves the plant via pipeline.\n \nField (unstabilized) condensate is delivered to the BGP via tank truck and stored in two roof storage tanks.  Emissions that occur during unloading are controlled by a dedicated tank farm flare.  Field condensate is fed into a gun-barrel tank for initial three-phase separation.  Gas produce"
