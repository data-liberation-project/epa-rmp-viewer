When we added a new solids plant to our Winnemucca, Nevada facility in 2019, we expanded our Safety Culture to cover the processes and workflows needed for solids production. OSHA's Process Safety Management and NDEP-CAPP programs are implemented by Cyanco and add another layer of operational oversight. In addition, Cyanco is a signatory to, and certified under the guidelines of, the International Cyanide Management Code (ICMC), a voluntary set of safety standards and practices for cyanide production, transportation, and use by the gold and silver mining industry.\r\nThe plans and programs we have enacted at our production facility serve our overarching goal of providing quality products to our customers in the safest and most efficient manner possible. Along with programs to provide the best quality sodium cyanide to gold and silver customers, Cyanco is committed to ensure the high hazards chemicals handled on site are not accidentally release resulting in activation of an emergency response protocol.  The highly hazardous chemical in Cyanco Winnemucca's focus is anhydrous ammonia.  Cyanco's policies associated with minimizing the potential for accidental release center around mechanical integrity of the handling system, training of our personnel to report even a very minor leak of ammonia through our incident investigation program, and training of our emergency response team to respond to these minor releases.  \r\nCyanco is also responsible for the safe handling of raw materials and components that go into our finished products, such as anhydrous ammonia. Cyanco's use of that material requires us to submit a Risk M"

      "SummaryText": "anagement Plan.  Cyanco's stationary sources that contain anhydrous ammonia are railcars used to deliver ammonia to the Winnemucca facility when connected to the system piping for introduction into the process.  Additional stationary sources utilized by Cyanco in our handling of anhydrous ammonia are two liquid ammonia filters, two ammonia vaporizers, two ammonia super heaters, two gaseous ammonia filters, two gaseous preheaters, two reactors, two neutralization mixers and disengagement vessels, and three thermal oxidizers that are all linked to the production of sodium cyanide and use anhydrous ammonia for production.  Cyanco has completed a regulated chemical review for all process chemicals used in the production of sodium cyanide and has found that anhydrous ammonia is the only chemical that meets the RMP requirement.\r\nThe Risk Management Program is another building block in Cyanco's safe operations.  As a participant in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program, Cyanco has a solid foundation for safe operations.  The PSM program requires the formal evaluation of specific design and operational hazards before the startup of any new process.  Cyanco has performed extensive Process Hazard Analyses on each area of the covered process portion of the facility.  These reviews allow the scrutiny of every operation performed at the plant.  Areas where hazards were identified have been promptly addressed.  The PSM program requires written operating procedures on each critical or hazardous task.  Operation and maintenance personnel are properly trained on their jobs and the hazards involved with the process.  \r\nCyanco also has a program in place to ensure that each piece of equipment is designed properly and is operating according to its design.  The Mechanical Integrity program includes periodic testing and inspection of vessels, safety devices and instruments to ensure safe operation. Cyanco's facility is designed and operated using sophisticated process control eq"

If the process deviates from normal operating conditions, the entire operation is designed to shut down within seconds without endangering personnel or releasing hazardous materials into the environment.  Process instrumentation and control equipment have been designed to protect both personnel and the public in the event of a process upset.  \r\nCyanco has also made use of the Internet to improve the availability and accuracy of plant policies and procedures.  Computers at the facility have access to the most current documents at the plant through this electronic document control system.  These efforts all help ensure the continued safe operation of every aspect of Cyanco's facility.\r\nCyanco has an excellent safety record.  No releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in serious onsite or offsite consequences have occurred in the 31-year history of the plant.  This record is a credit to the facility design and training and dedication of plant personnel. As such, Cyanco has not had an accidental anhydrous ammonia release that has caused a fatality, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage either on or offsite in the past 5 years.\r\nPersonnel have been trained to recognize and respond to any potential incident at the facility. Cyanco's Emergency Response Program uses simple step-by-step forms to guide personnel through the appropriate response to a chemical release, natural disaster, fire, medical emergency, or explosion. Cyanco has a well-trained Emergency Response Team with each member trained in Confined Space Rescue, rope rescue, emergency medical responder, and HAZWOPER technician responder level. In the event of an emergency, personnel are trained to alert the entire staff to the problem using the plant alarm and paging system.

In the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, Cyanco's personnel are trained to investigate the release, determine it impact to personnel, the facility, the community, and the environment.  This investigation is designed to prevent recurrence of the incident and provide learnings to improve safety of the facility.  Linked to this investigation is the post-accident critique that is used to evaluate the efficacy of the emergency response and what actions are needed to improve response and the overall safety of the responders.\r\nOperations personnel can shut down process operations if deemed necessary. Safety equipment at the plant allows for a safe response to each emergency.  Safety equipment includes first aid kits, chemical detection devices, air purifying respirators, chemical resistant clothing, supplied air and self-contained breathing apparatuses, rope rescue equipment, and confined space rescue equipment.  Regular training and drills ensure that each site employee can make decisions and help reduce potential hazards posed by operation of this facility.\r\nCyanco is continually evaluating policies and training materials to ensure the best possible programs are in place.  New technology and techniques are examined regularly and implemented if found valuable.  Cyanco's incident investigations have provided opportunities to improve how personnel are trained in accident response.  These investigations have also provided opportunities to improve operating procedures to reduce and eliminate the likelihood of a repeat event including releases of the highly hazardous chemicals."
