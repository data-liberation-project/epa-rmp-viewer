      "SummaryText": "The Lisburne Production Center (LPC) is classified as NAICS code 211111, Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas Production.  Prior applicability analysis performed by an earlier operator of LPC demonstrated that the facility was not covered by RMP, due to the A?naturally occurring hydrocarbonA? exemption. While BP Exploration Alaska Inc. (BPXA) concurs with that analysis, a Program 1 plan for the propane refrigeration process is being submitted.\n\n\n\nDescription of  stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nLPC processes crude oil production fluids received from various crude oil accumulations (collectively known as the Greater Pt. McIntyre area or GPMA) located on the North Slope of Alaska, including (but not limited to) Lisburne, Point McIntyre, Niakuk, West Beach State, and North Prudhoe Bay State.  Production fluids consist mainly of crude oil, hydrocarbon gas, and water.  Crude oil is processed to remove hydrocarbon gas and water in order to meet specific crude oil sales specifications.  Sales oil then enters the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.  Hydrocarbon gas is dehydrated, stripped of butane and heavier hydrocarbons that may be present, and compressed for re-injection into the reservoirs or used as fuel.  Water is processed to remove entrained crude oil before injection into disposal or injector wells.  \n\n\n\nLPC utilizes propane in a dry gas refrigeration system.  The propane refrigeration system is a closed circulating loop.  Liquid propane is generally prepared on site at LPC and added to the surge drum as needed.  The propane system consists of the following equipment and approximate inventories:\n\n\n\nA?    The 42-1242 propane accumulator/surge drum provides liquid propane storage.  At normal operating level, the surge drum contains approximately 2,247 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 9,478 lbs.\n\nA?    Two vessels facilitate compression of propane refrigerant in multiple stages, which improves overall system efficiency: \n\no    At normal operating level, the 42-1343 interstage flash"

The 42-1359 and 42-1314 chillers provide for heat exchange between incoming process natural gas and propane refrigerant.  At normal operating level, each chiller contains approximately 4,300 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 18,138 lbs.  Catastrophic loss of inventory from a chiller is the basis for the Worst Case Scenario calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal propane inventory onsite is approximately 54,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nCatastrophic loss of inventory of the 42-1359 propane chiller is the basis for the Worst Case Scenario calculations.  The model used was a TNT Equivalent Calculation.\n\n\n\nOther Information Required Per 40 CFR 68.155:\n\n\n\nLPCA?s accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are predicated on compliance with OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps include process hazard analysis (PHA) and layer of protection analysis (LOPA).  The facility has had no accidents in the past five years from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  The emergency response program was developed consistent with OSHAA?s Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) and PSM standards, as well as other applicable regulations.  Planned changes to improve safety occur through an internal continual improvement processes. \n\n\n\nEnclosed modules which house process equipment operated at LPC are equipped with fire suppression systems.  In the event of fire, HalonA?1 fire suppressant is automatically released to inhibit the chemical reaction of combustion and extinguish the flames.  \n\n\n\nPrudhoe Bay has its own professionally-train"
