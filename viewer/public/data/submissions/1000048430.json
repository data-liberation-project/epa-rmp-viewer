The regulated substance, aqua ammonia (ammonium hydroxide), a 28-30% solution of ammonia and water, is stored on site for use in making fertilizer.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThis facility complies with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Minnesota Department of Agriculture regulations for the storage and handling of ammonium hydroxide. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and to take additional steps necessary to prevent releases from occurring. Should an accidental release occur, it is our policy to contact the Minnesota Duty Officer to report the incident and request any needed assistance, and to notify the National Response Center in the event of a release of a CERCLA RQ material. Conklin has contracted with a private spill contractor, should a major spill occur that is beyond the capabilities of Conklin's Emergency Response Team to safely handle.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe Prevention Program has several components. It includes information on the regulated chemical, process technology, and the equipment involved. A process hazard analysis was used to identify hazards. Operating procedures describe the steps necessary for safely handling ammonium hydroxide from itA?s being received to its use in production. Operator training and contractor requirements help to ensure the safe handling of ammonium hydroxide and process equipment. Written procedures, equipment inspection and testing, quality assurance, and the training of maintenance personnel are completed to ensure the mechanical integrity of the system. A policy is in place to manage changes to the system to ensure they are reviewed for safety before implementation.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nWe have never had an acciden"

A contract is in place with a local chemical spill response contractor. Conklin's employee Emergency Response Team (ERT) is trained to respond to emergency situations. A team member is assigned to notify and communicate with the Minnesota Duty Officer, the spill contractor, and outside agencies in the event of an emergency release. ERT training consists of spill response, release-reporting requirements, air sampling equipment, personal protective equipment, emergency response procedures, first aid and CPR, and more.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe aqua ammonia storage tank, containment dike, and storage building were all newly constructed and installed in 1998 in compliance with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Minnesota Department of Agriculture rules and regulations. No new changes are planned."
