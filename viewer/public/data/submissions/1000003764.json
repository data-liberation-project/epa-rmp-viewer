The Company's officers, managers, and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the Company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Michael Foods, Inc. has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing, and reporting such releases.  The Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nMichael Foods, Inc. processes egg products.  To prevent contamination with harmful bacteria and to freeze the final product, ammonia is used.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in the various stages of the process.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMichael Foods, Inc. has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The company has aggressively developed programs, policies, and materials requirements to minimize the possibility of releases.  These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high level awareness when working with hazardous materials.\n"

This method includes periodic evaluation of the Program utilizing a Process Hazard Analysis and Compliance Audits. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nMichael Foods, Inc. has not had an accidental release as defined in 40 CFR 68.42(a) during the last five years.   \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nOn-site emergency response teams train to respond to releases to effectively minimize the release.  Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e. fire, police, rescue, etc.). Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams and annually with outside organizations.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nFuture changes to improve release prevention include:  improved maintenance procedures and periodicity; addition of new technology as it becomes available; and continued training of plant and response personnel."
