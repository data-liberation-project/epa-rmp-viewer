Valence is committed to providing and maintaining a safe and healthy environment for all employees, customers, partners, contractors, suppliers and members of the public.\n\n\n\nValence is committed to reduce the potential for unsafe situations by developing, implementing and maintaining an Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response Programs and works with the local community.\n\n\n\nThe Valence Mobile Flare Gas Capture (FGC-003) Tailgunner facility is tied closely with it partner ConocoPhillips Tailgunner facility. The Valence facility is composed of one process located at the ConocoPhillips Tailgunner Facility, within the plant boundary.\n\n\n\nThe facility captures ConocoPhillips flare gas and recovers natural gas liquids. This facility recovers primarily propane although may contain small quantities of ethane or butane.\n\n\n\nValence Mobile FGC-003 Tailgunner facility went into operation in March of 2021. The Valence FGC-003 Tailgunner facility has had no process related accidents in its history.\n\n\n\nValence has a developed emergency response plan for this site. The first level of response is engineered safety systems e.g., equipment shuts downs due to vibration, levels or pressures or gas detection all which shuts down the equipment in a safe state. Where incidents may escape from engineered designs, they are managed by engineered mitigation systems e.g., pressure safety reliefs or relief systems to the shared flare. If an emergency were ever to extend beyond these cases, Valence works with ConocoPhillips to protect workers through evacuation plans.\n\n\n\nValence has identified that most scenarios identified within the modelling are very unlikely either requiring a sudden and complete failure of a vessel or a pool fire beneath one. To ensure these are not credible, Valence maintains a vessel and mechanical integrity program for equipment. Sloping of the yard has been eng"

ESD stations at truck loading.\n\n\n\nWith these controls and systems in place, Valence believes that it poses little risk to workers or the environment due to process safety incidents.\n\n"
