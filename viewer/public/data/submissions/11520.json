      "SummaryText": "e RMP rule also requires that companies develop alternative release scenarios based on more credible release assumptions. \n\nAlternative release scenarios differ from worst-case scenarios in several important ways.  They may be based on actual incident history or on events which are more likely to occur, and allow the use of both active and passive mitigation to reduce the potential impact of a release on the community outside the facility.\n\nEPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Tables were used for evaluating the consequences of the WCS and ARS for both regulated flammable and toxic materials.  Use of these tables resulted in the determination of a release endpoint distance. The EPA-recommended LANDVIEW program was used to estimate the number of people potentially affected in each scenario.  The West Virginia Kanawha/Putnam County Emergency Services Maps and CD-ROM Program were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within the scenario endpoint distance.\n\nAccording to the RMP rule, the release endpoint distance is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected for each scenario.  It is intended to ensure that potential risks to the public health are recognized.  For toxic releases, the endpoint is the distance beyond which chemical concentrations are low enough that an average individual could be exposed for up to one hour without suffering irreversible or debilitating health effects.   For flammable releases, the endpoint distance is that distance beyond which the community would be subject to a pressure wave of less than 1 psi resulting from the formation of an exploding vapor cloud.  Below this value little or no impact to the community is expected.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst case and alternative case scenarios in our facility Risk Management Plans.

In 1998, Lyondell acquired the assets of ARCO Chemical Company (ACC), including the facilities in South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia.  These facilities are located within the existing Union Carbide Corporation's South Charleston plant, and within the Rhone-Poulenc plant in Institute. Also included in this acquisition were urethanes research and development facilities located within the Union Carbide South Charleston Technical Center.\n\nWorldwide, the Lyondell enterprise operates in 15 countries, has approximately 11,000 employees, and consists of businesses with more than $17 billion in assets.  In West Virginia, Lyondell directly employs about 135 people and provides employment for about 135 people under contract from Union Carbide and Rhone-Poulenc. \n\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nThe Lyondell enterprise produces quality chemicals, polymers, and refined petroleum products that form the basis for plastics and synthetics of all kinds.  Products made from these materials fill the supermarket shelves and go into automobiles, housing, clothing and other necessities that improve the quality of life by making products safer, healthier and more convenient.\n\nThe products made at our West Virginia facilities belong to a family of chemicals called polyether polyols, and are derived from a chemical called propylene oxide, which is supplied by other Lyondell plants on the Gulf Coast. Polyols are used primarily in polyurethane foams for products ranging from bedding and furniture, to automotive applications such as seat\ncushions and energy absorbing instrument panels and side panels.

Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management Program rule requires that covered stationary sources handling regulated substances conduct off-site consequence analyses (OCA) to evaluate the potential off-site impact of a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) for each regulated toxic chemical on site.  RMP also requires covered sources to evaluate one worst-case scenario and one alternative release scenario for a single chemical representing the class of flammables.  \n\nAll of these scenarios are developed using guidelines established in the RMP rule.  In developing worst-case scenarios, companies must presume the release of the entire quantity of the largest container of a regulated chemical over a 10-minute period.  Only passive mitigation systems, such as those that do not require energy or action by an employee to initiate can be considered.  U.S. EPA acknowledges that these worst-case scenarios are unlikely to occur, so th"
