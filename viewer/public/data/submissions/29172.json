Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of United Suppliers, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale Retail Agriculture Dealers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and blended into liguid grade fertilizers.  This blending operation normally takes place for approximatly a week in the early spring and a week in the late fall. this blending operation is preformed by a T-Reactor.  The T-Reactor is a process of combing anhydrous ammonia, phosphorous and water.  Phosphorous is supplied as wet-process superphosphoric acid.  The standard grades produced by this process are 10-34-00 and 11-37-00.  The maximum quantity of anhyrous ammonia on hand during the blending operation would be approximately 130,000 pounds. \n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.12 miles.  \n\nb. The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-o"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.78  miles.  \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The State of Iowa Administrative Code, Chapter 43, Fertilizers and Agricultural Lime, 21-43.6 (200).  The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6. Emergency Action Program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\n  a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n  b. provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III   (EPCRA);\n\n c. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n             1. Within 15 minutes of determining that the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the  Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\n             The National Emergency Response Center @ 800-424-8802\n\n             2. Immediately (within one hour) after determining that the amount of release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n   \n             The State Spill Reporting Agency @ 515-281-8883 (day phone) or \n              515-281-8694 (after hours phone).\n\n7.
