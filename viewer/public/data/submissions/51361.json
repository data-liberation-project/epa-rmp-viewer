      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\n1.   The Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of the Princeton Water Treatment Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of chlorine or hydrogen fluoride by utilization of proper equipment, fire prevention, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with the chemicals.  Should an accident occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.   Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is Water Treatment and in conjunction with this operation, the handling, storage, and use of 1) chlorine for disinfection of water and 2) fluorosilicic acid for fluorination of water.  \n\nChlorine gas is received, stored and used for water disinfection. \n\nFluorosilicic acid is received, stored and used for fluorination of water.  Fluorosilicic acid is not a regulated chemical under 40 CFR 68, but has been included because hydrogen fluoride is a decomposition product of fluorosilicic acid at 227oF.\n\n3.   The Worst-case Scenario: would be the release of the total contents of a storage container released based on the maximum quantity of chlorine stored and fluorosilicic acid stored at the plant.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of dispersion is based on the RMP*Comp V1.07 model.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario for chlorine is assumed to be a release from the rupture of container (or line).  The alternative case release scenario for hydrogen fluoride is assumed to be a release from the rupture of container. Both the chlorine and fluorisilicic acid storage rooms are enclosed and the models include mitigation by the enclosure. \n\n4.
