Consequently, the City forward a copy of the original RMP in question to the EPA on Friday, June 23, 2006; along with a copy of the disk that was provided to the City of Houston by Turn Collins & Braden Inc.\nUpon receipt of the copy, Mrs. Carrion further advised Prentiss Watkins, Senior Project Manager of the City?s Compliance Group, although the City correctly provide the EPA with the information requested: the disk that the consultant gave the City is not in the proper format.\n?    As a result Mrs. Carrion is requesting that the City of Houston provide another disk copy of the Ridgemont Plant RMP using the RMP*Submit 2004TM.  \n?    In addition, Mrs. Carrion advised the City to change applicable sections of the Ridgemont Plant RMP since contact information originally provided to Turner Collins & Braden Inc. for the 2004 RMP submittal has changed.  Consequently, the following sections of the Ridgemont RMP has been updated:  \n?    1.6 Owner or Operator\n?    1.7 Name and title of person or position responsible for Part 64 RMP implementation\n?    1.8 Emergency Contact\n?    1.9 Other points of contact\n?    8.8 Compliance audits \n[Note that these updated have also been made to satisfy EPA requirements found in chapter 6 and chapter 7, of the EPA?s ?RMP*Submit 2004TM User Manual.?]\n?    As a result, the City restates that the ?Executive Summary ? is being re-submitted: but not changed, to satisfy all software requirements.\n?
