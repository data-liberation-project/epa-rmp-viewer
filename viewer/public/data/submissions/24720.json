The Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Eldon C. Stutsman, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Johnson County LEPC, local FD and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application as fertilizer for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored, 2.0 million lbs.,  includes our main storage tanks, nurse tanks, and railroad cars waiting for use.  The railroad cars are on site approximately 2 times per year for a period of one week. Approximately 613,407 lbs of anhydrous ammonia is the amount that would be on site the remainder of the year. This amount includes our main storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 200,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint is 5.0 miles.\nb. The most likely alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The maximum quantity release would be 27,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint is 0.7 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of  \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1,\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\" \n\n5. The Five-year Accident History."

The emergency action plan.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910. 38:\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to -know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nc. Johnson County LEPC phone number is (319) 626-3990.\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
