              "Description": "Based on the Reddy Ice-East Point (321) facility ammonia inventory, location, and requirement to meet OSHA PSM standards, it has been determined the facility is subject to Accident Prevention Program 3 requirements. The facility has developed a Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program to address the accident prevention program requirements of both the OSHA and EPA regulations. The purpose of the PSM/RM Program is to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. The PSM/RM Prevention Program contains thirteen elements, coordinated through a management system to ensure development, implementation, and integration of the Program requirements. These thirteen elements consist of the following:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review Program, Standard Operating Procedures, Training, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Contractor Qualifications, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\nReddy Ice corporate management and Reddy Ice-East Point management are committed to operating safe and compliant facilities for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include continuous and emergency engine room ventilation, pressure safety relief valves that discharge to a water-filled neutralization tank, failsafe controls that shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and computerized PLC controls allowing the entire system to be shut down remotely if required. Ammonia detection units/alarms are installed throughout the building to notify employees or offsite personnel in the event of an ammonia release. Administrative controls limit the utilization of vessels to less than their intended maximum capacities.\n\nThe company has also developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for notifying public and local emergency responders, emergency evacuation of personnel, first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel, use of emergency alarms and equipment, employee training in evacuation and response procedures; and periodic review and updating of the written plan.\n",

      "SummaryText": "PROCESS SUMMARY\n\nThe Reddy Ice facility located in East Point, Georgia, manufactures ice for wholesale/retail distribution. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice making and cold storage. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration operation consists of two standard design ammonia loops for the icemaking side and the refrigeration side, consisting of common compressors, condensers, and main liquid ammonia storage tank, with secondary storage vessels and ice makers or freezer vault evaporators specific to the systems. Each system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high temperature and pressure, low suction pressure, low oil pressure differential on all compressors, high and low liquid level cutouts, and pressure safety relief valves on all applicable equipment. Ammonia detectors and alarms are installed throughout the plant. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facilityA?s program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\n\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include continuous and emergency engine room ventilation, pressure safety relief valves that discharge to a water-filled neutralization tank, failsafe controls that shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and computerized PLC controls allowing the entire system to be shut down remotely if required.

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice corporate management and Reddy Ice-East Point management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment.

Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals. The plant engineer is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. A rotating safety committee is selected each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-East Point facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. Worst-case and alternative release scenarios from facility, company, and industry history were studied and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Reddy Ice-East Point facility has had one release since 2005 that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history. In July 2010, an 1,800-pound release resulted from mechanical damage to a refrigeration unit inside an ice storage vault. One street was barricaded near the plant and five employees were evacuated from a neighboring facility, but there were no other offsite consequences. One Reddy employee was treated onsite for ammonia exposure and released. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nThe Reddy Ice-East Point facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and period"

The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\n\nThe Reddy Ice-East Point facility has recently been redesigned and reengineered for improved efficiency and safety. No additional changes are currently planned. Reddy Ice-East Point operates an ongoing program of facility preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations. On a corporate level, Reddy Ice continues to implement changes to improve safety and decrease environmental impacts at all plants.\n\n"
