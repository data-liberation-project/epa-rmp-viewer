      "SummaryText": "1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), Section 112(r) Risk Management Program rules, outlined in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) requires covered facilities that handle, manufacture, use, or store any of the toxic and flammable substances listed in 40 CFR 68.130 above the specified threshold quantities (TQs) in a process to develop and implement a Risk Management Program as issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.EPA).  The goal of Part 68 is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. In general, Part 68 requires that:\n\n?    Facilities must develop and implement a Risk Management Program and maintain documentation of the program at the site.  The Risk Management Program must include an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\n?    Facilities must also develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP), which includes registration information, to U.S.EPA no later than June 21, 1999, or the date on which the Facility first has more than a TQ in a process, whichever is later.  The RMP provides a summary of the Risk Management Program.  The RMP will be available to federal, state, and local government agencies.\n\n\n\nCovered facilities also must continue to implement the Risk Management Program and update their RMPs periodically or when processes change, as required by the Rule.\n\n\n\nThe Dynegy Kendall Energy, LLC Facility (Facility), located at 1401 County Line Road in Minooka, Illinois (the Facility),[1] is a 1,100 megawatt combined-cycle power generation plant that includes four (4) gas turbines, four (4) heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), four (4) reheat condensing steam turbines, and one wet-induced-draft cooling tower."

One process water storage pond at the Facility is used to store raw water for use as emergency backup water for Facility cooling, treatment, and maintenance operations.  Additional supporting structures at the Facility include various water tanks, electrical transformers, chemical tanks, and curbed and covered areas for boiler chemical feed systems.  Natural gas is the primary fuel to be used in the power generation process. \n\n\n\nTo protect the environment, aqueous ammonia is used at the Facility to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) pollutants which are generated from the combustion of natural gas.  Specifically, ammonia is the reducing agent used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) NOx control systems.  The SCR is a post-combustion gas treatment technique that reduces nitrous oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the turbine exhaust stream to molecular nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O).\n\n\n\nThe Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for site personnel, the community, contractors, and the environment.  To meet this commitment, systems have been established to help ensure safe operation of the processes of this Facility.  One component of these systems is the Risk Management Program that has been established and implemented to assist in managing the risks involved with the storage and use of aqueous ammonia, the only hazardous substances stored and used at the Facility that is regulated pursuant to 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response - 40 CFR 68.155(a), 40 CFR 68.155(c) and 40 CFR 68.155(e)\n\n\n\nAt the Facility, comprehensive accidental release prevention and emergency response programs have been established.

Based upon this examination, the Facility had (1) one accidental release from the covered process referenced above (a process that has a regulated substance present exceeding the TQ) that resulted in off-site exposure.  The release occurred between June 20 and June 24, 2014, when approximately 2,484 gallons of 30% aqueous ammonia were released from a broken transfer pipeline 1.0 inches in diameter beneath the Unit 3 turbine building.  Evidence of a pipeline break first became apparent on June 24, at which time station personnel took action to isolate the line and stop the flow of ammonia through the line.  The broken pipe was purged, abandoned, and replaced with a new above ground piping on June 26, 2014.  The accident was investigated and response measures were completed by October 31, 2014.\n\n\n\n1.5       Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been established and implemented at the Facility.
