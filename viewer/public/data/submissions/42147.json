The management and employees of the Miamiville facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of acetylene.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, storage and distribution of acetylene.   Acetylene is manufactured by the addition of Calcium Carbide into water in a reactor vessel. A chemical reaction takes place and the acetylene is the compressed into cylinders containing an inert filler material and acetone. The acetylene dissolves into the acetone in the cylinder. Each cylinder is checked for weight of acetylene to insure that they have the proper amount of product. Cylinders are removed from the fill lines and placed into storage for shipment.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario and alternative release scenario reports can be reviewed at the location. They were conducted using the EPA Look up Tables and RMP*Comp (Ver.1.07). Results may be reviewed by contacting the facility.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems are in place throughout the process system. These would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, and Emergency Shut-off Valves, Flame Arrestors , vents, relief valves, grounding equipment, rupture disks, purge systems, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties.\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of acetylene.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation. "

They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process. \n \nWritten process safety information was developed for the acetylene system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of acetylene. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA was reviewed and updated in February, 2005 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed operating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed and approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were reviewed in May, 2004 and are annually reviewed and revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200).  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and non-routine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.

Training is provided to employees by traditional classroom and hands-on methods. The employees are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed on May, 2004.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractor?s safety procedures were last reviewed in October, 2004.  \n\nPre-Start-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used with new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last Pre-Start-up Safety Review was conducted in June, 2004.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations.

The hazards identified are communicated to those performing the work and to operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process.

This Program was reviewed in June, 2002 for both employees and contractors.\n \nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"Replacement in Kind\".
