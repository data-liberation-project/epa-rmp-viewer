It is our goal to achieve and sustain \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through effective communication, information, and training.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our procedure to notify the Pawtucket Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Pawtucket Power is a combined-cycle cogeneration power plant.  The regulated substances handled at the facility are anhydrous ammonia, used as a refrigerant to enhance gas turbine performance and efficiency, and aqueous ammonia, used as a catalyst to control nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.  The general accidental release prevention program at Pawtucket Power has been develped to comply with EPA's Accidental Prevention Rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule, and all other applicable state and local codes and regulations.  Each system and piece of equipment at Pawtucket Power is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the aforementioned codes, laws, and regulations.  Pawtucket Power.  Chemical specific prevention steps for aqueous ammonia involve the use of high level alarms on the storage tank to prevent overfilling and periodic equipment inspections.  The specific prevention steps relative to anhydrous ammonia involve complete system inspections upon each re-start by a qualified firm, ammonia monitoring and detection in the vent system and equipment building, and the use of a deluge system to mitigate releases. There have been no accidents associated with ammonia during the life of the facility, through June 2004.  The emergency response program at Pawtucket Power is to contact the Pawtucket Fire Department.  It is our policy to request the Fire Department's response to an emergency and inspect the facility annually to ensure that are familiar with the facility systems and materials.
