The reason for submitting this RMP is to comply with the mandatory five years update and to report the change of ownership from ConAgra Poultry Company to Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation.  This facility has one ammonia refrigeration systems with an inventory capacity above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia in this system has not changed since the last RMP plan submitted in January 1999, and no significant additional controls have been added to the process.\n\nManagement at Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Moorefield Processing Plant recognizes its responsibility in protecting employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel and the neighboring community are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the facility.\n\nPilgrim's Pride Corporation is committed to the safety of its employees, the communities surrounding its plants, and the environment.  This commitment includes both human health and environmental protection.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration process equipment.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions of the plant HAZMAT Team with the Moorefield Fire Department.  This is achieved by ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation and by getting the members of the Fire Department acquainted with the facility.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Hea"

These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for the Moorefield facility site, including consideration of ammonia release scenarios as \u00bfworst case release\u00bf and \u00bfalternative release scenario\u00bf. We do have several active mitigation systems to minimize any effect incidents like these would have.  We also incorporate several management systems to decrease the likelihood of this incident occurring.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\u00b7  Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners.\n.  Preventative maintenance programs.\n.  Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners.\n\u00b7  Performance of process hazard analyses of the entire system including equipment and piping.\n\u00b7  Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\u00b7  Procedure for handling all changes to the system.\n\u00b7  Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications.\n\u00b7  Up-to-date process safety information.\n\u00b7  Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses.\n\u00b7  Hot-work permits for work on or near the ammonia process.\n\u00b7  Line Break procedures.\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.

We also give our refrigeration partners HAZWOPER training on an annual basis.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, the Company performs periodical audits and hazard reviews to enhance continued safe performance.  Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked regularly for timely completion as required.\n\nThe emergency response program implemented at the facility contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.
