This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at Kraton that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nKraton Chemical is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Kraton has implemented reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards.\n\n\n\nThe BF3 System is housed in its' own secure unoccupied building.  It is remotely monitored by a CCTV system and actively monitored by both opacity monitors and BF3 chemical detectors.  In the event of a release the system automatically discharges a fog deluge system that will quench the BF3 release.  Any BF3 not quenched by the deluge system will be captured by a scrubber attached to the building.\n\n\n\nKraton Chemical provides response training to employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, Kraton Chemical established a management system headed by an Environmental, Health and Safety Manager (EHS Manager) to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\n\n1.2  Kraton Chemical and Boron Trifluoride\n\n\n\nKraton Chemical manufactures Terpene-Phenolic resins.

The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.  Approved recommendations are tracked to completion.  PHA revalidations are conducted in a similar fashion.  Key employees are contacted to review changes made in the covered process, previous recommendation status, process safety information, accuracy of piping and instrument diagrams, any qualifying incidents and any changes to facility siting or human factors checklists.\n\n\n\n1.3.3  Operating Procedures.  Kraton Chemical process engineers, operators, and supervision work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as a reference guide for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include: steps for safely conducting activities; applicable process safety information such as safe operating limits and consequences of deviation; and safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards and personal protective equipment requirements.\n\n\n\nKraton Chemical operating procedures cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a maintenance outage or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n\n\n1.3.4  Training.
