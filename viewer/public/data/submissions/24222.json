In this scenario 77,449 lbs. would be released by a catastrophic vessel failure resulting in an explosion calculated to cause a 1-psi pressure increase at an endpoint distance of 0.349 miles. The offsite impact of this scenario involves zero (0) public receptors and zero (0) environmental receptors, this receptor identification was verified using a resent area photo and site visits and the EPS's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidance reference tables and equations were used to model this scenario. The ARCHIE software utilized by Williams in this modeling is recognized to be sufficient by the EPA. The normal operating level of the Product Surge Tank is 27% of the full liquid height, the high level alarm is set at 67% of the full liquid height and the high level shutdown as discussed above. The Product Surge Tank is also covered by Pressure Safety Valve (PSV-125) which is Fire Sized and set at 450 PSIG. Clearly this hypothetical situation would never happen.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe Markham Gas Processing Plant is a facility that is covered by Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (OSHA 1910). The essential provision of PSM is Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - a careful review of what could go wrong and what safeguards must be implemented to prevent releases of hazardous chemicals. Through a series of PHAs, the entire process at the Markham Plant has been reviewed, and the plant is in the process of revalidating the existing PHAs.\nThe PSM program of the plant requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire process. The approach addresses the process design, process technology, process changes operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans"

To assist the location in the implementation of the PSM program, the plant has assigned a person to the sole responsibility of PSM coordinator, and this person is responsible directly to management.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe Markham Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect the personnel and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire and/or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Employees receive monthly training in these procedures to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated annually due to possible modifications made to the gas plant. These changes are administered through Management of Change (MOC) process and our Tulsa office. The overall emergency response program for the Markham Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination included attending periodic meetings of the committee that included local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The facility has 24-hour communications capability with Matagorda County's LEPC, along with offering the local fire department and other emergency response organizations the opportunity to participate in periodic MOCK emergency drills. Markham Gas Processing Plant EOP manual is also updated annually and delivered to our emergency response officials and various industry representatives.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe have not had a single release of a regulated substance at the Markham Gas Proc"

This initial training includes principals of incident command and emergency response, as well as fire fighting techniques."

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe employees at the Markham Gas Processing Plant are strongly committed to EMPLOYEE, PUBLIC and ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY. The commitment is demonstrated by conforming to our Process Safety Management Program and various resources invested in accident prevention. MOCK emergency drills are conducted monthly and specific training of our personnel is required in order to eliminate the occurrence of possible hazards. These goals are achieved with every project design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement the appropriate controls to prevent any possible release of our regulated substances to the surrounding public domains, existing waterways and/or animal habitats. The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) utilized at the Markham Gas Processing Plant includes designated procedures mandated by the Williams management group. These specific procedures are for notification of agencies, evacuation of public receptors and response of trained personnel to control and contain the release.\n\nTHE STATIONY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Markham Gas Processing Plant is located in a rural area of Matagorda County, Texas I&GN AA Co. Survey A-329. The physical located is 1 1/2 miles northeast of Markham, Texas on Farm Maintenance Road FM2175.
