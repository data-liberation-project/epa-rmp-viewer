This regulation requires many of the same regulations as the RMP requirements for Program 3 such as; Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity and others.  The PSM rule also includes Employee Participation, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews and Trade Secrets. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nWestover Dairy has a written emergency response plan that is filed with the Lynchburg City LEPC.  The Westover Dairy emergency response team receives training on fire fighting, hazardous materials, and emergency medicine.  The emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  Westover Dairy closely communicates with local and county response teams. \r\n\r\nReview of Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has only been one accident in the last five years.  It occured on 07/22/2015.  A contractor cut an ammonia line at 2:52 pm.  Approximately 352 lbs of ammonia was released over a 3 hour period.  A total of 80 people from the plant and a nearby school were evacuated.  The Lynchburg HAZMAT team was contacted and they responded to the incident.  The NSR, SERC and EPA were also contacted.  The were no deaths or injuries resulting from the release.  There was a nominal amount of on-site property damage and no off-site property damage.  The cause of the accident was determined to be human error.  Corrective measures included reviewing the incident with the contractor, requiring the contractor to have a lead employee on site when cutting and painting lines that are to be cut.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nBased on this review of the ammonia refrigeration system there are no planned changes to improve safety at this time, however Westover Dairy is dedicated to continuously strive to achieve safety levels that equal or surpass the best in th"

Westover Dairy also complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Lynchburg City Fire Department and request that they respond.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWestover Dairy receives, stores, and processes milk products.  Many of the products must be stored at temperatures near or below freezing and, therefore, ammonia refrigeration systems are needed to cool and/or freeze different areas throughout the process. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nWestover Dairy complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  First, and most important, this facility is designed to promote prevention, both in the building itself and the equipment used as part of the refrigeration process.  Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Audits are regularly conducted to determine if all safety provisions are being properly implemented.  We have a preventive maintenance program and maintenance schedule which includes regular maintenance of compressors, pumps, evaporators, condensers, control valves, ammonia detectors, scrubbers, and emergency response equipment.   Westover Dairy promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of ammonia with prevention as our goal.  Westover Dairy employees are encouraged to voice their views on accident prevention issues and to recommend possible changes be"
