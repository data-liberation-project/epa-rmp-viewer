      "SummaryText": "The Butterball Jonesboro, AR facility produces deli meat products for deli and foodservice distribution.Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve poultry products.  Butterball has one regulated substance under 40 DFR 68: anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant of the products in various areas of the facility.  Butterball has developed an OSHA (PSM) program for its ammonia refrigeration system.  At this facility, ammonia is catorgorized within RMP as a Program Level 3.  EPA has stated that if the process is in compliance with their OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus Butterball's ammonia PSM system has been reviewed and the PSM elements are in compliance and being implemented for RMP.  This Butterball facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  It is a detailed document that discusses the role of employees in an emergency.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacutation of plant personnel.  All emergency response (HAZMAT TEAM) personnel undergo  emergency training.  Based upon a comleted Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items to improve safety was developed and their status monitored to ensure implementation is being accomplished."
