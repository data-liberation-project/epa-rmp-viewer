This facility will rely upon the local emergency hazardous materials response team and the local Fire Department for responses to uncontrolled releases of sulfur dioxide.  In accordance with 19 CCR \u00a72765.1, the facility is not required to have an Emergency Response Plan in place.  However, it is required to have appropriate mechanisms in place for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response.  These mechanisms are described below. \r\n \r\nThe Facility submitted a Hazardous Material Inventory (HMI) Business Plan via California Environmental Reporting System (CERS) in November 27, 2019.  The Facility has procedures in place to evacuate the facility and notify responders when there is a need for a response.  A current copy of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) can be found with the Safety Manager.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  These studies include the following: Hazard Review and Hazard Assessment, performed on July 8, 2020.

Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\r\nThe facility is limited to a maximum intended inventory of sulfur dioxide of nine (9) one-ton cylinders (2,000 lbs. each) are kept on-site for a total of 18,000 lbs.
