LES is a municipally-owned and operated electric utility with sole service responsibility in and around Lincoln, Nebraska.  As a publicly owned utility, LES operates and maintains all of the equipment in our system in a manner representing prudent utility practices and in conformance with the expectations of LES customer/owner\u00bfs.  LES strives for excellence in the facility operations and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of LES policies and by developing and maintaining this Risk Management Program LES is complying with the Federal Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and the Risk Management Program defined in it.  LES is committed to the accidental release prevention program.  \n\nLES maintains a thorough detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for an ammonia release for the Salt Valley Generating Station.  The plan will be reviewed with response organizations and others.  \n\n50 CFR 68.155(b)The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe LES Salt Valley Generating Station, owned and operated by LES, provides emergency, peaking and base load electric power generation. There are three LM 6000 dual fuel aeroderivative combustion turbines located on the 320-acre site; one of which operates in simple cycle, and two operate in either simple cycle or combined cycle.  The LM 6000 turbines are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for NOx emission control.  This system uses anhydrous ammonia which is fed into the exhaust combustion gases upstream of the SCR catalyst modules.\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in a pressure vessel under ambient temperature.

As the result, the normal operating amount of ammonia stored in the Salt Valley Generating Station is 10,200 gallons or 51,000 pounds.  \n\n40 CFR 68.155(c)The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\n\nUnder the Risk Management Program, an offisite consequence analysis is required for an accidental release of a regulated substance.  In Salt Valley Generating Station\u00bfs case, anhydrous ammonia is the regulated substance.  Modeling of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia are required for offsite consequence analysis under Program 2.\n\nEPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The largest quantity is determined by taking into account administrative controls that limit the quantity of a substance that can be stored or processed in a vessel at any one time, or alternatively, procedures that occasionally allow the vessel to store greater than usual quantities.   EPA defined alternative release scenarios to be any release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite.\n\nFor offsite consequence analysis, the movement and dispersion of a regulated aubstance release to the atmosphere is predicted using the computer model called Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmosphere (ALOHA).  ALOHA predicts pollutant concentration downwind from the source, taking into consideration the physical characteristics of ammonia, the physical characteristics of the site, weather condition, and the circumstance of the release.\n\nThe worst case scenario selected for the Salt Valley Generating Station is the loss of 51,000 pounds of pressurized a"

The maintenance program includes pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems and ancillary equipment, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance procedures are developed or promulgated by equipment vendors, federal or state regulations, or industry codes.\n\n\u00bfIncident Investigation\nThe current Lincoln Electric System Emergency Ammonia Release Response Plan for Salt Valley Generating Station is a component of the Incident Investigation process.  Incident reporting procedures are well defined.  Responsibilities, titles and phone numbers are given in a highly readable document.\n\n40 CFR 668.155(e)The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history involves an examination of the effects of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the five years prior to the submission of a Risk Management Program.  The five-year accident history covers:\n\n\u00bfA release of anhydrous ammonia from Salt Valley Generating Station that caused at least one of the following:\n1.Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (40 CFR part 68.42(a)); or\n2.Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (40 CFR part 68.42(a)).\n\nThe Salt Valley Generating Station is a newly constructed facility, there have been no releases that conform with accidental release requirements that caused death, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage either on or off site.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(f)The Emergency Response Program\n\nLES has a thorough detailed Emergency Ammonia Release Response Plan designated specifically for an ammonia release for Salt Valley Generating Station.
