This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \n\n\n\nThe Hawkins Gas Plant, located about 1.5 miles northeast of Hawkins, TX, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes several operations (e.g., compression, dehydration, separation, cryogenic) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  \n\n\n\nThis plant could contain regulated flammables but no regulated toxic inventories in excess of threshold quantities established in the regulation.  Transportation into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines and trucks.  The adjacent oil treating station for the field operations handles produced water and condensate (i.e., no regulated flammables) and is not considered part of the covered process.  This plant is located in a rural setting surrounded by pasture and woodlands.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results \n\n\n\nIn accordance with special security guidance provided by the USEPA, data addressing the facility's Offsite Consequence Analyses (Worst Case Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios) are not detailed in this section.

These prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Features\n\n\n\nThis plant has safety features on many units to: quickly detect a release, contain/control a release, and reduce/mitigate the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection \n\n- Hydrocarbon gas detectors and alarms near hydrocarbon storage tanks\n\n- Oxygen detectors for accute nitrogen releases creating an oxygen deficient atmosphere\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control \n\n- Pressure/thermal relief valves/rupture disks\n\n- Manual/automatic isolation valves\n\n- Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameter \n\n- Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n\n- Firewall around product storage area\n\n- Coffer dams on nearby creeks\n\n- Storm drain system skimmers\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation  \n\n- Personal protective equipment\n\n- Spill containment material\n\n- Trained personnel\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis plant has had an excellent record for accident prevention over the past 5 years.  In fact, there have not been any incidents, as defined in the regulation.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThis plant maintains a written action program to protect the workers, public, and environment.  The program consists of procedures for handling releases of regulated substances (i.e., flammables) including the possibility of fires or explosions.  The procedures address: facility/equipment isolation and shutdown, initial first aid and medical treatment for exposures (i.e., Material Safety Data Sheet information), evacuation plans for this plant, accounting for plant personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and post-incident cleanup/decontamination requirements.  In addition, this facility has procedures that address th"

Facility personnel receive training on these procedures, as necessary, to perform their specific duties.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency action program is reviewed annually and updated when necessary.  Plan changes required because of modifications to this facility or emergency response equipment are administered through the management of change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency program for this plant is coordinated with the Hawkins Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Hawkins Volunteer Fire Department, Wood County Sheriff's Department, and local ambulance services.  This plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the emergency response organizations.  These organizations are responsible (if necessary) for notifying the public, coordinating the community response (e.g., blocking off roads, evacuation, etc.), and providing onsite response (e.g., fire fighting, medical treatment, etc.).  This plant conducts periodic emergency action drills and provides periodic refreshers to the local emergency response organizations on the hazards associated with the plant operations.\n\n\n\nRecent Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nOur Operations Integrity Management Systems form the cornerstone for continuous improvement in our safety-related systems.  These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through many small improvement steps.  These improvement steps are tightly integrated with our training programs.  This plant resolves findings from PHAs, incident investigations, and safety audits.  \n\n\n\nExamples of changes that were recently implemented to improve the safety of this operation are: \n\n\n\n- Enhancement and expansion of training program associated with new facilities"
