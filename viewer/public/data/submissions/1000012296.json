Propane is used in the pasturizing of the products. It is received from retailers by truck and stored in an 18,000 gallon tank. The maximum inventory of the tank is controlled at 85 percent level.\r\n\r\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this plant is 65,178 pounds.\r\n \r\nSUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCE OF FAILURE TO CONTROL HAZARDS\r\n\r\nAMMONIA\r\n\r\nHealth Hazards\r\n\r\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with extremely pungent odor. Liquid ammonia vaporizes to a poisonous gas cloud.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is a severe irritant of the eyes. It penetrates the eyes more readily than any other alkali. Contact with liquid anhydrous ammonia and concentrated solutions can produce severe eye injury or blindness. Exposure of the eyes to high gas concentrations can cause temporary blindness and severe eye damage. Laceration or watering of the eyes can occur upon exposure to 150 ppm gas and higher.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is an irritant by inhalation. At increasing concentrations it can cause symptoms ranging from runny nose, coughing, chest pain, trouble with breathing, and death. It can cause severe breathing difficulties that are delayed in onset. Inhalation of concentrations of 2500 to 6500 ppm causes shortness of breath, bronchospasm, chest pain, and pulmonary edema (filling of the lungs with fluid) that may be fatal.\r\n\r\nExposure of the skin to liquid anhydrous ammonia or high concentrations of the gas can cause first and second degree burns to the skin. Vapor concentrations of 10,000 ppm are mildly irritating to moist skin, while 30,000 ppm or greater causes a stinging sensation and can produce skin burns and blisters. These high concentrations of ammonia are corrosive to moist skin and other body tissues.\r\n\r\nAmmonia or ammonia with oil or other debris is an e"

      "SummaryText": "xplosion hazard when exposed to flame or fire. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) is 16% and Upper Explosive Limit (UEL) is 25% by volume in air. Elevated temperatures can cause containers of the substance to explode. Ammonia emits toxic fumes when exposed to heat. When heated to temperatures above 850A\u00b0F, ammonia will emit hydrogen gas. The auto ignition temperature is 1204A\u00b0F if catalyzed by iron.\r\n\r\nAmmonia can react to form potential explosive reactions with halogens (e.g., chlorine, bromine). It can react to form potential violent or explosive reactions with strong oxidizers, hypo chlorite bleaches, silver compounds, mercury compounds, gold, other metals and acids.\r\n\r\nCommon Exposure and Control Methods\r\nA\u00b7\tProcess enclosure\r\nA\u00b7\tLocal exhaust ventilation\r\nA\u00b7\tGeneral dilution ventilation\r\nA\u00b7\tPersonal protective equipment\r\nA\u00b7\tUse of water\r\nA\u00b7\tArea monitoring (with alarm systems)\r\n\r\nPotential for Exposure to Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration operation is a closed system with no purposeful exposure to ammonia. As a closed system, exposure potentials are primarily related to equipment failure, fugitive emissions from improperly adjusted or worn valve packings, pump and compressor seals and pipe connector gaskets, or mistakes in operation of the system.\r\n\r\nPROPANE\r\n\r\nHealth Hazards\r\n\r\nPropane is a colorless gas with faint petroleum-like odor. It is shipped as liquefied gas under its vapor pressure. For transportation it may be stenched. Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite. It is easily ignited. Its vapors are heavier than air and a flame can flash back to the source of leak very easily. This leak can be either a liquid or vapor leak. It can asphyxiate by the displacement of air. Under fire conditions the cylinders or tank cars may violently rupture and rocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIVE YEAR HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere has been only one incident during the last five years at the Simeus Foods International(Valley Fine Foods) plant site involving ammonia.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nIn this facility, we use Anhydrous Ammonia and propane, which are considered hazardous by the EPA. These chemicals must be used to provide cooling for the process and controlling the process heating. It is our policy to have programs in place dealing with safety precautions in handling these substances in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia and propane combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \r\n\r\nThis facilities emergency response program is based on the IIAR's Risk Management Guidelines Program for Ammonia Refrigeration and NPGA's LP Gas Handbook Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Response Procedures. The plan has been provided and reviewed with the Rutherford County Local Emergency Planner Center. Coordination with the LEPC has been made to notify them through the emergency response plan to respond to incidents that may affect the public.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Valley Fine Foodsmanufacturing facilities is in the business of processing ravioli and lasagna. These products require cooking controls and cooling of the materials during and after being processed. There is one hazardous chemical (Anhydrous Ammonia) and one flammable (propane) used at this site for these purposes.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the refrigerant used for the cooling process due to the low cost of the medium and the low temperatures that must be obtained. The ammonia is enclosed within a closed loop that removes heat from the products and storage rooms. The ammonia is evaporated by removing heat from the products and cooling areas"
