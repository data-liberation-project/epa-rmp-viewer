Anhydrous ammonia is a \r\ngas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system \r\nis used to control the processing and storage temperature for ice cream \r\nand related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately \r\n23,100 pounds (i.e., 4,300 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states \r\n(gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the control \r\npressure receiver that operates at approximately 100 pounds per square \r\ninch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 8,700 pounds of liquid \r\nammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90 percent).  However, \r\nduring typical operation, the vessel holds only about 4,900 pounds.  Most \r\nof the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, \r\nmake-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \r\nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \r\nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \r\npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \r\nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \r\npiping, and equipment.\r\n\r\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nIce Cream Specialties, Inc. operates two separate ammonia systems, \r\nreferred to as the North and South systems.  The North ammonia \r\nrefrigeration system is a two-stage system.  The high-pressure receiver \r\nsupplies high-pressure (130 to 17"

Liquid \r\nammonia from the low-pressure receiver is recirculated to the freezer \r\nunits.  Ammonia vapor from the low-pressure receiver feeds three booster \r\ncompressors, which compress the vapor and discharge into the \r\nintercooler.  Vapor from the intercooler is supplied to three high-stage \r\ncompressors.  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \r\ngas) is vented to two evaporative condensers.  The condensed liquid is \r\nreturned to the high-pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe South ammonia refrigeration system is also a two-stage system.  Two \r\nhigh-pressure receivers supply high-pressure liquid ammonia to the \r\ncontrol pressure receiver.  The control pressure receiver regulates system \r\npressure and supplies high-pressure liquid ammonia at 100 psig to several \r\nprocess units including: storage tanks #1-14, glycol chiller, freezers #1-5, \r\nprocess room air units, HVAC coil, and plate chiller.\r\n\r\nLiquid/vapor ammonia from the above referenced South system units is \r\nreturned to one of four low-pressure receivers where the liquid and vapor \r\nseparate.  In addition, the low-pressure receivers supply liquid ammonia \r\nto the blast cell air units (30 psig) and Gram freezers #1 and 2 (50 psig). \r\nLiquid ammonia from the low-pressure receivers is recirculated to the \r\nprocess units.  Ammonia vapor from the low-pressure receivers feeds six \r\nbooster compressors, which compress the vapor and discharge into the \r\nintercooler.  Vapor from the intercooler is supplied to nine high-stage \r\ncompressors.  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \r\ngas), at 130 to 170 psig, is vented to three evaporative condensers.

Safety interlocks include high-\r\npressure and high-temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as \r\nwell as high level floats and sensors for vessels.  The high-pressure \r\ncutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\r\n\r\nA release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\r\n\r\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\r\n\r\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\r\n\r\n* Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\r\n\r\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system;\r\n\r\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and\r\n\r\n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing valves in the liquid lines.\r\n\r\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release scenarios required by 40 CFR 68.
