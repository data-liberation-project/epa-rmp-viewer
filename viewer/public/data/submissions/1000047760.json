Nitrogen is produced by cryogenic separation of air.  Hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas, and is also delivered by truck from remote locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in the part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA:  Liquid hydrogen, which is vaporized (converted) to a gas and supplied via pipeline to an on-site customer for the use in silane and polysilicon manufacturing processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that assure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Silverbow, MT facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physi"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n\n\nAt the Silverbow facility, we have installed additional process isolation valves to enhance our capability to shut down the process safely in the event of an incident. We have also upgraded our fire detection system to increase our ability to detect and respond to minor problems before they can become major incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nOn August 9, 2014 at approximately 2110 MDT, a fire was discovered on the bottom of the liquid hydrogen Tank #1.  The fire was extinguished at 2135 MDT by the Emergency responders and the source was isolating, thereby limiting the release of hydrogen to 25 minutes.  There were no injuries, no shelter in place or off-site consequence.  Aproximately 1060"

The main cause was an incorrectly installed 1/4\" compression fitting connected to the liquid hydrogen pressure building regulator that leaked liquid hydrogen which eventually ingnited and started a fire.  Corrective actions include updating maintenance procedure to ensure compression fitting are torqued to the correct valve, and to replace gaskets with more suitable materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.  \n\n\n\nFor any incidents, Praxair has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with REC Silicon and local responders as deemed appropriate by REC. Praxair has a LEAP (Local Emergency Assistance Program), with responders located throughout the United States, closest being in Butte, MT\n\n  \n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least\n\nannually.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPraxair has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \"Zero/Zero\", which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\n\n\nAddition of fire water monitors to the site and addition of a series of fire detection monitors to the LH2 Storage Tank area."
