Washington Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) #58 (2004 Edition) for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage, and it is this facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Washington Fire Department as well as the Wilkes County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Wilkes County Emergency Medical Service and Wills Memorial Hospital.  This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Texon, L.P. - Washington Terminal is a butane transfer facility (specifically, rail car to truck tanker).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane transfer systems only, including the associated piping and one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank (railcar).\n\nThis facility's worst case sceniario is the failure if the transfer system's one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1PSI overpressure) extends off-site to 0.4 miles and includes public receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely) scenario is a \"pull away\" accident resulting in a one minute pipe/hose release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends to 0.01 miles but does not effect public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe Texon, L.P. Washington Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
