The AGNE facility is a grocery warehouse facility and employs approximately 367 full-time employees.  The facility is equipped with an ammonia refrigeration system subject to the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions detailed in 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAGNE is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to AGNE's comprehensive accidental release prevention program associated with the regulated process.  The accidental release prevention program includes areas such as design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training of the closed-loop refrigeration system. It is the policy of AGNE to implement and maintain appropriate controls to prevent the accidental release of regulated substances. Additionally, AGNE has coordinated with the Pembroke City Fire Department and the Central NH Regional Emergency Planning Committee (REPC) for emergency response support in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nPresently, anhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity. Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in the closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for AGNE operations. Due to the size and characteristics of the ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the applicability of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, AGNE is covered under Program Level 3 of the RMP regulations.  The facility uses 22,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration purposes.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \n\n\n\nThe"

      "SummaryText": " Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Section 2 and 3 of the RMPeSubmit text.\n\n\n\nExhibit E-2 from EPA's Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia was used to evaluate the distance to the toxic end point for both the worst case and alternative release scenarios.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were evaluated and documented in the RMP Plan. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is based on a release of 14,000 pounds over a period of ten minutes from the intercooler/recirculator (V-2) which is the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia.  Based on Exhibit E-2 of the RMP Guidance, the distance to toxic endpoint is 2.2 miles, based on rural topography.  The area associated with the toxic endpoint includes a residential population of 4,390.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve. The release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (60.0 lbs/min) having a release-duration of ten minutes.  Based on RMP Guidance Exhibit 3, a release of 600 pounds under the alternative release scenario has a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles. No residences were identified within the area associated with the toxic endpoint, however several business and a church are within 0.2 miles of the site.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAGNE has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. To meet these necessary requirements AGNE has implemented a Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\nACCIDENT HI"

      "SummaryText": "STORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia related incidents at the AGNE facility within the last five years that have resulted in on, or off site property damage, injuries or deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility is equipped with ammonia leak detection with audible alarms and emergency ventilation. The automated emergency ventilation discharges the engine room air through the roof, reducing the concentration in the engine room.  Facility personnel will assess the release, consult the comprehensive emergency response plan, if necessary, and determine whether response assistance is necessary.\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response plan has been submitted to the local fire department and the REPC.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAGNE currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time. However, the process hazard analysis is periodically reviewed to evaluate and address newly identified potential hazards. AGNE personnel also periodically reviews the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n"
