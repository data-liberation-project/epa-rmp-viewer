The majority of the ammonia produced at the Yazoo City facility is used to make nitrogen fertilizers. It is these nitrogen fertilizers that feed the plants that in turn feed and clothe the world's population.\n\nAmong the many other things that Terra brings to its community is a commitment to operate safely. The company recognizes the health concerns of its neighboring community and is committed to responding to those concerns. A safe workplace is a top priority for company management and personnel. Terra employees continuously look for ways to operate and maintain the production facilities in a safe manner. Terra participates in routine safety training programs and drills. In addition, continuous monitoring and assessment of the plant facilities ensure that all operations are running smoothly and efficiently.\n\nTerra has a close working relationship with local emergency responders, and together we are prepared to respond to chemical emergencies within the facility. To ensure proper emergency preparedness, Terra has several teams of employees trained in confined space rescue, hazardous waste operations and other specialties. \n\nTerra's safety and environmental record reflects the company's commitment. We have multiple layers of safety and environmental protection integrated into our daily operations at our plants to protect our employees and the community. The following identifies some primary layers of protection:\n\n   * Managing risk is something we do on a daily basis.\n\n   * We have worked for many years to reduce risks at our site and to be prepared for emergencies.\n\n   * Our employees are highly skilled and well-trained.\n\n   * Our equipment is rountinely inspected and tested to make sure that it is safe.\n\n   * We have computer monitors and process controls throughout our plants to detect potential"

They involve what if scenarios where employee teams investigate\n     every known possible scenario of a new project and resolve it as part of the design phase of the project.\n\n   * Hazard reviews are also conducted on all existing Terra facilities.\n\n   * Emergency response, including employee responders as well as off-site responders, add another layer of protestion to the\n     community.\n\n   * We work closely with the civil defense, police and fire departments, and conduct routine drills.\n\n   * In the event of an emergency, we are prepared to respond within the facility.\n\nTerra has taken all the necessary steps to comply with all the accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in EPA's 40 CFR; Part 68. The following summarizes the elements of the release prevention program that are in operation at our Yazoo City facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWorkplace health and safety are of paramount concern. Terra maintains required files and makes its employees aware of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. This information is maintained in the workplace.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nTerra conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is known as the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, Terra maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal oper"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nTerra has a comprehensive training program to inform and educate employees to ensure they are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTerra carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment during each operational maintenance turnaround to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, turbines, compressors, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with training in maintenance practices. Futhermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nProposed changes are evaluated for potential impact in the areas of safety, regulatory, etc., before being implemented. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Review\nPre-startup safety reviews of new processes and to significant modifications in existing processes are conducted as a regular practice at Terra. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTerra conducts audits on a regular basis to monitor and sustain this process and ensure that Terra management is kept informed of all safety,"

These investigations are undertaken to indentify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nTerra believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the EPA Risk Mangement Program rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permits\nTerra recognizes the inherent danger associated with hot work and requires the issuance of a work permit for all such activities at the facility. The permit documents that all appropriate fire prevention requirements have been considered and implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations. The permit is kept at the site of the work until completion of the hot work operation.\n\nContractors\nTerra hires outside contractors to conduct some specialized maintenance and construction projects. All contractors working in the facility or visitors to the facility are expected to be aware of and adhere to all Terra health, safety, and environmental policies and procedures.

Terra's releases in the last five years have been typically very small releases to the air and do not meet the criteria stipulated in the regulations.\n\nTerra has an extensive emergency response program. Specific to the facility, there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all federal, state, and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, personal injury or fatality, and equipment failures.\n\nThe plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Futhermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nTerra strives on a daily basis to make its facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  Every employee and contractor will attend numerous safety and/or environmental training meetings annually. Terra and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety, and the environment. Our success is accomplished by research, innovation and the use of good common sense."
