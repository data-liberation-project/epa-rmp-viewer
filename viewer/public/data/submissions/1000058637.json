As part of this commitment, the Androscoggin Mill has established a system to ensure safe operation of the processes at the facility.   One component of this system is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that aids in the management of hazardous chemical safety in the mill; in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR Part 68.  One of the requirement of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan), describing the risk management program at the mill. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the rule as it applies to the mill.\n\n\n\nThe RMPlan was originally submitted on June 21, 1999 and this information was shared with the public at a meeting with the town of Jay on January 13, 2000.  \n\n\n\nThe risk management program at the mill consists of three elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases; and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of RMP regulated substances (chlorine dioxide and ammonia).\n\n\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered process).\n\n\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from the covered process.\n\n\n\nVerso limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the mill, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  Considerations are taken with also the existing chemicals on site.  For example, chlorine and methanol have been replaced with alternative, non-RMP covered chemicals.\n\n\n\nWhen a hazardous substance is used at the mill, the eq"

Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the process; including studying all safety aspects of the process through the Hazard and Operability studies (HazOps) and in the case of chlorine dioxide, following the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe mill is committed to the safety of the workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, the mill controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers as well as minimize impact to the public or the environment.  Verso provides training to all personnel, has a designated emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinated response efforts with the local fire department.  These response activities are documented and discussed with the LEPC.\n\n\n\nA single-vessel process (SVP) onsite generates an aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide for the bleaching process at the mill. The aqueous chloring dioxide has a maximum concentration of approximately 12.5 g/L (approximately 1.25%) and is pumped into two aboveground storage tanks each with a maximum capacity of 240,000-gallons (approximately 25,158 lbs.). In 1992, the mill began a formal prevention program for the chlorine dioxide generation and storage processes. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Verso prevention program that address the EPA and OSHA requirements.\n\n\n\nProgram Level 3 Prevention Program:  The program level 3 prevention plan applies to the chlorine dioxide generation and storage processes, consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n1. Process Safety Information\n\n2. Process Hazards Analysis\n\n3. Operation Procedures\n\n4"
