Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Fort Madison, IA - Canned Meat Foods facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration system.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we have trained staff in emergency response and are coordinated with the Fort Madison Fire Department and the Lee County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility processing plant used for food manufacturing and canning (meat products such as Vienna Sausage, Chili, Treat, & Meat Spreads).  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-looped ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nDue to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration onsite, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability (>10,000 lbs.), this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n \n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.
