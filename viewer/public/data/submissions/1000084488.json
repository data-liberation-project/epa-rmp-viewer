In complying with these standards, Whole Foods is managing the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of a hazardous chemical. In this way we promote overall plant, worker and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling or the on-site movement of such chemicals or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nOur Worst Case scenario models the failure of the high pressure receiver containing 6,784 lbs of ammonia resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel a distance before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would with"
