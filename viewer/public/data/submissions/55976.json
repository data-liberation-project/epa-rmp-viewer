The areas addressed in this Executive Summary are covered in greater detail in the remainder of the RMP.  Appendix A contains a copy of the electronically submitted site registration to EPA, and Appendix B contains a copy of the toxic endpoint maps and data.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nCatenary Coal Company (Catenary) has policies and procedures that have trained their employees in the safe handling, storage and use of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees are also trained in emergency response procedures to prevent and/or mitigate the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at this facility.\n\nThe equipment used in the transportation, storage and use of anhydrous ammonia conform to the appropriate federal and state regulations dealing with that material.  Equipment and maintenance records are kept in company files.  Catenary uses qualified third party contractor (Airgas) to transport anhydrous ammonia to this facility and provide maintenance of the ammonia process.  Company personnel and/or independent safety consultants provide additional training in safety and emergency procedures for Catenary.\n\nCatenary has coordinated its emergency response procedures with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handling\n\nThere is one stationary source covered by this RMP.  The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  The tank capacity is 12,437 gallons.  The tank is not filled to a volume greater than 85 percent of total capacity, or 10,571 gallons.\n\nWorse Case and Alternative Scenarios Including Administration Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit Discharge Distances\n\nCatenary has performed a hazard assessment of its opera"

      "SummaryText": "tions and established that the worst case scenario release of anhydrous ammonia would result from the catastrophic failure of both storage tanks filled to 85 percent of capacity.  For this worst case scenario discharge, no administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered to limit the anticipated toxic endpoint of the regulated material.  EPA\u00bfs RMP Comp program was used to establish toxic endpoint data in the worse case scenario.  The worse case release scenario has established the toxic endpoint will extend away from the source radially for 4.0 miles.\n\nCatenary has performed a hazard assessment of its operations and established that the alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia most likely to result in a toxic release would occur from the failure of a transfer hose during the transfer of the regulated material from a bulk tanker truck to a storage tank.  For the alternative release scenario, Catenary considered the effects of passive mitigation systems such as the excess flow valves and the active mitigation measures initiated by employees monitoring the material transfer that will limit the duration and amount of material release to volumes below the capacity of both the tanker and storage tank.  The toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.3 miles radially from the source, according to the RMP*Comp program.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe storage tank is equipped with passive mitigation devices.  Excess flow valves are designed to prevent the rapid loss of regulated material through piping.  The buildup of excess pressure is released through pop-off valves.\n\nTransfer operations between bulk trucks and storage tank are monitored by trained personnel.  Employees and contractors have been trained as to the properly handling and hazards of anhydrous ammonia.  Storage containers are properly labeled and hazard warnings are posted.  Employees working with anhydrous ammoni"
