We only order the rail cars, we never touch them, they are on our premises for about 4 days full.  When Mears gets done we release the car amd the railroad will pick it up at their convience.  We do not own the 10-34-0 until it is used so it is really there on consignment.\n\nOur employees are trained in ammonia, know what to do in case of an emergency but Mears usually shows up about 7:00 pm and is gone before 8:00 am the next morning.  Thus we have no employee exposure to any type of disaster as the plant is closed.\n\nOur county emergency coordinator (Sherri Blaha) is notified when the car comes into Minatare.  She notifies the Minatare Fire Chief, and the Scottsbluff Hazmat team which has an agreement on any hazardous material spill  or leak with Minatare Fire Dept and they are ready as soon as that car is spotted by Burlington Northern Railroad.   The City of Scottsbluff is 8 miles from the city of Minatare.\n\nThe Facility Policy\nMidwest PMS owners, managemet and employees are committed to the prevention of any accidential releases of ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with The Mears Co, Local Fire Dept and Haz Mat Team from Scottsbluff to minimumize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information.\nThe primary activity of Midwest PMS is to stand back and Let Mears do their job.\n\nThe maximum storage that Mears would have there is 150,000 pounds (1 rail car)\n\nThe worst Case Scenario would be the release of 150,000 pounds and the distance to the endpoint would be .41 mile\n\nThe alternative release scenario would be the breaking of a hose, the automatic shut off valve would engage as well as the operator shutting it off manually and the end point of disperion will be .41 miles\n\nPrevention Plan\nMidwest PMS has implemented the provcision of Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Ammonia K-61."
