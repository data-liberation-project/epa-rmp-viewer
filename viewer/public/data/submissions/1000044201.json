This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n \n\nThe Maysville Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.  The Maysville Gas Plant uses hazard and operability studies (HAZOP's) which are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures.\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings are based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Maysville Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits. Any audit findings are developed by the audit team and forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nProcesses at the Maysville Gas Plant involve hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Maysville Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help:\n\n     (1) contain/control a release\n\n     (2) quickly detect a release, and\n\n     (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\n\n\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n     1. Hydrocarbon and hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms.\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n     1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n     2. Automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process.\n\n     3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high  temperature).\n\n     4. Curbing and/or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\n     5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system.\n\n     6. Atmospheric relief devices.\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n     1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems.\n\n     2. Deluge system for specific equipment.\n\n     3. Personnel trained in emergency action.\n\n     4. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus).\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Maysville Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances that resulted in onsite or offsite effects during the prior five years at the Maysville Gas Plant.  We investigate all incidents to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  There have been zero (0) incidents that have occurred during the past 5 years which had onsite or offsite effects.  There have been zero (0) RMP events with onsite or offsite effects for the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY"

      "SummaryText": " RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Maysville Gas Plant maintains a written emergency action plan which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions, which address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training on these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties. The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to processes or other Maysville Gas Plant facilities. The emergency action plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Maysville Gas Plant has been coordinated with the Garvin, and McClain County, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Maysville Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, Police and Sheriff's office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Maysville Gas Plant conducts emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated subst"
