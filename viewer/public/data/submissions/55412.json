This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass potato cold storage.  We have one regulated substances present at our facility: anhydrous ammonia used for cold storage refrigeration.  \r\nThis is a Program Level 2 CalARP.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\r\n\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP *Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe worst case:\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for this site involves the total catastrophic release of the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia receiver tank due to vehicular collision.  This release is considered to be in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air, but no other mitigation measures in place.  Atmospheric conditions are: Air Temperature: 77 degrees F; Stability Class: F; and Wind Speed: 1.5 m/s.\r\n\r\nAlternative Scenario \r\n\r\nAn alternative scenario is a release of anhydrous ammonia gas due to a leak in the process piping.  Atmospheric conditions for this scenario are: Stability Class: D; Wind Speed: 3m/s; and Air Temperature of 77-degrees F.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASTM standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our cold storage facility.\r\n\r\nSafety Information:\r\n\r\nVignolo Farms, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Review:\r\n\r\nOur facility has conducted comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and ammonia refrigeration operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of every five years or whenever major changes in the process are proposed.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis will be addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Vignolo Farms, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\n\r\nVignolo Farms, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the refrigeration system process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Program:\r\n\r\nVignolo Farms, Inc. carries out routine maintenanc"
