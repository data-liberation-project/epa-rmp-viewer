      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nThe Poet Biorefining-Leipsic facility is located approximately one and\n a half mile northeast of Leipsic, Ohio.  Poet Biorefining-Leipsic?s\n main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.\n  Production at the facility was initiated in January 2008.  Poet\n Biorefining-Leipsic produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is mixed\n with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is cooked and\n liquefied.  The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is\n added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars.  Yeast is\n added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 10% alcohol and is distilled,\n then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous\n ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two\n 2,000,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas\n condensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per\n federal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is stored (primarily)\n in Tank No. 805, which has a capacity of 112,800 gallons\n (approximately 710,000 pounds), and potentially in Tank No. 802, which has a\n capacity of 250,000 gallons (approximately 1,574,000 pounds).  NGC is blended\n in-line with the ethanol and transferred to vehicles for transport\n off-site.  The denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank\n trucks and rail cars.\n\nChemicals Regulated Under EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Program\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which\n exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.\n  The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage\n tank and the associated blending/transfer equipment and piping.  The\n denaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration of 2% to 5%.  The\n greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping\n system is the quantity in the denaturant st"

In the event of an\n emergency, Poet Biorefining-Leipsic?s Emergency Coordinator will direct\n internal response activities to the extent they are within the\n qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable\n precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of\n materials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees\n within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such\n response does not pose a danger to their health or safety.  In the\n event of a larger release, it is the policy of Poet Biorefining-Leipsic to\n notify the Leipsic Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the\n facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program, and Chemical-Specific Prevention\n Steps\nPoet Biorefining-Leipsic is committed to protection of the environment\n through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training\n and response preparation.  Public access to the facility from the\n highway is restricted by a gate.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting\n vehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically\n on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a multi-camera video\n surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based\n alarm system.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage\n tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill\n monitors).  The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal\n conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible\n alarms.  All of the facility storage tanks have secondary storage\n containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and\n Count"
