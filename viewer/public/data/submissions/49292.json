Specifically, piperidine is used in the production of anti-HIV/AIDs pharmaceuticals.  Pharmaceuticals are primarily produced via synthesis routes involving organic chemicals.  \n\nPiperidine is an organic chemical used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals.  The piperidine threshold for triggering applicability of 40 CFR 68 is 15,000 pounds per process.  The main process vessel containing piperidine has a worst case capacity greater than 15,000 pounds.\n\nPiperidine is a chemical with a pungent odor that is readily detectable below concentrations of concern.  The odor is described in literature as amine-like, heavy, sweet, floral, animal odor, odor of pepper.  Due to the odor, exposed persons will not voluntarily stay in areas of even low concentrations.  Little data regarding exposure limits is available in the literature, however Roche Colorado Corporation has been advised by expert toxicologist's to consider the following concentrations for emergency response planning purposes:\n\t\n\t1 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration for up to one hour without experiencing other than mild, transient adverse health effects or without perceiving a clearly defined objectionable odor. \n\n\t10-100 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration range for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\n\t100-1000 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration range for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life threate"

Roche Colorado Corporation has evaluated the requirements of the RMP rule and has reviewed present emergency management practices.  Roche Colorado Corporation has determined that current practices meet or exceed the requirements of RMP.  This updated plan is being submitted because the process that uses titanium tetrachloride is discontinued.  Titanium Tetrachloride has not been stored on site for the past six months. \n\nRoche Colorado Corporation is a member of the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care\u00ae program certified to the RC14001/ISO 14001 standard. Responsible Care\u00ae consists of a comprehensive management system designed to address risks associated with the handling of chemicals including site security.  Moreover, Roche Colorado Corporation has an extensive process safety management program designed to satisfy all of Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management program requirements and the RMP.  Roche Colorado Corporation is dedicated to working with the community emergency response authorities to address the potential for releases that could affect the public.  Roche Colorado Corporation employs physical and administrative controls to mitigate potential releases.  Roche Colorado Corporation implements extensive internal training to prevent releases as well as prepare for eventualities which may result from releases.  Roche Colorado Corporation is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and endeavors to prepare the LEPC for the possibility of responding to releases that could originate from Roche Colorado Corporation. \n\n2.0 PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nRoche Colorado Corporation has one regulated substances u"
