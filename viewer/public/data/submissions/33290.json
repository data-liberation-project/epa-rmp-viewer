The facility is located at 625 E. US Highway 36. Equistar employs approximately 100 full time employees at the plant site.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary \nsource (? 68.155a):\n\nEquistar is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public \nand the environment.  As part of this commitment, Equistar has established a system to help \nensure safe operation of the processes at the Tuscola Plant. One component of this system is a \nrisk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with \nthe requirements of the Environmental Protection (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental \nRelease Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule); and the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) \nStandard (29 CFR 1910.119).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirements of \nthe RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the \nPlant.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Tuscola Plant helps provide assurance that the \nfacility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety \nprogram at the Plant. In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place, establishing \nmany levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous substance, as well as injuries and \ndamage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, industry \nstandards and best practices.

When a hazardous substance is used, the chemical must be \napproved by the Health, Safety, and Environmental Department by undergoing an environmental and safety \nanalysis on the chemical to consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect the plant \nworkers, the public and the environment.  Any adverse effects must be addressed before the \nchemical is approved. \n\nEquistar strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the \nfacility: Equistar is committed to the safety of workers, the public and the preservation of the \nenvironment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Equistar \nimplements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a \nhazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, built, operated and maintained \nto reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely \nadhered to in the design, construction, installation and operation of the equipment. Equistar uses \nFire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing \nprocesses.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.  In addition, Equistar requires \nthe documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of affected employees with \nregard to these procedures as part of the management of change process. Equistar's mechanical \nintegrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the \nequipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.  The Tuscola \nPlant also participates in auditing processes to measure and enhance its prevention program.\n\nEquistar's goal is to minimize impact"

Equistar provides response \ntraining to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response \nactivities, conducts regular drills to review response activities and coordinates response efforts \nwith area industry and the local emergency response agencies. Equistar trains its workers to \nrespond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, \nEquistar works with the area industry, the local fire department and the Local Emergency \nPlanning Committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release \ndoes occur.  Response activities have been discussed with the Local Emergency Planning \nCommittee and the Douglas County Mutual Aid Association.\n\nThe Tuscola Plant, in conjunction with local emergency responders, conducts emergency drills to ensure community wide preparedness in case of an incident at the plant.  The plant also hosts an annual community appreciation day to communicate our progress on safe work environment initiatives to local government officials, media, responders, members of the regulatory community and others.\n\nEvery second year, the plant holds a community open house with plant tours, demonstrations, \nexhibits and an opportunity for anyone to stop by and talk to plant management and other \nemployees.  Finally, anyone is welcome, at anytime, to call the plant and discuss anything of \nconcern.\n\nThrough the above outreach efforts, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays \nabreast of community concerns and works to address them. \n\n\n2.

To effectively implement these policies, Equistar has established a management system headed by the Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Department to oversee safety and environmental-related activities.\n\n\n\nEquistar's policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used, the chemical must be approved by the Chemical Control Committee by undergoing an environmental and safety analysis on the chemical to consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect the plant \n\nworkers, the public and the environment.  Any adverse effects must be addressed before the chemical is approved. \n\n\n\nEquistar strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility: Equistar is committed to the safety of workers, the public and the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Equistar implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, built, operated and maintained \n\nto reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, installation and operation of the equipment. Equistar uses Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.  In addition, Equistar requires \n\nthe documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the management of change process.

The Tuscola Plant also participates in auditing processes to measure and enhance its prevention program.\n\n\n\nEquistar's goal is to minimize impact from an accidental release: In the event of an accidental release, the Tuscola Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment. Equistar provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, conducts regular drills to review response activities and coordinates response efforts with area industry and the local emergency response agencies. Equistar trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, Equistar works with the area industry, the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  Response activities have been discussed with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Douglas County Mutual Aid Association.\n\n\n\nEquistar is an active participant in the community: The Tuscola Plant actively participates in and is committed to the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care(r) initiative. The plant, in conjunction with local emergency responders, conducts emergency drills to ensure community wide preparedness in case of an incident at the plant.  The plant also hosts an annual Responsible Care(r) Day to communicate our progress on the Responsible Care(r)  initiatives to local government officials, media, responders, members of the regulatory community and others.\n\n\n\nEvery second year, the plant holds a community open house with plant tours, demonstrations, exhibits and an opportunity for anyone to stop by and talk to plant management and other employees.

The stationary source and the regulated substances handled (? 68.155 b):\n\n\n\nEquistar's Tuscola Plant is located on an 800-acre site and began operations in 1953. The stationary source consists of ethanol and ether production, alcohol denaturing, specialty polymers, and support facilities. The Tuscola Plant's key products are ethyl alcohol, ethyl ether, powdered polyethylene and polypropylene (Microthene-F) and a compounded polyethylene product.  The plant also receives vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) and acetic acid for repackaging and shipment \n\nto customers. The feedstock used for ethanol and ether is ethylene. The feedstock for the powders and compounds is pelletized polymer produced at other Equistar sites.  All feedstock arrives at the facility by pipeline, railcar and/or truck.\n\n\n\nThe following facilities (processes) at the Tuscola Plant are covered under the RMP Rule: \n\nDenaturing Plant (includes Chemical Loading Area), Alcohol Plant (includes Synthesis and Finishing, Ether Purification Unit, and Tank Farm).
