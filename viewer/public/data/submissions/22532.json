For toxic gases, the entire contents of the tank are assumed to be released as a gas over a ten-minute period.  For toxic liquids, the entire contents of the tank are assumed to spill instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  The rat of release to air is determined from the volatilization rate of the liquid pool.  Passive mitigation measures (e.g. enclosures, dikes) may be taken into account.  The toxic endpoint is the threshold for serious injury from exposure to a toxic substance in the air.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  In reality, a vapor release would not occur, some quantity of anhydrous ammonia would remain in liquid form.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp, the EPA recommended software.  The toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L (200 PPM).  Based on 100,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 3.2-miles from the location of the storage tank.\r\n\r\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario for flammable subst"

During the  evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.\r\n\r\nHawkinsville Fertilizer, Inc. has incorporated a facility policy that limits the maximum filling capacity of all propane storage tanks to 88% at 60oF.  Therefore, our worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 67,000 pounds of propane from a 18,000 gallon storage tank.\r\n\r\nBased on 67,000 pounds of propane released, RMP*Comp calculated the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 0.2-mile from the location of the storage tank.\r\n\r\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia deemed most likely to occur at the facility is the failure of a flexible liquid transfer hose while transferring anhydrous ammonia from a transport to the storage tank.  The 3-inch flexible transfer hose is connected to iron piping.  Excess flow valves at the storage tanks and transport function to stop the flow of anhydrous ammonia out of the storage tank and transport.

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  We also handle propane, which the EPA considers a hazardous flammable gas.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia and propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat  to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia and propane, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nWe at Hawkinsville Fertilizer, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our  facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Pulaski Emergency Management which  provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nHawkinsville Fertilizer, Inc. sales anhydrous ammonia to area farmers as a source of nitrogen.
