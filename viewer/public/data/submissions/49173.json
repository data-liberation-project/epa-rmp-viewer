This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving both practices and measures to prevent the release of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, the Cimarron facility is prepared to work with the Grey Co LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of people and envirnment.  The Cimarron facility?s primary covered process activity is the mixing of fertilizers.  These activities include storage and processing of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and processed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic throughout the year.  Ammonia mixing with phosphoric acid occurs in a T-reactor.  Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The Emergency Response Procedures for Cimarron are coordinated with the Grey Co LEPC.\n                                                                                                                                                                                   United Suppliers, Inc.?Cimarron Ks has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.
