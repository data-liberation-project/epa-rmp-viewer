We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.  It is our policy to control our processes to prevent the accidental release of harmful or noxious materials that could endanger or irritate our employees, plant visitors, or neighbors.  This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\n\nHydrite uses two chemicals regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program and the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program.  These chemicals are Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  These chemicals are received in non-bulk truckloads ranging from 105 lb. to 2000 lb. containers. We have on-site storage of 62,000 pounds of chlorine and 14,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  These materials are stored as liquids under pressure.  Additionally, Hydrite distributes both Hydrofluoric acid 70% and Ethylenediamine which are covered by Risk Management but not OSHA's PSM program.  On-site storage of Hydrofluoric acid is 22,000 pounds and Ethylenediamine is  pounds.  All storage containers are designed to comply with National Standards including the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), OSHA, and the Chlorine Institute. \n\nWorst case scenario for each regulated substance is based on the total loss of the maximum quantity stored in each vessel.

Hydrite has elected to use the ALOHA modeling package to keep our scenarios comparable with the local emergency response providers.  The worst case scenario for Sulfur Dioxide has the greatest impact zone and does have off-site impacts.  The worst case scenario for Ethylenediamine does not have off-site impact and is a Program 1 process.\n\nAlternate scenarios for both gases were based on a fuseable plug failure on a ton container allowing the material in the container to be released through the 3/8\" opening for 15 minutes.   Weather conditions used were as specified in the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Modeling was conducted using ALOHA.  Due to ALOHA's inability to model aqueous solutions, Hydrite used RMP*Comp for modeling the aqueous Hydrofluoric acid scenarios.  These alternate scenarios have off-site impacts.  Program 1 process do not require an alternate scenario.\n\nHydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance.  Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process hazards.  Both processes are subject to the OSHA PSM program and as such, undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis.  Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemicals, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new chemicals.  Equipment maintenance procedures have been developed and implemented, including routine inspections and scheduled maintenance.  Hydrite Chemical believes that every incident has the potential for s"
