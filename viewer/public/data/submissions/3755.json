The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nDynaChem, Inc. management and on-site work force are firmly committed to safety.  Each level of management is directly responsible for the implementation of the Corporate Accident Prevention Program and responsible for the safety performance of their employees.  An active safety management team comprised of members from all departments participates in process hazard analysis and safety implementation review.  DynaChem, Inc. has a comprehensive training program.  Emergency Response is provided by the Georgetown Fire Department.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDynaChem is a chemical manufacturing plant supplying foundry chemicals and other resins.  The DynaChem, Inc. plant in Georgetown, IL is located in a rural, sparsely populated section of Vermilion County.  The plant uses two listed toxic chemicals above threshold quantities.  Epichlorohydrin is stored and used in the production of epoxy resins.  In another area of the facility, formaldehyde solution is stored for use in the production of phenolic resins. \n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nUpon analysis of the Worst case scenarios, only epichlorohydrin was potentially released in quantities sufficient to reach off-site receptors via air dispersion routes. The affected population was calculated using aerial photography, USGS quad maps, and census data.\n\nEpichlorohydrin's worst-case release volume was 72,393 pounds that being the entire quantity of the epichlorohydrin storage tank.  The epichlorohydrin storage tank is located within a passive mitigation system -- a diked area of sufficient volume to contain the entire spillage from the epichlorohydrin tank.  The dike has an enclosed passive mitigation area of 2379 square feet with a dike sidewall height of 0.73 feet.\n\nFormaldehyde's' worst case scenario was the release of the total volume of stored formaldeh"

The formaldehyde solution storage tank is located within a passive mitigation system -- a diked area of sufficient volume to contain the entire spillage from the formaldehyde storage tank.  The dike has an enclosed passive mitigation area of 1275 square feet with a sidewall height of 0.96 feet. \n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the Formaldehyde Phenolic Resin processes is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.  Within the last five years, the Formaldehyde Phenolic Resin processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental release.  In the event of fire, explosion, or release of a regulated substance from the Formaldehyde Phenolic Resin processes, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefor, public emergency responders should not enter the area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. These issues are discussed annually during the emergency response training.\n\nThe formaldehyde solution use constitutes a Program Level 1.\n\nEpichlorohydrin does potentially reach offsite residences at a distance of 0.6 miles that being the toxic endpoint for epichlorohydrin worst case scenario radii, and 0.2 miles for the alternate case scenario.  The alternate case scenario involves the release of epichlorohydrin during tanker truck unloading.  The epichlorohydrin tanker truck unloading is located within a passive mitigation system -- a diked area of sufficient volume to contain the entire spillage from the epichlorohydrin tanker truck.  The dike has an enclosed passive mitigation area of 749 square feet with a sidewall height of 1.0 feet.  The epichlorohydrin is delivered u"

Operators monitor the flow rate and line pressures as an indication of successful unloading.  \n\nThe calculations for the epichlorohydrin alternate scenario portray the release of epichlorohydrin assuming the 20 psi Nitrogen overpressurization system remains active throughout and that response mitigation time will exceed the time required to completely empty the epichlorohydrin tanker truck (45,000 pounds).  Response time given donning requirements for personal protective equipment and assemblage of response teams is estimated to be 15 minutes.  Even with these estimates, the alternate case toxic endpoint radii does not reach any public receptors or residences.  These assumptions are very conservative given the realization that the Nitrogen overpressure would be shutdown as soon as a tanker truck spill was occurring.   However, assuming multiple failures -- including failure of the Nitrogen overpressure shutdown system; this alternate scenario has been developed.\n\nThe epichlorohydrin use constitutes a Program Level 3 and DynaChem has a Program Level 3 Prevention Program for epichlorohydrin processes.\n\n4. The General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDynaChem has safety, quality control, and risk management programs that assure effective operator training and mandate a preventative maintenance program.  DynaChem has recently completed a comprehensive third party compliance audit and has analyzed both the epichlorohydrin and formaldehyde processes as to failure mode and effects.\n\nThe DynaChem site is secured with all visitors and contractors required to check in at the administrative offices.\n\n5.
