Actions from deviations can also allow for personnel to intervene by remote control room or on-site by persons by shutdown authorized policy allowing any individual the permission to bring the operation to a controlled state if there is an emergency. Trained and qualified personnel also have detection monitoring equipment to use manually if there is a need to detect and determine that there may be a unintended release of the regulated chemical/highly hazardous material.
