Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Delta Packing has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Delta Packing, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Delta Packing has updated and consolidated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                         | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nNorth Ammonia Refrigeration System     Anhydrous Ammonia           28,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation "

The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above each machinery room. A partial list of the systems components includes:\n\n\n\nNorth System\n\n\n\nThe North System is located at 6021 E Kettleman Ln, Lodi, CA 95240 and was originally built in 1979. Initially, the system had a single machinery room on the south side of building which provided refrigeration to five cold rooms and the hallway. In 2012, Industrial Refrigeration Services was hired to install a second machinery room, a cold storage room, and five (5) precool rooms.\n\nMachinery Room 1 (South)\n\n(3) Reciprocating compressors\n\n(1) Screw compressor\n\n(4) Oil separators\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Liquid transfer vessel\n\n(1) Main suction accumulator\n\nMachinery Room 1 Roof\n\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\n(1) Ventilation Fan\n\nNorth Room 1\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\nNorth Room 2\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\nNorth Room 3\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(2) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\nNorth Roo"

From the accumulator, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to a main suction accumulator. From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contain numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressur"

These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Delta Packing has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Delta Packing now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Delta Packing employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Delta Packing will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n\n"
