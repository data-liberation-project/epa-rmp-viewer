This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at out facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls prevents possible releases of regulated substances. Should an accidental release occur, P Chem, Inc. has worked with the local fire departments so they can plan for a response and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \r\nP Chem, Inc. primary activities are chemical manufacturing. Two regulated substances are contained in the facility in quantities greater than the threshold amount: ammonia (anhydrous) and formaldehyde (formalin solution). \r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative-Case Scenario\r\nP Chem, Inc. has developed a worse-case and alternative-case scenario, however it has been withheld form this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as required by the EPA.\r\n\r\nAccident Release Program  \r\nOur facility has taken steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR 68 of EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at out stationary source.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored and handled in accordance with the provisions of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Management\r\nPChem, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazard, operating parameters, and"

The methodology used to carry out the process hazard analyses (PHA) is HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations are revalidated at least every 5 years. The findings related to the PHA are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA revalidations were completed 8-28-12.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purpose of safety conducting activities within our covered processes, PChem, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown operations, and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to personnel involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nP Chem, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are competent in the operating in the operating procedure associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nP Chem, Inc. carries out documented maintenance checks on process and storage equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; process vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel trained in maintenance practices. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely matter.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at PChem, Inc.
