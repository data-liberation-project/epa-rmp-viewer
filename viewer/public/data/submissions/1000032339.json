As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1\tPITMAN FARMS - SANGER POULTRY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\n \r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name \t                    Process Chemical\t          Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nP1 - Ammonia Refrigeration\t    Ammonia\t                  18,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nPitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.

We have: \r\n1.\tPrepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\r\n2.\tOrganized the program so that it meshes closely with general Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry business practices\r\n3.\tUtilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\r\n\r\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nSanger Poultry operates a processing plant and freezer for poultry products that utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to provide refrigeration capacity to the following areas:\r\n\u00bf\tCooler\r\n\u00bf\tProcessing Room\r\n\u00bf\tBlast Room 1-3\r\n\u00bf\tBlast Room 4\r\n\u00bf\tShell and Tube Heat Exchanger\r\n\r\nThe system utilizes pumped liquid recirculators where high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to a liquid recirculator(s) through a liquid feed solenoid valve and an expansion valve.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into the evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through check valves and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure ammonia gas is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver. \r\n\r\nThe facility was built more than twenty five years ago, but since that time the following projects have occurred:\r\n\u00bf\tMay 2011 - Ice Makers were moved and a vertical liquid recirc package was installed outsid"

Therefore, the system is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\n1.3.1\tGENERAL \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nPitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \r\n\r\n1.3.2\tANHYDROUS AMMONIA\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nPitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has had one (1) accidental release with"

Nevertheless, Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nPitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
