      "SummaryText": "Guardian Lima, LLC (Lima) is an ethanol fuel production plant located in Lima, Ohio in Allen County. The facility was originally known as Greater Ohio Ethanol. Lima has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chemical stored on-site that exceeds reporting thresholds as a requirement of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Greater Ohio Ethanol began operations in 2009 but was shut down soon after. Guardian Lima began operations in May 2011.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nLima is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.  In the event of a significant emergency, including an accidental release of flammable materials, it is the policy of Guardian Lima to initiate activities in its Emergency Action Plan, notify appropriate response authorities, and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGuardian Lima uses natural gasoline as a denaturant for its final product.  The natural gasoline is classified as a NFPA 4 flammable mixture containing pentane. The tank is located outdoors in a diked area.  The facility no longer utilizes aqueous ammonia, which was previously regulated as a RMP toxic chemical. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard at 29 CFR 1910.119, Guardian Lima has complied with EPA requirements at 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program and PSM Program are con"

      "SummaryText": "ducted on a 3-year cycle to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History \n\nGuardian Lima does not have a history of accidents involving regulated chemcials which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nGuardian Lima has developed response efforts to a variety of potential scenarios involving hazardous substances stored and used at the facility. These efforts have been coordinated with state and federal regulating agencies and local responders. Guardian Lima also participates in the SING Group to ensure adequate fire suppression equipment are available in case of an emergency.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs previously mentioned, Guardian Lima is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. Guardian Lima management is committed to promoting a safe work environment. Guardian Lima will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support needed to conduct their work safely and to operate the ethanol production process in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n"
