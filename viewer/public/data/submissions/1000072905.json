The facility processes raw water from the Columbia River into drinking water for the City of Pasco.  The plant was built in 1948, and expanded in 1958 and 1986.\n\n\n\nChemical of Concern:\n\nThe facility uses chlorine gas for disinfection.   \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program :\n\nThe facility implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (WAC 296-67), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The disinfection system has built in safety features including automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, check valves, leak detectors and emergency shutdown devices. System operation is continuously monitored by a computerized control system.\n\n\n\nThe disinfection system is routinely serviced and inspected by qualified personnel. Plant operators are trained to minimize the risk of releases. Site security measures and continuous monitoring systems are also in place at the facility. \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in significant property damage on site or known offs"

Management is committed to maintaining a safe facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan per WAC 296-824 to facilitate safe responses to accidental chlorine releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety of the disinfection system is improved continuously through internal and external audits and inspections, utilization of the process hazard analysis procedure, safety committee meetings, employee suggestions, and as the result of incident and near-miss investigations. The system is modern and upgrades have occurred on a regular basis since construction. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
