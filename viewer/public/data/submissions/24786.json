The material gets transported into the building from the outside tank by pipeline.  The material is used to fill containers of two types:  1 gallon polyethylene bottles and bulk containers (modular chemical vessels 100 and 200 gallon).  After the containers are filled, a sample is analyzed for purity and the material sent to the customer or placed in the warehouse for storage.\n\nThe Air Liquide America Corp. owns and operates an Air Separation Unit (ASU) at 13140 TI Blvd. in Dallas, TX. The primary function of the facility is to supply bulk gasses (Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon and Hydrogen) to our customer via pipeline on a 24 hour, 365-day basis. The facility accomplishes this by separating constituent gasses of the atmosphere, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Argon by process of distillation. The facility manufactures Hydrogen by process of catalytic reformation. \n\nDuring the process of manufacturing Hydrogen, Propane is combined with steam at high temperatures, which causes a reaction releasing Hydrogen. The Propane is chemically changed, not burned. \n\nThe Propane is stored in a vertical, single-walled 18,000-gallon tank.\nThe tank is equipped with the following:\n\n1.) Gauges and internal piping, ensuring a maximum of 85% fill capacity.\n2.) Overpressure relief valve on the top of the tank\n3.) Backflow prevention on the fill line.\n4.) Fail-closed emergency shut-off valves, held open by Propane backpressure delivered through a\nconsumable tubing system.  This tubing will burn in case of fire, shutting off the tank. \n5.) Liquid level rate-of-change alarm. \n6.) Relief valves on the pump's piping\n7.) Process alarms and interlocks in the downstream processes, sensitive to flows, steam to carbon ratios,\n pressures, temperatures and levels.\n8.) Manual emergency shutdown levers.\n9.) Nearby water cannons.\n10.) Area electrical classification and con"
