Johns Manville is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\r\nThis facility manufactures polyisocyanurate insulation panels for the construction industry.  A flammable mixture containing two regulated substances, pentane and isopentane, is used in the manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\r\nThe hypothetical worst-case scenario is a failure of the 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (90%), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to hazard modeling software, using worst-case assumptions, impacts from this explosion could cause injuries and damage to persons or property located in an area between the storage tank and the hazard endpoint.  The hazard endpoint, in this case, corresponds to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) and is estimated to extend 0.4 miles from the storage tank.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves a hose rupture caused by a truck that pulls away while the hose is still connected to the pentane tank.  This would result in a spill of approximately 7 gallons (this amount is the maximum quantity of pentane that could be contained in the hose).  If a spark were to ignite the spilled liquid and vapors, the resulting explosion could impact persons or property within 150 feet of the unloading area.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of a pentane release in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Admininistration (OSHA) Process Safety Manage"

      "SummaryText": "ment (PSM) standard and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program are described below.\r\n\r\n* An in-depth Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the system was conducted prior to start-up and was re-validated within the first five years of operating the system.  Numerous risk reduction measures have been implemented as a result of the PHA.  Qualified personnel revalidate the PHA every five years.\r\n\r\n* The pentane system was designed in accordance with applicable codes and standards (NFPA, ANSI, ASME, etc.).  A Pre-Start Review confirmed that construction and equipment comply with desing specifications.\r\n\r\n* Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who will receive refresher training at least every three years.\r\n\r\n* Critical equipment is maintained, tested, and inspected on a planned, periodic basis to ensure proper operating conditions.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nThere have been no accidents involving pentane.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nA written emergency action plan is maintained at the facility, and our personnel are trained in proper notification and evacuation procedures.  In the event of an emergency, this facility would request immediate assistance from the Hazle Township Volunteer Fire and Rescue Company.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\nSafety has been a part of the working culture at Johns Manville for many years.  The pentane process is currently state of the art and is designed and maintained to be as safe as feasibly possible.  At this time, no further improvements are planned."
