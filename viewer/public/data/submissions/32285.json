Staley Manufacturing Company-Loudon are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass the manufacture of sweeteners and corn syrups utilizing the corn wetmilling process.  We have one regulated substance at our facility.  This substance is Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is used to control microbial growth during the corn steeping process and also weakens the starch-gluten bonds so the separation process following steeping is more efficient.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide at our facility is 144,000 lb.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and the alternate release scenarios we have used EPA?s RMP Guidance for WasteWater Treatment Plants.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted involves a catastrophic release from the Sulfur Dioxide tank.  In this scenario 144,000 lb. Of Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is released in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography the maximum distance of 13 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L.\n\n\nTHE SULFUR DIOXIDE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves the break of the 2? transfer line between a Sulfur Dioxide truck and the bulk Sulfur Dioxide tank.  The scenario involves the release of 18,000 lbs. of Sulfur Dioxide.  The existing controls prevent"

The toxic gas will be released to the atmosphere with no passive mitigation to control the release rate.  Under neutral weather conditions of class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed and assuming urban topography the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur Dioxide is 0.4 miles.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC \n\nPREVENTION STEPS\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30 Standard, 1957 edition.  Non-combustible chemical storage systems were designed and are maintained in conformance with applicable ANSI standards and chemical supplier recommendations.
