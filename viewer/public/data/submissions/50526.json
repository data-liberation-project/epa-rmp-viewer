Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: A. Process safety information B. Process hazard analysis C. Operating procedures D. Training E. Mechanical integrity F. Management of change H. Pre-startup review I. Compliance audits J. Incident investigation K. Employee participation L. Hot Work Permits M. Contractors As part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps: Preventive Maintenance with Daily, Weekly, and Monthly maintenance tasks and inspections. Employee Training with class room training, written test and on the job training. Written instructions for operation and maintenance of the chlorine system. We are in compliance with the Process Safety Management Rule. Chlorine ton tanks have Halogen Actuators that shut the tanks of if the chlorine leak detector detects a leak. We also have a US Filter Chlorine Scrubber that turns on and draws the gas out of the chlorine room if the chlorine leak detector alarms in which it is scrubbed with a 15% solution of sodium hydroxide converting it sosium chloride. These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. The Water Treatment Plant is commited to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountibilities and controls to ensure that wee are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. 5.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY We have not had any significant accidental chemical"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan."
