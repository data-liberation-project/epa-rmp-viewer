This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Salina Fire Department and the Saline County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n \n\n-The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n \n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity. Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for the Schwan's frozen pizza operations. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Schwan's is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations. \n\n\n\n\n\n-Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*eSubmit document.\n\n \n\nTo evaluate both the worst case, and alternative release off site consequence analysis, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Schwan's RMP Plan on file at the facility."

To meet these necessary requirements Schwan's has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\n \n\n-Accident History \n\n\n\nThere has been one RMP Ammonia Release Incident in the previous five years.  This event is detailed in the Accident History section.  The off-site evacuations is listed as zero because it was a voluntary evacuation.\n\n\n\n-Emergency Response Plan \n\n\n\nThis Schwan's facility has developed an Emergency Response Plan. It is a detailed document that discusses the role of employees in an emergency. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuation of plant personnel. All emergency response personnel, (FIRST RESPONDERS) have completed required emergency training in accordance with 29 CFR1910.120.\n\n \n\nThe emergency response team has approximately 25 members, all trained at the 24-hour technician level by the corporate environmental compliance manager, specialized 3rd party vendor or Salina Fire Department and Saline County Emergency Management Agency. Training emphasizes ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, protective equipment including use of level \"A\" suits and interaction with an incident command system (ICS). Emergency plans are filed with the local fire department and annual walk-throughs are conducted with fire officers. Pre-planned command posts and staging areas are designated and IC transfer and liaison protocols have been established. Post incident de-briefings are conducted.\n\n \n\nThe plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facilit"

However, the processes will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Schwan's personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration processes. \n\n"
