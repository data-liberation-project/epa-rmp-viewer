The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also require strict observance to certain safety precautions in order to reduce the threat to the employees and surrounding community.  Our policy strives to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which chlorine is handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility and the training of the personnel.\n\nMuch of the emergency response program is based upon the procedures established in the Capital Controls Group ?Operation and Maintenance Manual? prepared for the facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\nThe primary purpose of the Denison Water Treatment Plant is to clean and disinfect water to be used by the City of Denison and rural neighbors for potable purposes.  Chlorine is shipped by truck to the plant in 2,000-pound cylinders.  The chlorine cylinders are unloaded from trucks into the chlorine room, which is separated from the rest of the plant building.  The maximum amount of chlorine that is stored at the plant at any time is 8,000 pounds.  \n  \nThe Denison Water Treatment Facility has worked to comply with the EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 requirements.  All of our employees have been trained in chlorine response procedures.  \n\nThe Denison Water Treatment Plant has not had an accidental release of chlorine from the covered processes within the past five years.  \n\nThe Facility?s Emergency Response Program is built around the Operation and Maintenance Manual prepared for it, specifically, the troubleshooting charts.
