      "SummaryText": "The AmerenCIPS Newton Generating Station is located on Newton Lake in Jasper County approximately 8 miles southwest of the city of Newton.  Newton Plant began producing electricity in 1977.  One ton chlorine cylinders have been safely used at the Newton Plant for the past 22 years.  The plant typically uses 24,000 pounds of chlorine each year to prevent biofouling of equipment associated with the WaterTreatment Plant.  Chlorine is continuously added to the feed water for the Water Treatment Plant which produces ultra pure water for boiler makeup.  This chlorination system has been periodically upgraded and has been safely operated for the past 22 years without any significant releases or injuries.  The importance of preventing any releases is stressed through on the job training for employees entering job responsibilities in this work area.  All plant employees are required to review the chlorine safety training materials annually.   In addition, the system is equipped with chlorine leak detection monitors and  leak checks are performed during routine maintenence.   The chlorine cylinders are located on the east side of the Water Treatment Plant which is along a frequently travelled plant road by both operations and maintenence personnel. This location facilitates the early detection of any abnormal conditions.  The chlorine injection system is a vacuum induced flow through a regulator and a v-notch flow controller. If, for any reason, the vacuum is lost, then the regulator will close and the feed for the injection system will be shut off.  In addition, there is a chlorine gas detector located near the chlorine cylinders which is used to detect any leakage from the cylinders or associated piping.  Should this sensor detect the presence of chlorine gas, an alarm will sound in the Water Treatment Plant and in the main control room of the generating plant."
