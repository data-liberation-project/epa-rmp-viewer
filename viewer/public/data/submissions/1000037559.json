      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68 and the State of California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the concentration and quantity of aqueous ammonia is below the OSHA thresh hold quantity.  This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of aqua ammonia from the Butte City Retail Facility located at Highway 45 & Highway 162 in Butte, City, Ca. 95920.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Butte City Retail Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Butte City Retail Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as a 5-yer update.  It is important to note that there have not been any changes to this covered process since the last update.  The Facility has reviewed the OCA, Program Level, Operating Procedures, Safety Procedures, and Mechanical Integrity procedures and have determined that there are no changes.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Butte City Retail Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility that stores aqueous ammonia in one 14,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The 14,000-gallon storage tank is vented to a 1,000-gallon storage tank to scrub ammonia emissions.  Aqueous ammonia is transported to this facility via a commercial tanker truck and transferred to the 14,000-gallon storage tank by the Vendor/Contractor.  The Facility Process Operators transfer the aqueous ammonia from the 14,000-gallon storage tank in"

      "SummaryText": "to a facility operated transport truck (or a Vendor owned/operated commercial tanker truck) for delivery to local farmers for direct application.  In the field, the Facility Process Operators transfer the aqueous ammonia from the delivery truck into a poly-tank.    \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for the aqua ammonia storage process. The worst-case scenario release for the Butte City Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released (14,000-gallon).  The release was modeled as if the aqua ammonia tank had a catastrophic failure and the contents were released and contained within the diked secondary containment.  The vapor emission rate of the chemicals was calculated using standard equations recommended by U.S. EPA for such analyses.  The fate and transport of the evaporated ammonia was modeled via a standard U.S. EPA screening air dispersion model, SCREEN3.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a loading or unloading operation.  The vapor release rates and fate and transport of the evaporated ammonia was managed the same as the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Depot Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Depot Manager is responsible for conducting aqua ammonia process operations in accordance with this RMP and is responsible for the relevant maintenance, training procedures and documentation.  Upon request, a copy of its Risk Management Plan, Contingency Plan, and Operating Procedures will be provided to its contractors and auditing agency.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena Chemical Company's Butte City Retail Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local f"

The RMP will be updated as the Butte City Retail Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Region III, CA LEPC.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Butte City Retail Facility."
