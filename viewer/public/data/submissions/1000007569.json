The release occurred/contained inside the process area.\nOn 6/14/07 @ 12:30 PM this incident was reported to both NRC (Incident#838636) and ILEMA (Incident# H20070810).\nEffective 11/08/07, the facility's new name is: Evonik Goldschmidt Corporation. Previous name was: Degussa/Goldschmidt Chemical Corporation.\nOn 8/08/08 @ 10:45 AM this accident was reported to both NRC and ILEMA (Incident# 20081217).The release occurred/contained inside the process area. \n\nIntroduction:\n\nEvonik Goldschmidt Corporation, Mapleton facility, is resubmitting the fully updated Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the recent revisions to the Chemical Accident Prevention Regulation (40 CFR 68.190).\n\nOriginally the Mapleton site submitted the RMP on June 21, 1999.\n\nOn August 31, 1999, the WITCO CORPORATION's Oleochemicals portions of the Mapleton Plant and the WITCO CORPORATION's Metal Alkyl portion of the business at the Mapleton facility were divided into separate ownership.  The Oleochemicals portion of the Mapleton Plant site is now owned and operated as Evonik Goldschmidt Corporation.  The Metal Organic portion is now owned and operated by Chemtura Corporation.  This RMP document covers the portion of the Mapleton Plant owned by Degussa/Goldschmidt Chemical Corporation.  The previously submitted RMP Document I.D. #[1000 0014 7405] under Witco Corporation ownership covered both of these operations.  In November 1999, a re-submittal was made with ownership changes.  \n\nFor purposes of brevity, in this document the owner and operator of the Evonik Goldschmidt Corporation of the Mapleton Plant will be referred to as \"Evonik\". Evonik is committed to providing the processes, facilities, standards, resources, training, discipline, and work culture to ensure 1) a safe environment for all employees and for the communities in which we operate; 2) safe, effective products for our "

Approximately 200 employees operate this 24 hour per day, 7 day a week facility, which processes natural fats and oils into intermediates for consumer products and industrial type products.  Our finished products are used in hundreds of consumer products, including shampoos, conditioners, skin lotions, sun screens, fabric softeners, and household cleaners, as well as in many industrial processes as lubricants, paper debonders, textile finishes, mining flotation reagents, asphalt emulsifiers, adhesives, curing agents, biocides, and blowing agents.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nOn May 20, 1999, the entire Mapleton Plant representing Witco Corporation, at that time, joined with our neighboring facility Lonza to present all Risk Management Plans to the Mapleton Community.  There were about 20 members from our plants present, 10 Community Action Program (CAP) Committee members present, and about 10 members from the Mapleton Community.  The plan was received well.  All questions were answered.  The event was covered by the news media with a small article that appeared in the local paper the next day.\n\nIn our opinion, this event meets the Public Meeting requirement set forth in the new \"Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act\", Public Meetings and other Notifications Law, PL 106-40 [August 5, 1999].\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of our manufacturing processes that utilize those chemicals that fall under the EPA's RMP regulations.  The Evonik Mapleton production facilities fall under the Level 3 processes.  The Mapleton facility uses four toxic chemicals that fall into this program.  The toxic chemi"

The community population numbers were obtained using Landview III, form the Census Bureau.  There are many more complicated programs available that should be used for emergency planning but RMP-Comp can be used for the planning for this document.\n\nWorst Case Scenario/TOXIC:\n\nDeleted - per revised requirements.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios/TOXIC:\n\nThe alternate release scenario for acrylonitrile involves the release of 1,000 pounds of acrylonitrile from the adduct reactor/blow tank due to a failure in the control logic for the valve in the acrylonitrile addition line.  The toxic end point (0.076 mg/l) according to RMP Comp is 0.2 mile.  The release duration is 30 minutes.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is 88.1 pounds per minute leaking from a broken pipe on the ammonia transfer pump.  The line leaks for 30 minutes until the Emergency Response Team arrives and establishes a water spray onto the pump.  The toxic end point (0.14 mg/l) according to RMP Comp is 0.2 mile.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario for formaldehyde is a 3/8-inch line leaking at the transfer pump at the formaldehyde storage tank.  The material leaks into a diked area for 30 minutes until the Emergency Response Team arrives, suits up, and stops the leak.  The toxic end point (0.012 mg/l) according to RMP Comp is 0.1 mile.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for methyl chloride is due to an automatic valve opening due to a computer malfunction causing the release of 1,200 pounds of methyl chloride over a 30 minute period.  The material leaks into a tank vent discharging onto the building roof.  The toxic end point (0.82 mg/l) according to RMP Comp is 0.1 mile.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nEvonik complies with OSHA's PSM rule an"

This includes the following elements:\n\n- Employees are well trained and are our most important resource in operating our facility and in protecting our community.\n- Mechanical Integrity testing for major pieces of process equipment like metal fatigue and thickness testing.\n- Comprehensive technical hazard reviews conducted at least every 5 years on processes using these RMP regulated chemicals and on design changes for production units before the changes are made.  An excellent record keeping software program allows similar situations to be compared.\n- Distributed control systems are used throughout the plant.  They are interconnected which allows control to be shifted to another control station in the event of a computer system failure until full capability is restored.\n- We have highly sensitive monitoring instrumentation available that will detect very low concentrations of these materials.\n- The key to minimizing the effect of an accidental release is to get the right people and equipment to the location quickly.
