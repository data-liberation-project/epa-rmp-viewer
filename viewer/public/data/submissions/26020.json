The stationary source is involved in production of various milk and dairy products.  Ammonia liquified under pressure is the only regulated chemical exceeding a threshold quantity under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n         Upstate Farms Cooperative, Inc. proactively uses the OSHA Process Safety Management program required under 29 CFR 1910.119, in conjunction with the additional off-site considerations covered in the 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D, as an accidental release prevention program.  These documents are considered working programs and are used by facility personnel as the procedural standards for preventing accidental releases.  \n\n          Emergency response policies for the facility include an integration of the plans required under 29 CFR 1910.38(a) \"Emergency Action Plan\", 40 CFR Part 355 \"Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know\", 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management\", and 40 CFR Part 68 \"Risk Management Program\".  Integration of these programs for the Upstate Farms Cooperative, Inc. facility increases the usefullness of the emergency preparedness activities by decreasing the burden associated with maintaining multiple programs.  In general, Upstate Farms Cooperative, Inc. performes only very minor emergency response measures with properly trained in-house personnel, however, local emergency response agencies handle all major emergencies.  Community notification policies are in place in the event of an emergency with potential off-site impacts.  \n\n         The accidental release prevention program integrates the OSHA Process Safety Management program required under 29 CFR 1910.119 and the additional off-site considerations covered in 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D, as an accidental release prevention program.  One of the most important aspects of the prevention program is adherance to the mechanical integrity portion o"

      "SummaryText": "f the PSM Program, using specific standards established for the ammonia refrigeration industry by the equipment manufacturer and/or the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).\n\n          The worst-case scenario release involves a complete release of the largest ammonia vessel, which is the receiver and thermosyphon vessel, from the ammonia refrigeration system.  This entails an unmitigated release of 9,675 pounds of ammonia over a ten minute period.  The endpoint distance of 1.20 miles was calculated using Exhibit 4-4 in the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Offices's document \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68)\".  \n\n          The alternate release scenario involves the venting of a relief valve from the ammonia refrigeration system.  The orifice of the relief valve is 1.0 inch in diameter and the release occurs at a pressure of 180 PSI.  Referring to Exhibit 4-6 in the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office's document \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68)\", an endpoint distance of 0.30 miles results.  The total duration of the alternative release was designated as two minutes resulting in an ammonia release of approximately 4,200 pounds.  \n\n         There have been no reportable accidents in the past five (5) years.  \n\n          Planned changes to improve safety at the facility include an electrical upgrade throughout the plant."
