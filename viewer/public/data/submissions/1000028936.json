The facility promotes safety and environmental responsibility by implementing systems that help minimize the potential for catastrophic releases of chemicals that could affect worker safety and environment.  The Facility's Emergency Response Plan along with the Local Emergency Planning Committee systematically controls emergency response activities and promotes worker and environmental safety, as well as public health.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage at the Facility within the past 5 years. \n\n\n\nThe Facility is regulated under the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Spill Compensation and Control Act (N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11) and has developed a Discharge Prevention, Containment and Countermeasure / Discharge Cleanup and Removal (DPCC / DCR) Plan in accordance with those requirements.  Best Management Practices (BMP's) have been identified and implemented to ensure practices and procedures are conducted in a manner that ensures continual improvement in the safe handling of hazardous materials.  Compliance with BMP's as well as this Risk Management Plan is verified by conducting internal audits on a regular basis (at least monthly).\n\n\n\nb.
