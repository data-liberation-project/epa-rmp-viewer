This facility is a farm cooperative.   We store and provide for application, anhydrous ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia system consists of one 18,00 gallon storage tank  The ammonia supplied by the vendor's bulk tanker, and is used to fill nurse tanks.  The nurse tank filling procedure is performed by our own  employees.                              .                                                                                                                                                                           THE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS.   Per the EPA requirements, we performed a worst-case release scenario, and reviewed alternative release senarios for a release of anhydrous ammonia from our storage tank system at this site.  The information was used to perform an off-site consequence analysis .  Descriptions of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, and the results of the off-site consequence analyses  are included in Section 2 of this document.                  .
