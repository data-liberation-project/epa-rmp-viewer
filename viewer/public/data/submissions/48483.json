Chlorine is held in 150-lb cylinders.  If accidental spillages occur, the affected individuals would be only those that are in the immediate vicinity and are physically impaired to move away from the area of spillage.  The effects of chlorine if inhaled affect the respiratory system.  The main effect is coughing uncontrollably until the chlorine is expelled from the lungs.  It also irritates the eyes when in contact with chlorine.  Staff working with chlorine has been trained to use ammonia to detect leaks.\n\nZapata County Waterworks at 909 Jackson is a treatment facility.  It processes raw water taken from Falcon Lake into potable water. At the highest level there are 4,500 pounds of chlorine available.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in water treatment.\n\nThe system has the MSDS sheets available.  There is an open container of ammonia available at all times so that the ammonia will indicate a leak before the staff gets to the chlorine room.  At that point, staff is instructed to call for backup assistance and to get in touch with the Fire Department so that they may assist with the self contained breathing apparatus to repair the cause of the leak.\n\nThe leaks that have occurred within the last five years have been minimal.  The ammonia bottles have detected them before they have become a danger.  The leaks have been of less than a pound per leak.  No one has been injured and no one has been evacuated.\n\nIn case of accidental spillage, the local Fire Department and the EMS staff are aware that their support is indispensable and have cooperated in assisting with the self-contained apparatus and in being available to evacuate the public if needed.  The local staff of Firefighters and EMS also provides training and refilling the self-contained apparatus.\n\nIn continuing with the safe operation of water"
