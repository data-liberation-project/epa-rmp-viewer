The Dairy Farmers of America DMD facility is part of a cooperative, owned and operated by the area dairy farmers.  Dairy Farmers of America is one of the country's most diversified U.S. manufacturers of dairy products, food components and ingredients and is the premium provider of market opportunities for farmers and a value-added supplier of innovative dairy products and food components for customers around the world.\n\nThe Dairy Farmers of America, Inc. DMD facility's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The facility maintains an employee Safety Committee. The emergency coordinator is the Plant Manager / Maintenance Manager.  Dairy Farmers of America has a corporate structure to support the DMD team in regards to compliance issues including Emergency Action Plan activities.  The Action Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at needed.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Dairy Maid Dairy facility is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia (12,414 pounds), from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the processing and cold storage of seafood products.\n\nNOTE: The quantity"

      "SummaryText": "in this submittal is provided based on the EPA rule of reporting two significant digits. However the Worst Case Release in the Hazard Assessment is based on the actual inventory of 12,414 pounds. \n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 30 psig on the low pressure side of the system to approximately 165 psig on the high side. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM).\n\nAdministrative Measures:  The facility operates and maintains the refrigeration system in accordance with established industry standards.\n\nThe DFA Dairy Maid Dairy ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over-pressurization.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe EPA RMP defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\"The release must be from"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\u00bf\tsave lives;\n\u00bf\tminimize and avoid injuries;\n\u00bf\tprotect the environment; and\n\u00bf\tminimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated as needed.  \n\nPlant personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Plant Manager.  The Plant Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, initially performed March 2019, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve"
