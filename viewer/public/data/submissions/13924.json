Personnel are trained in safe equipment operation to reduce the potential for accidental release of toxic materials and/or ignition of flammable substances.  Plant personnel are advised to report all releases and unsafe conditions to the plant manager and/or company president immediately.  As part of any emergency response action, appropriate Intercoastal personnel are trained to contact the Texas City Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Texas City Fire Department (currently the Texas City LEPC), contracted emergency response teams, company president, plant manager, and other pertinent emergency and/or regulatory agencies immediately.  Intercoastal Terminal does not have the equipment and trained personnel necessary to be the sole responder to a catastrophic release.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPersonnel receive basic safety training and are aware of emergency response procedures.    Intercoastal emergency response activities are supported by contracts with emergency response professionals (currently Garner Environmental).  Intercoastal currently stores and drums Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) under contract with Bayer Corporation.  Under this contract Bayer will respond on-site to help mitigate, neutralize, and clean up TDI releases.   Intercoastal personnel respond directly to small releases of toxic chemicals.  Intercoastal maintains a written emergency response plan that describes the responsibilities of plant personnel in the event of an accidental release or other emergency (e.g., fires, explosions, unsafe conditions, injuries).

      "SummaryText": " operates a bulk product terminal located in Texas City, Texas (Galveston, County).  The terminal receives, stores, and ships petroleum and industrial chemical liquids for various clients.  The facility is located in a highly industrialized area of Texas City surrounded by both petroleum refineries and other bulk storage terminals. Materials are received and shipped through marine docks (typically by barge) and tank trucks.  At the time of this report, typical operation is receipt of materials by tank truck or barge and transfer out by barge.  Little material is shipped out by tank truck.  Intercoastal stores the liquid materials in twelve above-ground atmospheric storage tanks.   \n\nCommon materials stored at the site include various grades of fuel oil, gasoline blend stock, and petroleum refinery fractions.  In addition, Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is currently stored on-site.  TDI is received by tank truck and unloaded into an atmospheric storage tank (currently Tank 11-11).  The TDI is transferred from the tank and loaded into drums.  The drums are placed into shipping containers which are shipped off-site.  No other regulated toxic chemicals (above listed threshold quantities) are currently handled at the facility.    Intercoastal receives, ships, and/or stores flammable petroleum mixtures such as naphtha.\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nTerminal processes (e.g., marine loading/unloading, truck loading/unloading, material storage, drum filling) are integrated and within close proximity of one another  (facility total area is approximately 5 acres).  The worst-case and alternative release scenarios were therefore based on the terminal being a single integrated process.  The worst-case and alternative release analysis for toxic chemicals focuses on TDI unloading, storage, and drum filling operations.   The toxic chemical worst-case scenario assumes that a storage tank is ruptured and the entire TDI content (Tank 11-11 capacity of 3"

The distance to the TDI toxic endpoint of 0.007 mg/l was estimated to be 0.31 miles off-property.  The alternative release scenario for TDI is a drum spill (or overfill) that releases the entire drum content of 55 gallons resulting in a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.1 mile.  \n\nThe most flammable substances handled at the terminal - at the time of this report - are naphtha and petroleum refinery fraction type liquid mixtures that are used in gasoline blendstock (unfinished gasoline product that is blended on-site).  The naphtha and blendstock can be stored in any of three internal floating roof (IFR) storage tanks.  The worst-case scenario for flammable substances was assumed to be a vapor cloud explosion of the total content (11,000,000 lb) of all three IFR tanks simultaneously,  resulting in a distance to over pressure end point of 1.9 miles.  The alternate scenario was assumed to be a liquid pool (6500 lbs naphtha released) fire that would produce harmful radiation (potential for 2nd degree burns) out to 405 feet from the fire's center.  This scenario could be the result of a tank overfill, pipeline break or similar release that forms a pool that ignites.  No flammable gases above threshold quantities are handled at the site at the time of this report.\n\nAt the time of this report, the nearest residential receptors (i.e., privately owned residences, schools, parks) are over 1 mile from the terminal.  Industrial receptors (e.g., guard shacks, industrial canal),  that may be considered public receptors for RMP purposes, are within the toxic and distance to over pressure end points estimated in this report.  Residential receptors are within the distance to over pressure end point for the worst-case analysis of a flammable substance vapor cloud explosion only.  Residential receptors are not within the toxic endpoint for a worst-case or alternative case TDI release or"

No deaths or serious on-site injuries have been recorded during the same period.\n\n\nDocument Management System\n\nIntercoastal terminal's plant manager has the responsibility to develop, implement, and integrate the risk management program elements.  \n\n\nGeneral Accident Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe safe handling of TDI is a primary concern for facility personnel, Intercoastal management, and Bayer Corporation (current supplier of TDI).  Bayer Corporation provides on-site safety seminars for Intercoastal personnel.  Bayer Corporation has emergency response staff available in the Houston-Galveston-Texas City area trained in mitigating, neutralizing, and clean-up of TDI releases.  Bayer Corporation has provided emergency contact number (currently (281) 383-6700) for Intercoastal personnel in the case of a TDI release .  Garner Environmental Services, Inc.

Personnel are trained to report situations that may result in accidents (e.g., equipment wear and/or malfunctions, unsafe practices, etc..) to the plant manager and superiors.  Intercoastal personnel are empowered to take action to reduce potential unsafe conditions.\n\nIntercoastal personnel are trained to handle flammable and highly flammable substances in a safe manner to reduce the potential for release, fire, and/or explosion.
