To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nU.S. Growers maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the cooling system at the U.S. Growers facility.  The ammonia is circulated throughout the system using pressure differentials created by compressors and pumps.  The pipes that carry the refrigerant are insulated for maintaining temperatures and pressures.  Compressor discharge lines are not insulated to facilitate the cooling process before arrival at the condensers.  \n\nHigh pressure liquid ammonia is circulated via exterior insulated pipelines to evaporator coils throughout the cold storage facility.  Ammonia is vaporized in the evaporators and returned to the compressors.  The ammonia vapor is returned to the booster compressors, intercoolers, high stage compressors, and finally, the condensers where the high pressure vapor is condensed to high pressure liquid ammonia.  \n\n Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n The total ammonia inventory is 10,500 pounds.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary:\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the tota"

The high pressure receiver (on the Engine Room roof) is the largest vessel in the system (witha capacity of 1100 gallons of ammonia, approximately 6050 pounds of ammonia) and is assumed to be filled to capacity for the worst case scenario.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 m/s and F stability.  This facility is located in an urban setting.  The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-4 from EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\", November 1998.  This potential release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nThe alternative release scenario was that of a 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 7560 pounds.  This release could occur due to a gasket rupture, pinhole leak, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, etc. In addition, this release could occur outside; therefore passive mitigation measures were not utilized. The meteorological conditions used were 3 m/s and D stability. This facility is located in an urban setting.  The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-5 from EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\", November 1998.

Special attention is directed to but not limited to:\n\n  AHSI/ASHREA 15-1989 - Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\n  ANSI/IIAR 2-1984 - Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems\n  ANSI BB31.5-1983 - Refrigeration Piping\n  ASME - Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX\n  UMC - Uniform Mechanical Code\n  UFC - Uniform Fire Code\n  NFPA - Fire Protection\n  UBC - Uniform Building Code, 1991, Seismic Zone 3\n\nEngineering Measures:\nThe ammonia system uses a computer system to bring equipment on-line, off-line, control the hot gas (compressor discharge) defrosting process, manipulate solenoid valves, and monitor the system for alarms.

The purpose of these meetings is to inform all maintenance employees of any changes in the system, operating procedures, and any changes that might occur in the regulations.\n\nThe \"Crisis Emergency Response Hazardous Materials\" document (CER) is designed to assure proper protection during a crisis/emergency situation.  In the event of an emergency that could threaten human health or the environment, the Emergency Coordinator shall assess the situation and determine if area evacuations are necessary.  The EC will notify the local authorities and surrounding areas.  The EC is the primary contact for the local authorities when they arrive at the scene.   This individual will oversee the management of the overall operation.  \n\nIt is the responsibility of the supervisor/lead person to sound an alarm when a situation occurs that requires evacuation.  He is also responsible for ensuring that all his employees have evacuated the area.  Evacuation drills are performed at the facility at least on an annual basis.  The drill procedures are outlined in the CER.  Prior to the drill, notice is given to the employees, emergency response agencies, and neighbors.  A record of the employees in attendance is maintained along with a record of the results of each drill.  Evacuation and drill procedures are reviewed for new employees upon hire.\n\nAll personnel at U.S. Growers receive emergency response training annually and are directed to medically assist other employees in an emergency situation. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBelow is a summary of the recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study performed on April 14, 1999 at U.S. Growers Cold Storage Areas 5 and 6.\n"
