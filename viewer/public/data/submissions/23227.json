      "SummaryText": "The Schertz/Seguin Local Government Corporation will own and operate a groundwater treatment plant in rural Gonzales County, Texas.  The Corporation is aware of its obligations under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The Corporation notes that there are two obligations that are required of the water treatment plant.\n\n112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause:\nThe substance of the general duty clause is that the Owner/Operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has an obligation to ensure safe operation and to have a plan in the event of an accident.  The Corporation will develop plans to prevent and implement steps to respond to an emergency situation. \n\nRisk Management Plan:\nThe Water Treatment Plant has is aware of the potential hazards posed by the storage and use of chlorine and will establish programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for emergency response in the event of a release.  The purpose of the chlorine in the water treatment process is to treat and disinfect the water.  Chlorine will be delivered as a compressed gas and liquefied gas in one ton cylinders and there will usually be five (5) one ton cylinders at the plant at one time.  For planning purposes, the Water Treatment Plant has considered the impact of a sudden release of 1,500 pounds of chlorine gas within a ten-minute period of time.  This worst-case assumption has a potential radius of impact of 1.9 miles.  The Water Treatment Plant will implement safety procedures to prevent and manage any chlorine releases.  Plant personnel will be trained regularly on proper techniques in handling chlorine, use of safety equipment and safety procedures."
