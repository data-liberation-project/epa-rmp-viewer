The Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government-North Treatment Plant (TPCG-NTP) meets the definition of stationary source. \r\n\r\nA facility is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68) if they handle, manufacture, use or store any of the toxic and/or flammable substances listed in 40 CFR 168.130 above the specified threshold quantities in a process. A review of site operations revealed that two substances stored on site were regulated under Section 68.130, which include chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Seven, each 1-ton cylinder, chlorine tanks and seven, each 1-ton cylinder, sulfur dioxide tanks are stored at the northeast corner of the plant site, next to the sludge press building. The total maximum on-site storage of chlorine is 14,000 pounds, and the total maximum on-site storage of sulfur dioxide is 14,000 pounds. The threshold limits for these substances are 2,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.\r\n\r\n2.0\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis document satisfies the RMP executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and provides the public with a description of the risk management program at TPCG-NTP.\r\n\r\n2.1\tDevelop and Implement a Management System (40 CFR 68.15)\r\n\r\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant Superintendent at TPCG-NTP is responsible for the development and implementation of the risk management program for the facility. \r\n\r\n2.2\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nProgram 2 requires the compilation of up-to-date safety information related to regulated substances, process, and equipment."
