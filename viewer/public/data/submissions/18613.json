      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, CAA 112(r)\nAES Warrior Run\n\n\nThis section is an overview of AES Warrior Run as specified in paragraph 68.155 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112 (r).\n\nAES Warrior Run has developed release prevention programs and emergency response plans and procedures.  (Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan, Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), Title III mandates subtitled the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), and the Occupational Safety and Health's (OSHA) Process Safety Management.\n\nAES Warrior Run is one of several plants owned and operated by the AES Corporation, Arlington, Virginia, whose principal domestic business is the operation of cogeneration plants that produce electricity for sale to industrial energy users and utilities.  The location and construction of the AES Warrior Run facility came about through negotiations between AES and Allegheny Power Systems, Inc.  Allegheny Power Systems, Inc. is a public utility holding company engaged in providing electric service in portions of Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.  A thirty (30) year contract between the parties was executed on January 15, 1988 and later amended defining a commercial operations date of late 1999 for AES Warrior Run.\n\nAES Warrior Run is located south of Cumberland, Maryland in Allegany County.  The facility is situated off of Industrial Boulevard (State Route 51) on Mexico Farms Road, S.E. in a forested area of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The area is sparsely populated and is shared with other industrial concerns.  The entire AES Warrior Run facility is fenced with one entrance to the facility, which is currently, monitored by security on a 24 hour a day seven (7) days a week basis.\n\nDuring the production of electricity, AES Warrior Run uses Anhydrous Ammonia in the facility's selective non-catalytic reduction unit (SNCR) for nitrogen ox"

      "SummaryText": "ide emission control.  Warrior Run stores the Anhydrous Ammonia in a 12,000 gallon tank, when filled to capacity the tank could hold 68,255 pounds of Ammonia.  AES Warrior Run has placed an administrative limit of 9,000 gallons or 51,191 pounds on the tank.\n\nIn the unlikely event the steel tank would rupture (WORST CASE), and cause an instantaneous release, the contents would flow into the surrounding area on the plant site.  The released Ammonia would have the potential to affect a zone with a 1.7 mile radius.  (CAMEO/ALOHA)\n\nAnother unlikely scenario (ALTERNATIVE) would be damage to the tank caused by persons working in the area and being unfamiliar with their surroundings and inadvertently causing damage to the Ammonia Tank.  In this event, the contents (at the 75% administrative limit) would be released into the surrounding area and has the potential to affect an area with a 1.7 mile radius.  The area of concern is the same as for the Worst Case due to the nature of the substance, Ammonia.  (CAMEO/ALOHA)\n\nAES Warrior Run is in compliance with this rule, CAA, Section 112 (r).  In accordance with these plans and procedures, AES performs maintenance inspections, conducts equipment inspections/testing, conducts personnel training on equipment use and safety, equipment failure and emergency response, and ensures security at the facility.\n\nSpecific measures are taken to ensure the accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia does not occur:\n\n1. Maintains/updates procedures for equipment use.\n2. Conducts personnel training.\n3. Ensures Maintenance Procedures are followed.\n4. Maintenance and follow-up records are maintained.\n5. Continues to improve inspections, maintenance and personnel training.\n6. Monitors ammonia deliveries to ensure procedures are followed.\n\nTo ensure personnel and public safety, AES Warrior Run maintains and updates Emergency Response Plans/Procedures."
