Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nWe at Anton Caratan and Son are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nOur facility's primary activities encompass cold storage of table grapes.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Propane and Ammonia (anhydrous).  Propane is used for fueling of company vehicles.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for our cold storage refrigeration.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Propane at our facility is 110880.00 lbs. while Ammonia (anhydrous) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 48500.00 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the new cold storage refrigeration facility.  In this scenario 33500 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 3.37 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the new cold storage refrigeration system.  The scenario involves the release of 33500 lbs. of ammonia.  The ammonia is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 130.76 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of minimizing the quantity released.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.46 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the old cold storage refrigeration system.  The scenario involves the release of 2813 lbs. of ammonia.  The ammonia is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 15 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of minimizing the release by containing the ammonia.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by response by onsite personnel.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.19 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Propane.  In this scenario 110880 lbs. of Propane is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.39"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nAnton Caratan and Son maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined) and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every two years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 02/24/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Anton Caratan and Son maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address "
