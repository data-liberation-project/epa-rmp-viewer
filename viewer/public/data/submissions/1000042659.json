This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas\r\nsuch as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\r\nregulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Although our primary coordination is with the Bradford County (Pennsylvania) LEPC hazardous materials teams, due to our facility's location, which is on the border of New York and Pennsylvania state, we also have provided a copy of this plan to Tioga County (New York) LEPC.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses Cheese and Whey Manufacturing. The plant is located at 400 Leprino Avenue, Waverly, New York. We have one RMP-regulated substance, Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7,\r\nat our facility. which is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese. The maximum inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia at our facility is approximately 42,421 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set\r\nout under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification\r\nrequirements.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by\r\na modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment,\r\noperating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nLeprino Foods Company conducts system and program audits of the Ammonia refrigeration system, PSM, and RMP on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are to be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nLeprino Foods Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
