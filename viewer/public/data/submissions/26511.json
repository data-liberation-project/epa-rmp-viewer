Written operating procedures are used for all processes\n3.   Employees are trained on new or changed processes and equipment\n4.   Contractors are informed of hazards and required to follow plant safety rules\n5.   Safe work practices are used, including lockout/tagout, confined space entry permits, line opening   permits, hot work permits, and contractor work permits\n6.   Process or equipment changes require prior safety review and pre-startup inspection\n7.   Process equipment is inspected, tested and maintained to insure mechanical integrity\n8.

The controls involve process design, equipment installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.\n\nCDC\u00bfs emergency response policy is to maintain an emergency response plan and team capable of responding to and minimizing the effects of any chemical emergency that might occur at the facility.\n\nCDC is a custom batch manufacturer of a wide variety of specialty organic chemicals for use by the agricultural, electronics, coatings and other industries worldwide.  CDC has 11 major buildings located on a 39-acre site.   \n\nCDC has processes containing chlorine and phosphorous oxychloride in excess of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities.  Because of the variable production scheduling inherent in custom batch manufacturing, any or all of these processes may not actually be present on-site at any given time.\n\nIn a worst case scenario accident, all the chlorine contained in a cylinder could be released.  Based on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP*Comp computer program, such an accidental release could extend downwind far enough to affect off-site persons or the environment.\n\nAn alternative chlorine release scenario that would be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario could consist of a leak from a small hole in a chlorine cylinder or its valve.  Based on EPA's RMP*Comp computer program, such a release would not extend downwind far enough to affect off-site persons or the environment.\n\nAn alternative phosphorous oxychloride release scenario that would be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario could consist of a leak from a small hole in the side of a phosphorous oxychloride drum.

The chlorine is stored in DOT-approved steel cylinders.  The cylinders are leak-tested and inspected by the supplier before they are filled.  Respirators are worn by employees while connecting or disconnecting cylinders.  Chlorine cylinder patching and repair kits are readily available on-site.  Employee members of CDC's emergency response team are trained on the use of the kits.  Self-contained breathing apparatus, fully encapsulating suits and portable chlorine detectors are readily available for emergency use by employees responding to a chlorine leak.  Fixed chlorine detectors sound audible alarms and activate interlocks in the event of chlorine leaks.  Chlorine pipelines are constructed of welded steel.  Scrubbers remove any chlorine that vents from the production processes.\n\nA number of precautions and safety measures are employed to prevent occurrence of any phosphorous oxychloride releases. The phosphorous oxychloride drums are banded together three to a pallet so they cannot tip over.  The pallets are stored inside plastic tubs to contain any liquid leaks.  The drums are covered with plastic tarps to keep any liquid leaks inside the plastic tubs.  The building where phosphorous oxychloride is stored is equipped with monitored and pressure-boosted foam sprinklers and is locked when no employees are present.  The drum storage pad where phosphorous oxychloride is also stored is centrally located within the site's perimeter fencing and has overhead cover and a bermed concrete floor.  \n \nThere have been no chlorine or phosphorous oxychloride releases over the last 5 years that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.   \n \nThe fire departments of two municipalities (Fitchburg"

Numerous fire pull stations throughout the site, as well as sprinkler water flow alarms, automatically alert the fire departments.  Numerous portable dry chemical fire extinguishers throughout the site are available for the immediate use of all employees, who are annually provided hands-on fire extinguisher training.  An on-site employee emergency response team is trained and equipped to handle most spills or releases.  An on-site emergency command center is fully equipped with radios and telephones for close cooperation of CDC\u00bfs emergency response team with the fire departments in an emergency.  Four emergency response drills are conducted each year with the fire departments.  Two weather stations are located on-site to provide immediate information on wind speed and direction.  Windsocks installed on several buildings also provide wind direction.  All site supervisors and operators are equipped with portable radios.  A site public address system allows instant communication with most site employees.  A number of CDC managers, including safety and environmental, are always on-call via cellular phones or beepers.  The site\u00bfs gas release siren is audible up to half a mile away.\n\nCDC continually plans changes to improve safety at its site.  Current plans include:\n\n1.
