The tank is isolated within a security fence and located approximately 2000 feet from the Grant Compressor Station (an unmanned facility also owned and operated by Equitable).  The tank is fed by gravity from the chiller system at the compressor station through a 2-inch underground pipeline.  The tank operates at ambient temperature and is designed with relief valves for 250 psig.\nEmergency Plan:\nThe Logan County LEPC is aware of this facility along with the local Cora Volunteer Fire Department.  The Cora Fire Department is the first responder for this facility.  Equitable Resources, Inc. reviewed and updated their emergency response coordination with Logan County LEPC and Cora Fire Department on December 19, 2007."
