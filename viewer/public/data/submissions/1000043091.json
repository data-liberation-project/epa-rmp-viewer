This program requires facilities that have a regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal Risk Management Program (RMProgram) and to register and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).\n\n\n\nThe City of Newnan is subject to this regulation as the owner and operator of the Hershall B. Norred Water Treatment Plant located at 251 Water Works Road\n\nNewnan, (Coweta County), Georgia.  This facility is a stationary source of chlorine (a regulated substance) in excess of 2,500 pounds.\n\n\n\nA RMProgram has been developed to meet the intent of the regulation for this facility using Program 2.  According to the EPA, Program 2 is considered a default program level because any covered process that is not eligible for Program 1 or assigned to Program 3 is, by default, subject to Program 2 requirements, including a streamlined accident prevention program.  Program 1 facilities include processes which would not affect the public in the case of a worst-case release.  Program 3 facilities includes processes which are not eligible for Program 1 and either subject to OSHA's PSM standard under federal or state OSHA programs or classified in one of ten specific industrial classifications (these include higher-risk, complex chemical processing and petroleum refining operations and not a water treatment plant).  However, the state of Georgia doesn't have a delegated OSHA program.  Federal OSHA cannot impose its rules on state or local governments.  State and local governments in non-state-plan states are not subject to any OSHA rules and must comply with Program 2.  Information from the Federal Register, AWWA's Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, and EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68) wer"

Norred Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine in its potable water treatment process to disinfect surface water obtained from raw water reservoirs.  The chlorination process includes the storage of up to four (4) 1-ton cylinders of liquid/gaseous chlorine.  The process is located within a closed building utilizing a vacuum feed system, instrumentation, process specific piping and connection materials.\n\n\n\nA hazard assessment was conducted at the facility to determine the past history of accidents or releases of chlorine.  Plant records and interviews with current plant personnel indicated there have been no releases of chlorine in the last five years that resulted in injury, death or property damage.\n\n\n\nIn compliance with the regulations, a worst-case release scenario was modeled using the EPA RMP*Comp dispersion model to determine the potential impact of such a release. The worst-case scenario assumes that one 1-ton container releases 2,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine over a 10-minute period.  The model predicted that areas within a 1.3 mile radius of the plant could be adversely affected by such a release.  This area includes public receptors such as private residences, schools, churches and places of business.\n\n\n\nAn alternative-case scenario was also modeled using RMP*Comp to model the effects of a more probable release.  This scenario involved a valve failure resulting in the release of gaseous chlorine through a 5/16\" diameter opening over a 60-minute period in a closed building.  This simulation results in the release of 302 pounds of chlorine gas to the atmosphere.  RMP*Comp predicted that areas located within 0.1 mile from the release point could be adversely impacted.  \n\n\n\n1.2    Overview of EPA Risk Management Regulations\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program regulations are intended to prevent and minimize the impacts of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances.

Norred Water Treatment Plant is to maintain public health by providing an adequate supply of safe drinking water, free of disease producing organisms and other health related contaminants.  This process involves the addition of certain chemicals that, if released in an uncontrolled manner, may present a risk to public health.  While such incidents are rare, they have occurred at other similar facilities.  Based on a review of the EPA Accidental Release Information (ARIP) database, over 60 accidental releases of RMP regulated chemicals at water and wastewater treatment facilities in the USA were reported between 1986 and 1995.\n\n\n\nState-of-the-art methods for reducing risks associated with utilizing highly mobile toxic chemicals, such as chlorine, have evolved in recent years.  The newer risk management techniques consist of a comprehensive management system designed to promote responsible and disciplined operation, maintenance, and emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe overall goal in developing and maintaining the Hershall B. Norred Water Treatment Plant RMProgram is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from the accidental release of chlorine liquid or gas.
