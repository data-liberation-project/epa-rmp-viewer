Ten(10) chemicals in the amounts handled by our facility exceed the RMP Threshold Quantity (TQ).  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  The facility manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER Standard.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe facility handles 10 regulated substances subject to RMP regulations (5 toxic and 5 flammables):\n\n[Ethylamine, Cyclohexylamine, Dimethylamine, Formaldehyde (solution), Hydrogen, Methylamine, Propylene Oxide, Trimethylamine, Ethylenediamine, Acrylonitrile]\n\n\n\n The primary purpose of this facility is the manufacture of specialty chemicals.  These specialty chemicals are used by our customers in a variety of application.  Raw materials are received at our plant by rail car, bulk tank truck, drums and pipeline and used as feedstock.  The products are stored in tanks on site and shipped to customers via "
