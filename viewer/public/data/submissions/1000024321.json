Raw materials are received via\r\nrail cars, tank trucks, tote bins, and drums and as a part of  \r\nthe manufacturing processes, the site uses some substances\r\nthat are covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule\r\n(40 CFR 68).  The plant utilizes a combination of good\r\ndesign practices, an accidental release prevention program,\r\nand an emergency response program to ensure the safety of\r\nour employees, the public and the environment.  We are\r\ncommitted to operating our facility in a safe and\r\nresponsible manner.  Following is a brief description of the\r\nfacility and the RMP regulated chemicals at the site.\r\nThe Columbus plant is situated on an 18 acre site.\r\nAdjacent to the plant are an 8 acre property with technical laboratories that\r\nare not currently operational and a 4 acre vacant lot. The site has \r\nfour covered chemicals and is subject to RMP Program Level 3.\r\n\r\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\r\nEPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that companies\r\nprovide information about two types of offsite consequence\r\nanalysis scenarios: worst-case scenarios and alternative\r\nrelease scenarios. There are strict requirements for\r\nchoosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a\r\nresult, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative\r\nand represent a situation that is quite unlikely to occur.\r\nThe purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to\r\nprovide emergency planners with more information about the\r\nchemicals handled at a site and their relative hazards. Alternative \r\nrelease scenarios are generally more realistic than worst-case\r\nscenarios.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL \r\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe Columbus site takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing\r\naccidental releases of chemicals. The site management system\r\naddresses each of the key features of"

Employees are routinely asked to participate in\r\nPHA's, incident investigations, management of change hazard\r\nAnalyses, and all other aspects of the prevention program.\r\nEmployees have access to all information developed as part\r\nof the prevention program and are specifically informed of\r\nany changes that occur in their process areas. The various\r\nways employees are involved in the prevention program are\r\ndocumented in a written plan (ADP-CB-001).\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\r\nThe Columbus plant has established safe work practices\r\nthat ensure the safety of employees.  Examples \r\ninclude (1) hot work permits designed to control\r\nspark or flame producing activities, (2) a permit and\r\nprocedure to control confined space entry, and (3) a\r\nlockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during\r\nmaintenance. These procedures and permits ensure that\r\noperations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\nThe Columbus plant uses contractors for various\r\nactivities such as maintenance and construction.  All\r\ncontractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well\r\ntrained and able to perform their job function in a safe\r\nmanner.  A contractor's safety record and performance are\r\nreviewed during the selection process. Once a contractor is\r\nselected, the plant provides training and procedures to\r\nensure that contractor employees (1) perform their work in a\r\nsafe manner, (2) are aware of the hazards associated with\r\nthe area in which they will be working, (3) understand the\r\nemergency response procedures, and (4) report any hazards\r\nthey find during their work. Site personnel periodically\r\nmonitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing\r\ntheir work in a safe manner.\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\nA compliance audit is performe"

These documents are kept up\r\nto date, are available to all employees, and address\r\nimportant process parameters such as: (1) operating limits\r\nfor the equipment, (2) design basis and configuration of the\r\nequipment and (3) physical properties and hazards associated\r\nwith each chemical.\r\nChemical information is documented within\r\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's). MSDS's contain\r\ninformation concerning both the physical properties and the\r\nhazards associated with each chemical. This information\r\ntypically includes (1) toxicity information, (2) physical\r\ndata, (3) reactivity and corrosivity data, (4) thermal and\r\nchemical stability data and (5) hazards of mixing substances\r\ntogether. MSDS's are available to all employees as well as\r\ncommunity emergency responders.  MSDS's for all\r\nColumbus materials are maintained on site.\r\nImportant process parameters are also documented and\r\nmaintained. Engineering design documents may include (1)\r\noperating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow\r\ndiagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended\r\ninventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping\r\nand instrumentation diagrams and (7) other information that\r\nis important for understanding the design intent, operating\r\nlimits, and hazards of each process.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSES\r\nThe Columbus plant has a comprehensive program for\r\nensuring that the hazards associated with site processes are\r\nidentified and controlled. Each process is examined in\r\ndetail to ensure that hazards are identified and that\r\nappropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is completed as part of \r\nsite process hazard analyses (PHA's).

      "SummaryText": ", operations,\r\nenvironmental and maintenance experience systematically\r\nexamines each section of the process and\r\nidentifies potential causes and a range of possible\r\nconsequences and associated hazards. The team then compares the hazard to the\r\nexisting set of prevention and mitigation measures designed\r\nto contain that hazard, making recommendations for further action when\r\ndeemed necessary. These recommendations are resolved and\r\nprioritized by management and tracked until \r\nimplemented.  Update or revalidation of each PHA for regulated processes is \r\ncompleted every five years or whenever a significant change is made. \r\nThe results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented\r\nand retained.   \r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\nSite engineers, operators and supervisors work together\r\nto develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the\r\nsafe operation of the facility. These procedures cover all\r\nmodes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal\r\noperations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency\r\nshutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a\r\nnew or improved process. Operating procedures are used as a\r\nreference by experienced employees and provide a consistent\r\nbasis for training new employees.  In addition to describing\r\nthe steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures\r\nalso contain valuable information about safe upper and\r\nlower operating limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable\r\nsafety and health information. Operating procedures are\r\ncertified at least every three years as accurate to ensure that they\r\nare updated following process changes.\r\nThe Columbus plant also utilizes a batchsheet\r\nsystem. Batchsheets are the detailed manufacturing procedures\r\nfor making a batch of product.  Batchsheets include\r\nprocess deviation codes describing the actions to take under\r\nvarious conditions (e.g., high temperature, high pressure,\r\nloss of cooling, etc) that may be encountered while\r\nmanufacturing batches containi"

Employees who are new to a\r\nprocess are given basic training that includes (1) a general\r\noverview of the process, (2) the properties of the\r\nsubstances used in the process and their associated hazards,\r\nand (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for\r\nthat process.  Once they have demonstrated their\r\nunderstanding of this initial training, they are paired with\r\nan experienced operator to learn their specific job\r\nfunctions and tasks. After they demonstrate their\r\ncompetence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to\r\nwork independently.\r\nThrough oral reviews, written tests and on-the-job\r\ndemonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the\r\ntraining given to them. Refresher training is performed at\r\na minimum frequency of three (3) years. All training given to an\r\nemployee is documented, along with the means used to verify\r\nthat the training is understood.\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\nThe Columbus plant maintains the mechanical integrity\r\nof our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could\r\nendanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The\r\ninspection and testing program helps identify equipment\r\ndamage or deterioration before the equipment fails. When a\r\ndeficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the\r\nproblem and try to identify the root cause(s) of the\r\ndeficiency so that future problems are avoided. Our quality\r\nassurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment\r\nmeets the strict design standard required for service in our\r\nfacility. The mechanical integrity system includes (1)\r\ninspection and testing procedures, (2) replacement equipment\r\nspecifications, (3) procedures for safe work practices, (4)\r\nmaintenance personnel training and (5) required\r\ndocumentation.\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\nWe review proposed changes to our processes to determine if\r\nnew hazards are introduced or existing prevention measure"
