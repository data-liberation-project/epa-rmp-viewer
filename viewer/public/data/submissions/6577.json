      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSource and Process Description:  Fort Bend County Water Control & Improvement District No. 2 (FBCWCID No.2) owns and operates a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) located at 902 Corine, Stafford, Texas.  According to Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission\u0012s (TNRCC) Design Criteria, FBCWCID No.2 must have 340 lbs. of Chlorine and 255 lbs. of sulfur dioxide in inventory each day.  The influent to a WWTP must go through a series of treatment processes before it is discharged to a stream.  At the very end of these treatment processes are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The chlorine is used to help disinfect the effluent and the sulfur dioxide is used to help strip the excess chlorine from the effluent before being discharged to the stream.  It is unlikely that the WWTP will use this much of either substance in any one day, but because it is necessary to keep this inventory on site, we are submitting this Risk Management Plan.  \n\nSummary of Major Hazards: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) does not consider  chlorine or sulfur dioxide to be carcinogenic.  Depending on how much of either of these two chemicals is inhaled, effects could range from as little as a slight irritation to the eyes, skin, or lungs to possibly inhaling a large enough dose to prove fatal.  If a vapor cloud of either of these two chemicals is suspected, it is recommended that you immediately go indoors (do not try to outrun the cloud as you may run directly into it), turn off the air conditioning system, and stuff wet towels under all cracks in the doors and windows and the like.  Wait for an all-clear before returning outside.\n\nConsequences of Failure to Control the Hazards:  It is necessary to perform a worst case and alternative case scenario for both of these chemicals in order to submit a Risk Management Plan.  For the worst case scenario, it is assumed that a one (1) ton cylinder has a leak such that it\u0012s duration lasts for ten (10) minutes.  A one (1)"

      "SummaryText": "ton cylinder (2,000 lbs.) will have a release rate of 200 lbs. per minute for ten (10) minutes.  This is actually a bit excessive due to the tendencies of the chemical to freeze as the pressure drops so rapidly.  This is true for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provided equations and tables specifically for the RMP to figure the toxic endpoint of both chemicals.  The toxic endpoint is simply the distance at which a human is not at risk from possible inhalation of the chemical.  The toxic endpoints for chlorine and sulfur dioxide for a worst case scenario are 3.0 and 3.1 miles, respectively.  As mentioned, an alternative case scenario is also required.  This scenario assumes that a one (1) ton cylinder has been punctured and consequently had a =\" hole in it.  Once again, EPA provided tables and equations for this scenario.  The toxic endpoints for chlorine and sulfur dioxide for this scenario are 0.3 and 0.2 miles, respectively.  \n\nExplanation of How Releases are Prevented:  Preventing a release is of the utmost importance to our operators and neighbors!  We are confident in our emergency response plan, but would prefer not using it by simply practicing good preventive maintenance.  The operators at the plant have daily log-in duties, one of which is to check for gas leaks by both visual inspection and by use of ammonia.  In the case that a leak is seen or detected, the operators have spare parts on hand for minor repairs, and a self contained breathing apparatus.  A chlorinator repair company is under contract to handle all repairs other than minor.  \n\nSteps Taken to Address Hazards:  As mentioned, a chlorinator maintenance company is under contact to perform biannual checks of the chlorinator systems and ensure any needed repairs are made.  Employees have also taken courses offered by TEEX on chlorine safety and maintenance. FBCWCID No.2 has a one (1) ton cylinder repair kit on site, and our operators have been instruct"

      "SummaryText": "ed by DXI (a mature, knowledgeable chlorine supply company) on how to use the kit.  \n\n\n\nResponse Action in Event of a Release:  The Stafford Fire Department will be notified either by the operator or the auto-dialer should a release occur.  An auto dialer is a safety device that, as the name implies, automatically dials a programmed telephone number should an emergency occur.  The auto dialer is hooked directly to a gas detector which is constantly trying to detect gas.  The detector will send a signal to the auto dialer if it detects gas and this prompts it to start dialing.  The employees of the facility will leave as soon as the fire department has been notified as they will not respond to a major emergency.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan:  An emergency response plan has been written specifically for FBCWCID No.2 treatment plant.  A copy of the plan will be distributed to Mamie George County Library at 320 Dulles Avenue."
