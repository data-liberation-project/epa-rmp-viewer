This document has been prepared to consider the propane terminal as a single RMP Program Level 3 process.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nEl Dorado Logistics LLC has a dedicated commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance activities . The goal is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, terminal personnel have been trained on the proper response to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nHollyFrontier Corporation established the propane terminal under a master limited partnership, El Dorado Logistics LLC, a subsidiary of  Holly Energy Partners (HEP), which owns and operates the terminal. The propane terminal is located at in 1651 S. Haverhill Rd, El Dorado, Kansas and receives propane via pipeline from the HollyFrontier El Dorado Refining LLC's (HFEDR's) refinery, located adjacent to the terminal. Propane is the only RMP regulated substance above its threshold quantity in the terminal.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE/CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\nThe propane terminal is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Therefore, there is a management system in place to address each element and to implement the accident prevention program. A brief discussion follows for each of these areas. Employee participation is encouraged in the development, review and application of procedures and information regarding the various PSM and RMP elements. Some of the more significant opportunities for active participation are Process Hazard A"

The information regarding chemicals and equipment is extensive and is continuously being verified and updated.\r\n\r\nIdentifying potential hazards is a critical element of the safety process at the  terminal. Process Hazard Analysis study has been performed on the propane terminal and is revalidated on a 5 year schedule. Hazard analysis is also performed on changes through the Management of Change process. Recommendations resulting from the studies are addressed and actions taken to address the recommendations are documented.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures have been developed to provide instructions for safely operating the  terminal. These procedures serve as a consistent basis for training new operators and for reference by experienced operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed, are considered in the management of change process and are annually certified as current and accurate.\r\n\r\nOperator Training is conducted in coordination with the operating procedures. New employees receive foundational and task specific training on terminal operation. All operators receive refresher training to ensure operating skills and knowledge are maintained and enhanced. Training requirements are also considered when changes are made to the process.\r\n\r\nThe terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce and because this work is often on or near process equipment, there are specific requirements for contractors. Contractor safety programs, performance and training are evaluated prior to allowing them to perform work in the terminal. The contractors are made aware of terminal safety rules and evacuation plans and are informed of potential hazards related to their work. Contractor activities are moni"

The review and authorization process makes provisions for reviewing the change from several aspects, including the potential hazards, safety and health effects, procedural updates and training requirements. The pre-startup safety review provides a final safety review of the change prior to startup.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity programs are necessary to provide for the on-going integrity of process equipment and instrumentation. Experienced employees and qualified contractors perform maintenance work on the equipment and instrumentation. Inspection and tests are performed in accordance with facility and industry standards and quality assurance is incorporated in new construction and maintenance activities.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigations are valuable learning tools in determining facts regarding incidents and in developing corrective actions to prevent recurrence. The terminal has personnel resources trained in incident investigation techniques and they are assigned as required to form teams, investigate incidents and report on the findings. The report and any recommendations are then acted on to improve the safety of the terminal and the refinery.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices at the HFEDR refinery are long-standing practices to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. These are periodically reviewed and updated.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, audits are periodically conducted to confirm the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
