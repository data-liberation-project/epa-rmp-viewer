Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe frozen vegetables facility located in Waseca, Minnesota is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration system.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we have trained staff in emergency response and are coordinated with the Waseca Fire Department and the Waseca County LEPC for emergency response support.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThis facility processing plant used for food manufacturing and packaging of vegetable products (i.e., peas & corn).  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia utilized as the primary cooling media in our two (2) closed-looped ammonia refrigeration systems.  In that the engine rooms are in close proximity and managed by onsite personnel as one system (PSM Program), for the purposes of this RMP we are considering both systems as one process.  \r\n\r\nDue to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration onsite, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability (>10,000 lbs.), this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n \r\n3.
