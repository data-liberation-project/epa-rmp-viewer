      "SummaryText": "The Motiva Enterprises, LLC - Bainbridge Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association #58 (2004 Edition) for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage, and it is this Facility's policy to notify the Bainbridge Fire Department (Stations 1 & 2) and Decatur County LEPC via the \"911\" service in the event of an emergency and follow all additional response procedures set forth in the Facility's Integrated Contingency Plan, as appropriate.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Bainbridge Memorial Hospital and associated ambulance service via 911.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire and hazardous material emergency response team (first responder - operations) to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  The Motiva Enterprises, LLC - Bainbridge Terminal transfers/stores refined product (regular/premium gasoline and diesel fuel) and handles product additives, including the liquified butane blending system (direct injection into refined product pipelines).  The Risk Management Program covers the butane blending system including the associated piping, 2 x 84,000 gallon vessels, the blending skid, sampling unit (Grabner), and the truck offloading station product connection points.    The Facility's worst case scenario is the catastrophic failure of the blending system's manifolded 84,000 gallon liquified (pressure) butane vessels when filled to the greatest amount allowed (fill shutoff device at 85% with an alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This is the recommended scenario based on the EPA Guidance Document and RMP Comp.  The facility's alternate scenario (most likely scenario resulting in a substantive release based on discussion with Texon and terminal personnel) is a BLEVE due to radiant heat.  Other alternatives considered included pump failure and liquid butane pipe failure.  These scenarios were either considered highly unlikely or resulted in less of an impact.\n  \nThe Motiva Enterprises LL"

      "SummaryText": "C - Bainbridge Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Part 1910.119).  The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained to meet or exceed the NFPA #58 requirements for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage.  To this date, this Facility has never had an accident involving the butane blending system (new process) resulting in dealths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in-place.  In the event of an emergency involving the Bainbridge Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Bainbridge Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and hazardous substance emergency response team, as referenced above.  The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Bainbridge Fire Department and the Decatur County LEPC.  The Bainbridge Fire Department, which maintains a full hazardous material response team, is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, access via East Shotwell Street or Pipeline Road, and available fire suppression equipment including approximately eighteen 20lb. ABC fire extinguishers, and water sources (three hydrants available adjacent to the Terminal with a total flow of approximately 2,300 gpm).  Motiva Enterprises, LLC Bainbridge Terminal maintains a vegetation control program to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the system.\n\nMotiva Enterprises, LLC - Bainbridge is continually seeking opportunities to improve the safety of the process.  Currently, Motiva is evaluating protective equipment requirements during line breaking activities and developing a flaring procedure."
