The chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are used in the order received and are stored separately from the empty containers.  Each cylinder is checked with aqueous ammonia as it comes off the truck to insure there are no leaks before the delivery is accepted.\n \nThe maximum inventory of chlorine stored in one- ton cylinders and connected at the unloading station into the system at one time is 4000 lbs. Only one cylinder (2,000 lbs) is being utilized at any given time. The maximum inventory of sulfur dioxide and chlorine in one-ton cylinders including storage is 8,000 lbs for each.\n\nDeviations from the normal procedures involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide could easily cause the malfunction or destruction of equipment, Injury or loss of life.  Further a catastrophic release of gas would cause the evacuation of nearby residents and could affect the water quality of downstream users if the disinfection process were to be interrupted. \n\nProcedures are in place for connecting, changing and valving one ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders into the process.\n\nIn the event of the sulfur dioxide pump malfunction there is in place a water feed system that will disburse the sulfur dioxide to the effluent water in a liquid suspension rather than direct injection by gas.  To initiate this procedure the sulfur pump is removed and the valve is changed to facilitate the flow of gas through a pipe supply system. The water feed system is turned on to produce a vacuum for the system. The gas feeds from the tank as normal. There are no temporary conditions required for the chlorine system.  Each part of the system can be isolated and rerouted so that part of the system can be worked on while as a whole the process continues to operate. Should repairs not allow for this the system must be shut down and Emergency Procedures are in place.\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary o"

It is heavier than air and extremely toxic with 8 hour exposure limits of 1PPM. It has a strong pungent smell that serves as a warning of its presence. Chlorine is an extremely strong oxidizing agent and is commonly used as a disinfectant in potable water and waste water systems.\nChlorine is toxic by inhalation, ingestion and through skin contact. Inhalation can cause serious lung damage and may be fatal.\nThe DOT classifies chlorine as a corrosive and toxic material.\n\nSulfur Dioxide\n\nSulfur dioxide (SO2) at ambient temperature and pressure is a colorless gas. Each molecule of sulfur dioxide contains 1 atom of sulfur and 2 atoms of oxygen. It is heavier than air and extremely toxic with 8 hour exposure limits of 2 PPM. It has a strong pungent smell that serves as a warning of its presence. Sulfur dioxide is a bi product from ore smelting and is an interim product in the production of sulfuric acid. It is also used in waste water treatment and potable water treatment to control residual chlorine levels.  Sulfur dioxide is corrosive when wet.\nThe DOT classifies sulfur dioxide as toxic.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe two worst case scenarios for the City of Ashland Waste Treatment Facility involve a rupture of either a Chlorine Cylinder or a Sulfur Dioxide cylinder resulting in a total loss of the contents over a ten minute period.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe City of Ashland Waste Treatment Operation is committed to providing the optimum in employee and public safety and health. It is our policy that each employee has a safe healthful place in which to work. It is also the policy of the City of Ashland to expect each employee to live up to the responsibility of following all safety rules and committing to safety. The City of Ashland will coordinate adequate emergency response capabilities to handle any on site emergency regarding RMP-covered chemicals. The City of Ashland executes this policy through employee training, education, coordination and drills with local emergency response agencies.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe basic concept of disinfection of waste streams with chlorine depends on its solution in water. Dissolving chlorine in water rapidly forms a mixture of hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid which is a pH dependent reaction. Dissociation of hypochlorous acid increases as pH increases from 6.0 to 8.5.  Chlorine exists predominantly as hypochlorous acid. Chlorine existing in the forms of hypochlorous acid and the hypochlorite ion is defined as \u00bffree chlorine.\u00bf Chlorine may react with certain components in the wastewater to impair its efficiency as a disinfectant.  Dechlorination is achieved through the use of sulfur dioxide gas which, when dissolved in water forms sulfurous acid, a strong reducing agent.  Chemically, sulfur dioxide, when added to chlorinated water, reduces all forms of free chlorine to chloride and is converted itself   in to sulfate. Both chlorides and sulfates occur naturally in most waters.  Sulfonation removes free and combined residuals with equal efficiency.\n\nThe chlorinators original flow control was proportional. They are now manually adjusted by using the total chlorine results in conjunction with the fecal coliform results supplied by the lab.  The chlorine system is able to feed 360 lbs. per day which is seven times higher than our normal feed rate of around"
