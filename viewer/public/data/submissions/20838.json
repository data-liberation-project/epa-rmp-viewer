The greatest amount held in a single vessel or\n2. The greatest amount in a pipe.  \n\nFor the refrigeration system at the J.R. Simplot Grand Forks facility the worst-case release is that of a high-pressure receiver (maximum amount held in a single vessel) ruptures and its contents escape to the building in 10 minutes.  According to EPA's guidance in the case of a vessel, the quantity does not include any liquid ammonia in pipework connected to the vessel and in any other vessel that can discharge directly into pipework connected to the vessel.  However, the maximum amount of ammonia that could be in the vessel at any one time, not just during normal operation is required to be considered.  The facility has two high-pressure receivers with capacities of 14,500 pounds of ammonia each.  Piping connects the receivers; however, per the EPA guidance only one of the vessels needs to be considered for purposes of determining the worst-case release quantity.\n\nIn the event the high-pressure receiver would release its entire contents to the building in 10 minutes the release rate quantity would be 14,500 pounds which is equal to the maximum amount held in any single vessel at the facility.  The rule allows the consideration of passive mitigation when estimating the worst-case release rate.  Since the receiver is indoors and not directly adjacent to a door or window that may be open, the building provides some attenuation in the event of a release.  The room structure facilitates the condensation of ammonia causing a rain-out effect.  Only a portion of the total ammoni"

EPA detailed a methodology for estimating a mitigated release rate in their guidance document entitled EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The methodology is presented below:\n\nTo estimate the mitigated release rate, assume the following:\n\n1.  The amount of material airborne in the building four-tenths of the total inventory, or 0.4Q\n2. The airborne material includes 0.2Q vapor and 0.2 Q liquid droplets.\n\nAn attenuation factor for the worst case release scenario was taken from Exhibit 4-3 of the EPA guidance document Ten-minute Building Release Attenuation Factors for Prolonged Releases.  \n\nEstimate o as follows:\n1.  Determine room volume, V, in cubic feet\n2.  Calculate o from room volume divided by the quantity of ammonia initially released as vapor, or \no (ft3/lb) = V/(0.2Q)\n3.  Determine the active ventilation rate, Nv, in room volumes exchanged per hour (hr-1), for the building.\n4.  From Exhibit 4-3, find the 10-minute building attenuation factor, FR10, corresponding to your estimated o and the ventilation rate, Nv.\n5.  Estimate the release rate in lbs/min from the building attenuation factor and the airborne quantity (0.4Q) as follows, assuming the release takes place over 10 minutes:\n\nQRB = (FR10 x 0.4Q)/10\n\nHigh-pressure receiver contains 14,500 lbs of ammonia\nRoom size = 180,600 ft3\n\nHence: o = 180,600/(0.2 x 14,500) = 62 ft3/lb\nNearest o on Exhibit 4-3 = 50 ft3/lb\nVentilation rate = 44 room volumes/hour  (131,310 ft3/min)\nNearest Nv on Exhibit 4-3 = 40 room volumes/hour\n\nTherefore:\no = 50\nNv = 40\nFR10 = 0.85 (from Exhibit 4-3)\n\n\nQRB = (0.85)(0.4)(14,500)/10 = 493 lb/min\n\nThe estimated worst-case release rate is then used to determine the distance to the toxic end-point.

The alternative release scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\n\nThe scenario for the alternative release follows:\n\nA process line refrigeration system is put into defrost mode.  An automatic valve fails to open causing pressure to build in the low-pressure receiver.  The pressure in the low-pressure receiver causes the relief valve to open releasing ammonia to the atmosphere.  It is estimated that it would take 10 minutes for the ammonia to be detected and the operator on shift to manually open the valve that failed to open automatically.  This scenario would result in 45 pounds of ammonia being emitted to the atmosphere prior to the valve being opened.  An ammonia release rate of 45 pounds in 10-minutes results in a release rate of 4.5 pounds per minute.  Based on"

EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  This method was developed by EPA to ensure a common basis for comparison even though the EPA recognizes that the methodology uses assumptions that are not realistic and in some cases not physically possible.  The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or more likely.  Active mitigation measures can be used in determining the alternative release scenario while the worst-case scenario is only allowed consideration of passive mitigation measures.\n \nThe toxic endpoint for ammonia has been defined by EPA to be 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm).  This airborne concentration that is used as the toxic endpoint is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects. \n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint becomes a radius for a circle around the process containing the regulated substance.  Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information.  The population number is reported as part of the EPA submittal.  This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a single ammonia release, because the ammonia plume would seek lowest elevations in the direction of the wind during a release.

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nJ.R. Simplot Company's Grand Forks facility is part of the Simplot Food Group.  The Grand Forks facility processes raw potatoes into frozen french fries and other frozen potato products.  The Simplot Food Group turns out two billion pounds of frozen french fries and other frozen potato products per year at five facilities in the U.S.  The frozen potato products are predominantly for the food service industry.  Potato processing requires raw potatoes to be cleaned, peeled, cut to size, blanched, dried, fried, frozen, packaged and then placed in frozen storage.  The cooling system uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations 40 CFR Part 68, require facilities that have regulated substances above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal Risk Management Program.  EPA also requires these facilities to register and submit a Risk Management Plan to EPA using RMP*Submit\u00e4  by June 21, 1999.  The J.R. Simplot Grand Forks plant maintains quantities of anhydrous ammonia above the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and as such is subject to the requirements of Program 3 in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe elements of the RMP are listed below:\n\n\u00d8 Hazard Assessment - Assess the potential impacts of worst-case and alternative release scenarios and compile a 5-year accident history.\n\n\u00d8 Prevention Program - Implement a comprehensive management program that affects a wide variety of operation, training, and maintenance activities.

Simplot company has operated the Grand Forks facility since 1981; however, the plant has been in operation since the late 1950's.  The cooling system at the Grand Forks facility was remodeled in 1986.  The safety features of the system continue to be re-evaluated and improved.  The facility is currently supplementing its existing ammonia leak detection system with additional detection probes that will be integrated into the plant's computer operating system.  This will allow the monitoring of the ammonia leak detectors on a plant wide basis. The facility has had a  successful operating record.  \n\nThe safe operation of the Grand Forks facility is further illustrated by the recognition the facility received from the U.S. Department of Labor.  \n\nU.S. Department of Labor, Certificate in recognition of outstanding contributions to the programs and objectives of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, December 28, 1998. \n\n68.155(b) Stationary Source and the Substance Handled\nPotato processing requires raw potatoes to be cleaned, peeled, cut to size, blanched, dried, fried, frozen, packaged and then placed in frozen storage.
