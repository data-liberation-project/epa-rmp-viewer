      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Chlorine\n\nThe Patapsco Wastewater Treatment Plant has the ability to store one ton chlorine containers both inside and outside of the chlorine facilities. It is equipped to store a maximum of 24 one-ton chlorine containers, twelve of which are stored within the building and are connected to the chlorination system, and twelve of which are stored outdoors.\n\nSix chlorine containers sit atop a series of three hydraulic load scales while six are stored on floor level trunnions. Each scale weighs a pair of chlorine containers and is connected to one wall mounted scale dial. The scale dial provides a localized readout and enables the Operator to continuously monitor the available chlorine remaining in the containers.\n \t\nThe chlorination system is designed to allow to manifold twelve, one ton chlorine containers at a time, which are ready for service (connected). The twelve containers are manifolded using a yoke adapter, a container isolation valve and a flexible line leading to. a header valve. The chlorine supply can thus be isolated using either the container isolation valve at the header valve. Plan and flow diagrams of the chlorine system are included as Exhibit 4 in the Appendix.\n\nFrom each of the manifolded containers, liquid chlorine is supplied under pressure into one evaporator.  Four liquid line pressure reliefs are installed between the manifolded containers and the evaporators to prevent any over pressurization condition.\n\nFour 10,000 lb./day evaporators convert the liquid elemental chlorine into chlorine gas by using a hot water bath heat exchanger for vaporization. The evaporators include an automatic water level control system; a gas pressure relief system; high pressure, low temperature and low level water bath alarms for operational safety.

Four cylinders are connected to the dechlorination system at any one time, while thirteen remain in the storage area. An overhead monorail system equipped with an electric hoist is available to transport the ton containers from the storage trunnions or cradles to the scale trunnions and vice-versa. The monorail system also has the ability to transport the containers to or from the loading/unloading area to the storage areas of the Dechlorination Building.\n\nFour sulfur dioxide containers sit atop a series of two hydraulic load scales while thirteen (twelve full, one empty) are stored on floor level trunnions. Each scale weighs a pair of sulfur dioxide containers and is connected to two wall mounted scale dials. The scale dials provide a localized readou"

The four containers are manifolded using a yoke adapter, a container isolation valve and a flexible line leading to a header valve. Thus the sulfur dioxide supply can be isolated using either the container isolation valve or the header valve. \n\nFrom each of the manifolded containers, liquid sulfur dioxide is supplied under pressure into evaporators located in the SO2 Feeder Room. Two liquid line pressure relief valves are installed between the manifolded containers and the evaporators to prevent any over pressurization condition.
