              "Description": "The ammonia refrigeration system at the Valley Sweet facility is an integral part of the overall business.  It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.                                                                                                                                                                                             Our refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, Ross Christopher, who also assists us in performing preventative maintenance and reviews of our system/process equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                    We inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in a tailgate safety meeting.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.                                                                                                                                                                                       Our ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigation engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 \"Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating System.\"  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction.                                                                                                                                                                                Our ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with safety relief valves.  These valves limit the operating pressures of the entire system, and prevent failures due to everpressurization.  In the event of a valve lift, ammonia would not be released to the atmosphere because the relief valves are plumbed to a common header pipe which transfers the vapor into a water diffusion tank.",

Therefore, for the purposes of auditing and regulatory review, the following table is provided to provide concordant information regarding the program and the required regulatory elements.\n\n1.  THE VALLEY SWEET RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Valley Sweet has prepared a unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements.  At the Federal level, Title 40 CFR Part 68), and California OSHA's \"Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials,\" and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program is being prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system.\n\nOur program will promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  The program will enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one of which we are quite proud.  Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  The Risk Management Plan unifies our efforts, and sets forth rules, procedures and practices which will help our employees protect themselves and our neigh"

DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nThe Valley Sweet facility is a commercial packinghouse for deciduous tree fruit - apples, apricots, nectarines, peaches, plums, grapes, persimmons and kiwi fruit.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  Two rooms are designated as \"precooling\" rooms, three are designated as \"cold storage\" rooms and ten others are designated as \"controlled atmosphere\" (C.A.) rooms.  The precool and storage rooms are equipped with \"bunker style\" evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  The C.A. Rooms are equipped with \"ceiling suspended\" evaporator units.  There is a hydrocooler as well.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a series of a liquid feed solenoid valves.  From there, high pressure liquid is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls or in the ceiling units in the rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the primary accumulator vessel located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receiver.  Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into a liquid transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel t"

It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction.  The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\nThere is only one ammonia system at our facility.  Therefore, we are treating our facility as a single process.\n\n3.  AMMONIA RELEASE SCENARIOS\n3.1  Worst Case Scenario\nAt Valley Sweet, our worst case scenario is a failure of our high-pressure receiver containing 25,000 lbs. of ammonia.  Following the instructions set forth in EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68),\" we considered the failure of one vessel.  We did not include any liquid ammonia in pipework connected to the failed vessel or in any other vessel that could discharge directly into the pipework connected to the failed vessel.  Under this scenario, the release would be passively mitigated by the fact that the primary receiver vessel is inside a housing.  The ammonia would be released over a ten-minute period.\n\nUsing RMP*Comp we estimate that the ammonia would travel 2.2 miles (rural conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  The potentially affected area can be found on a site map in Appendix A.\n\n\n4.

It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, Ross Christopher, who also assists us in performing an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment.\n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in a tailgate safety meeting.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 \"Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\"  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with safety relief valves.  These valves limit the operating pressures of the entire system, and prevent failures due to overpressurization.  In the event of a valve lift, ammonia would not be released to the atmosphere because the relief valves are plumbed to a common header pipe which transfers the vapor into a water diffusion tank.\n\n5.

      "SummaryText": "ent investigation made it clear that the release was initiated by human error.  A maintenance worker left a cover inside the electrical housing for a fan.  When the fan was turned on, the cover blew out of the housing and sliced through an evaporator coil.  There were no offsite consequences.  Onsite, one Valley Sweet employee complained of temporary breathing difficulty.  He was examined at the hospital with eight other employees who worked in relatively close proximity to the punctured coil. Of the nine employees examined, all were released from the hospital, but the one employee mentioned earlier elected to stay at home for 2 days.  In addition, the accident caused an estimated $40,000 of damage to our product.  Since the time of the accident, we have revised our training and maintenance procedures to decrease the likelihood of human error, and modified our emergency response plan to ensure a more rapid and efficient repsonse.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \"Emergency Action Plans.\"  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\" and Title 29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStrategically, we will respond defensively to a release.  Under this plan our ammonia refrigeration personnel will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control.  The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipiment.  To better prepare for this type of action, initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the HAZWOPER regulations will take place within the next year.  All response activities will be done in coordination with the local fire department and the Visalia Fire Department H"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one of which we are quite proud.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Valley Sweet continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nOne change has been to group the plan elements to align with Valley Sweet's business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Safe Operating Procedures are now grouped together for the benefit of our system operators.  Safe Operating Policies are now grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.\n\nA second change has been to ensure that plan documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety are merged together to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Forms in the plan that are not being used will be discarded and replaced with more relevant documents.  Alternatively, forms that are being used at Valley Sweet that meet plan documentation requirements, but which weren't acknowledged by the plan are now included.\n\nA third change is that operators have assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures for ease of use.  In addition, there is now a method for receiving operator feedback and making changes in the future.\n\nThe last, but perhaps most fundamental change, is that the Risk & Process Safety Management Program is now thought of as a \"living document\".  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Valley Sweet employees.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Valley Sweet will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant,"
