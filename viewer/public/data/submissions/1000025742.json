Save A Lot operates many retail grocery stores throughout the states of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana and Tennessee that are supplied through Save A lot's distribution center located in Winchester, KY. Save A Lot's Winchester, KY Distribution Center employs approximately 220 and utilizes anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of perishable grocery products in storage.  Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA Regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\r\n\r\nPursuant to RMP Regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulations Save A Lot has developed a comprehensive RMP/PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals (anhydrous ammonia) located on site. The facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What-If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using operations staff at the facility and the contractor retained by Save A  Lot to operate and maintain the refrigeration system as well as an experienced facilitator (engineer) from SuperValu Inc. \r\n\r\nSave A lot's implementation of the RMP/PSM Program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The Plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nSave A Lot is"
