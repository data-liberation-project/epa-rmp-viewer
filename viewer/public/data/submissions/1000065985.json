Due to the quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the system it is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety. \n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Tillamook County Creamery Association to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Our commitment to safety is apparent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is our Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and response coordination with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively respond to unplanned events.  \n\n\n\n1.20    Facility Description and Substances Handled\n\n\n\n?    Tillamook County Creamery Association manufacturing facility processes, stores, and distributes dairy products, such as cheese and ice-cream.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n\n\n?    The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n?    There are two separate refrigeration systems "

There is also a cheese starter system that requires up to 2,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\n1.30    The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView V (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n\n\n1.40    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nTillamook County Creamery Association complies with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility is in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\n\n\nTillamook County Creamery Association's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Tillamook County Creamery Association Director of Engineering.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee "

This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a defined course of action to effectively respond to unplanned events.  This plan has been reviewed with the Tillamook Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur and establish procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has a system in place to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n\n\n?    Incident Command Center\n\n?    Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n\n?    Hazmat Emergency Response Team\n\n?    Evacuation Plans, and Assembly Points\n\n?
