      "SummaryText": "A general overview of the City prevention and response policies regarding chlorine gas release is summarized below: \n\n\n\nUpon detection of a chlorine gas release at a concentration of 2 ppm or higher, the following occurs:\n\n?    Interior and exterior audible alarms activate throughout facility.\n\n?    Interior and exterior visual alarms activate (e.g., amber beacon on side of building, indicator lights on interior alarm panel).\n\n?    The fire alarm notifier/dialer activates (emergency responders).\n\n?    The operator alarm notifier/dialer activates (on call operator).\n\n?    The chlorine gas scrubber automatically activates.\n\n?    Any operations staff that are onsite will evacuate to the Rally Point (outside the front entry gate).\n\n?    The Glenwood Springs Police and Fire departments are immediately dispatched to the water treatment plant.\n\n\n\nOnce Emergency Responders and RMWTP operations staff congregate at the rally point, a response plan will be collectively developed.  As a general policy, an uncontrolled release will be allowed to continue until the leaking container is emptied (under close supervision of first responders) as long as the released chlorine gas is actively removed by the chlorine gas scrubber.  If the chlorine gas leak cannot be not mitigated by the chlorine scrubber, the Incident Commander and Emergency Responders will begin community notifications/evaluations and determine if corrective action will be taken to mitigate the leak.    \n\n\n\nControllable releases may be repaired by RMWTP operators (with support by Fire Department staff) if the repair work is deemed safe by the Incident Commander.  The following criteria are used to determine the appropriate response actions:\n\n\n\n?    If the chlorine level in the storage area is not detectable on the chlorine sensor, operations staff may be allowed entry to the chlorine storage area to make repairs.  Emergency \n\nresponders will serve as attendants during the repair or until the area is determined safe to work in by the Incident "

If the chlorine level in the storage area is detected on the chlorine sensor, but is less than 2.0 ppm:,  operations staff may be allowed to enter the chlorine storage area to make repairs but only if donning an SCBA.   Emergency responders will serve as attendants during the entry.\n\n?    If the chlorine level in the storage area is detected on the chlorine sensor and is above 2.0 ppm, operators are not allowed to enter the storage room until levels fall below 2.0 ppm.  \n\n\n\n2.2    Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nChlorine Gas\n\n?    1-ton containers (maximum storage capacity of 4 containers)\n\n?    Maximum of 2 containers hooked up at any time\n\n\n\n2.3    Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n\n?    Gas Release (e.g. failed fusible plug)\n\n?    2,000 lbs released over 10 minutes.  \n\n?    Distance to toxic endpoint: 0.9 miles.\n\n?    Population within distance to endpoint: 2,176.\n\n?    Passive mitigation - Release in enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\n?    Leak at Container Isolation Valve (e.g., packing nut problem)\n\n?    600 lbs released over 60 minute duration.\n\n?    Distance to toxic endpoint: 0.1 miles.\n\n?    Population within distance to endpoint: 0.\n\n?    Passive mitigation - Release in enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air.\n\n\n\n2.4    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nAccidental releases are prevented at the RMWTP by a combination of mechanical safety equipment, alarming systems, operator training programs, standardized operating procedures, preventative maintenance, and routine safety review audits.  The individual programs are summarized within the facility's RMP in the following sections:\n\n?    Hazard Reviews (Section 8.0)\n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures (Section 9.0)\n\n?    Training (Section 10.0)\n\n?    Maintenance (Section 11.0)\n\n?    Compliance Audits (Section 12.0)\n\n?

In general, the operation staff's response to any uncontrolled chlorine release is to immediately alert emergency First Responders and to evacuate the site.  RMWTP operators are trained in the safe use of SCBA and personal protective equipment, but mitigation of an uncontrolled chlorine gas leak will be deferred to the City of Glenwood Springs Fire Department.  RMWTP operators may respond to a controllable chlorine gas leak only if there is more than one trained operator on site and emergency responders are notified of the corrective work.   \n\n\n\n2.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe City of Glenwood Springs plans to eliminate the gaseous chlorine feed system in the near-term.  It will be replaced with an on-site sodium hypochlorite feed system.  Design of the sodium hypochlorite feed system is anticipated to begin in late-2018.  Construction is anticipated for late- 2019 or early-2020.\n\n"
