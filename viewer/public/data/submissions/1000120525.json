Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility. This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nThis is the initial EPA registration for this Satellite Facility.  The RMP Program for the Satellite Facility has been prepared.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThis Satellite Facility serves as a place for temporary storage of (16) 1,450-gallon nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia (full or residual).  Nurse Tanks, located and filled at the Main Facility, are transported to this Satellite Facility for temporary storage prior to retail sale.  When sold, the nurse tank(s) are transported to the customer farm for application.  After application, the nurse tank(s) are transported back to the Satellite location for temporary storage until returned to the Main Facility for refill.  Trained Facility personnel transport nurse tanks and manage the nurse tank pressure vessels in accordance with the RMP Operating Procedures.  There is no maintenance or transfer of anhydrous ammonia operations at this Satellite Facility.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.

The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Facility will address each recommendation listed in the process hazard analysis (PHA). In summary, the PHA recommendations include, but are not limited to:\n\u0095\tPerform emergency coordination and notification with response agencies.\n\u0095\tUpdate the Facility RMP program to reflect the EPA RMP rule changes published on May 2024.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by the Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Facility adds, deletes, or makes changes to the process.\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Facility."
