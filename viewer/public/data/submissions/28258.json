The RMP established three levels of requirements \nfor the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the \nenvironment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed \nfor \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most\nstringent of the three levels.\n\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n\n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n       North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n       Five-year accident history\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \n\nThis facility is regulated under Program 2 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n\n       It handles acrylonitrile and cyclohexylamine in excess of the threshold quantities\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public Receptor\n       (residence)\n       It does not operate under a NAICS code specified in the rule\n       It is not subject to OSHA PSM because PSM does not apply to flammable \n       liquids stored in atmospheric tanks which are kept below their normal \n       boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration \n       [29 CFR 1926.64(a)(1)(ii)(B)].).\n\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has\nmore than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under\n40 CFR 68.115.  Stolthaven New Orleans, LLC (Stolthaven New Orleans) is a bulk chemical \nstorage and transfer facility that handles more than the threshold quantities of both \nacrylonitrile (20,000 pounds) and cyclohexylamine (15,000 pounds).\n\nStolthaven New Orleans, LLC is committed to operating in a safe and compliant "

Process safety and emergency response materials are kept on site and periodically \nreviewed.  Training includes the review of information pertaining to the hazards of acrylonitrile\nand cyclohexylamine, process technology, process equipment, and emergency response procedures.\n\nOne stationary source is the Stolthaven New Orleans acrylonitrile storage tank and related \nappurtenances.  The largest acrylonitrile process group (e.g., largest storage tank or \ngroup of interconnected tanks) has a storage capacity of 3,360,000 gallons (22,725,360 \npounds).  The total acrylonitrile stationary storage capacity is 22,725,360 pounds, which \nis stored in a single tank.\n\nThe second stationary source is the cyclohexylamine transfer and loading facility and related\nappurtenances.  The largest cyclohexylamine process group includes an individual rail tankcar of\ncyclohexylamine having a maximum storage capacity of 25,000 gallons (171,175 pounds).\n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per hazardous substance\nhandled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program applicability.  Stolthaven has chosen to use \nDEGADIS+ to determine offsite impacts because both acrylonitrile and cyclohexylamine vapors are \nheavier than air.\n\nFor this facility, a worst-case release of acrylonitrile would occur in the event that the \nlargest (3,360,000-gallon) storage tank would rupture and the entire contents would be released to \nthe atmosphere through evaporation.  This spill was modeled as continuous release because \nit would require more than 60 minutes to evaporate the contents of the tank.  In the case \nof acrylonitrile, the evaporation would take more than 68 hours.  The worst-case scenario \nrequires a ground-level release height (0 feet).\n\nThe DEGADIS+ release model results indicate"

This spill was modeled as continuous release because \nit would require more than 60 minutes to evaporate the contents of the tank.  In the case \nof cyclohexylamine, the evaporation would take more than 40 hours.  The worst-case scenario \nrequires a ground-level release height (0 feet).\n\nThe DEGADIS+ release model results indicate a worst-case impact of 0.40 miles for a cyclohexylamine\nrelease from the facility.  The rule defines the toxic endpoint of cyclohexylamine to be .16 mg/L.  \nThe affected population within a 0.40-mile radius of the facility is 20 based on the 1990 US \nCensus population density data.\n\nThe facility is required to complete one alternate release scenario per regulated chemical \nper 40 CFR Part 68.165(a)(2).  The alternative release scenario considered is in accordance \nwith the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\n\nThe alternative scenarios for both acrylonitrile and cyclohexylamine chosen for this facility \ninvolve releases due to spills occuring during rail tankcar transfer operations.  While these \nscenarios are still unlikely because the operators are continuosly present during transfer \noperations, they are more likely than the worst-case scenarios required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  \nBecause personnel are always present at the facility during transfer, Stolthaven personnel can \nrespond within 5 minutes.  The release rates were calculated as continuous evaporation from an 89 \ngallon spill.  \n\nThe DAGADIS+ release model "
