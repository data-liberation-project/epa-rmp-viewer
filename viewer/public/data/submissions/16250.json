It is Mid-Set Cogeneration Company's policy to comply with all \napplicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Mid-Set Cogeneration \nCompany's objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its \nbusiness activities.\n\nMid-Set Cogeneration Company emphasizes safe and environmentally sound \noperating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In \naddition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive \ntraining in fire prevention, fire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  \nAdditionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Mid-Set \nCogeneration Company and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has \nbeen established.\n\nMid-Set Cogeneration Company has developed a detailed Compliance Audit \nChecklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety \nManagement (PSM) standard and 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP regulations).  At least \nevery three years, Mid-Set Cogeneration Company audits these programs and \nany findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the \ndeficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nTexaco Midway Sunset Cogeneration Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of \nTexaco Producing Inc., formed a general partnership with the Del-Mar Energy \nCompany, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy Company, for \nthe development of the cogeneration plant.  The partnership, named Mid-Set \nCogeneration Company, owns and operates the facility.  The plant began \ncommercial operation in April, 1989.  \n\nThe Mid-Set Cogeneration Company facility is located in Section 36, T31S/R22E, \nMDB&M in the sparsely populated Midway-Sunset oil field.

      "SummaryText": "sest \ncommunity to the plant.\n\nCogeneration, in the case of the Mid-Set project, is the simultaneous production \nof thermal energy and electrical energy from the combustion of a single fuel \nsource.  Combustion of the fuel takes place in a gas turbine that is physically \ncoupled to an electric generator.  Waste heat from the gas turbine's exhaust \nflows into a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).  The HRSG extracts the \nheat from the exhaust gases and produces steam for thermally enhanced oil \nrecovery.  Electricity is produced at the same time via the electric generator \ncoupled to the combustion turbine.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the Mid-Set Cogeneration Company facility to \ncreate a reducing atmosphere in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process.  \nThis reducing atmosphere in the flue gas helps convert nitrogen oxides to \nnitrogen and water as it passes through the catalytic reactor.  The operation of \nthe SCR system substantially lowers the emissions of nitrogen oxides from the \ngas turbine.\n\nLiquid ammonia is stored in a 15,000 gallon (water capacity) storage tank.  The \nmaximum intended inventory of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank is based \non the American National Standard Institute's K61.1 safety requirements and the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations published in \nSection 1910.111 of 29 CFR (and Section 509 of Title 8, CCR).  These standards \nand regulations limit the maximum ammonia storage capacity of the tank to \napproximately 69,960 pounds.\n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define \nthe toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  This \nconcentration has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene \nAssociation as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  \n\nERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that \nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or \ndeveloping i"

The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary \nsource to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must \nanalyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \nSince Mid-Set Cogeneration Company's SCR system is considered a Program 3 \nprocess, both release scenarios were evaluated in the offsite consequence \nanalysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential \npopulation within an area potentially affected by the accidental release scenarios.  \nThis area is defined as a circle with a radius equivalent to the distance the \nrelease would travel with concentrations at or above the endpoint.  This circle \nalso defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be \nidentified.\n\nThe worst case release is defined by the U.S. EPA as the total release of the \ncontents of the single largest vessel or pipe within 10 minutes.  For liquefied \ngases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are \nassumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  \nHowever, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency \nresponse agencies to use for planning purposes.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the \nworst-case release scenario.  For Mid-Set Cogeneration Company, the \nalternative release scenario was selected based on the results of the Hazard and \nOperability Study for the ammonia-based SCR process.

      "SummaryText": "pact.  A failure of the ammonia delivery hose was identified in the \nHazard and Operability Study as the worst credible release event having the \nhighest release rate, and therefore, was chosen as the alternative release \nscenario.    \n\nMid-Set Cogeneration Company has analyzed the offsite consequences of the \nworst-case and alternative release.  For the worst-case release scenario, the \nrelease of 69,960 lbs. of ammonia within 10 minutes, the plume would travel 3.1 \nmiles at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  Using 1990 Census data, the \npopulation potentially affected within the worst-case release scenario circle is 58.  \nThere were no sensitive or environmental receptors within the worst case release \nscenario circle.\n\nIn the alternative release scenario, a failure of the delivery hose was modeled as \na release of liquefied ammonia stored under pressure.  For a release of 554 \nlb/min of anhydrous ammonia, the plume would travel 0.2 mile at concentrations \nat or above the endpoint.  No residences are located within the 0.2 mile area \naround the Mid-Set Cogeneration Company facility.  As such, there would be no \npopulation impacts from the alternative release scenario.  There were also no \nsensitive or environmental receptors within the alternative release scenario circle. \n\nThe modeling performed as part of this offsite consequence analysis does not \ntake into account the use of the remote operated shutoff valves that were \ninstalled at the ammonia tank.  These isolation valves take approximately 10 to \n15 seconds to fully close and could greatly reduce the impact of a hose failure \nrelease. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific \nPrevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release \nprevention program, has been developed at Mid-Set Cogeneration Company to \naddress the anhydrous ammonia system.
