Our management systems address each of the key features of successful accident prevention programs including: Process Safety  Information (PSI), Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractor Safety.  These individual elements of our accident prevention program work together to prevent accidential chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention which meet or exceed regulatory requirements for CFR 40 Part 68, the RMP rule.",

Olin has always had a safety and environmental program, which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable.  Our goal is \"Zero\"  incidents.  To help insure that an emergency situation with off-site consequences will never arise, Olin has put six layers of safety and environmental protection in place: \n\n. Employees\n. Mechanical Integrity\n. Process Hazard Reviews\n. Process Controls\n. Monitoring Systems\n. Emergency Response\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\n\nOur facility produces chlorine, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, and sodium hydrosulfite (along with other industrial chemicals), using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. Olin/Augusta employs approximately 90 people, including engineers, operating and maintenance technicians, and administrative disciplines.  \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs such as PSM, including:\n\n Process safety information\n Process hazard analyses\n Operating procedures\n Training\n Mechanical integrity\n Management of change\n Pre-startup reviews\n Compliance audits\n Incident investigations\n Employee participation\n Hot work permits\n Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nChlorine containment tank to capture chlorine releases from chlorine system relief valves.\nChlorine monitors in the chlorine scrubber stack.\nChlorine recycle system for compressors.\nSulfur "

      "SummaryText": "dioxide monitors at the scrubber and in the vent stacks at the reactors.\nHydrochloric acid loading systems equipped with shut off systems.\nAll loading operations are monitored (Chlorine and HCL).\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.  \n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past five years we have had two accidential releases of chlorine.  One was less than a pound of chlorine released when a chlorinated brine pump failed and a operator nearby was exposed to chlorine fumes requiring oxygen.  There was no offsite impact with this release. The second incident occurred when an overpressurization of the cells resulted in a 77 pound chlorine release resulting in local industries sheltering in place.  Corrective actions have been taken to prevent reoccurance of these items.   \n\nFor these incidents, we conducted a formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root cause of these releases.\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Augusta-Richmond County Emergency Operations Plan.  \n\nThe following is a list of improvements we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\nA new sulfur dioxide storage tank.\nAutomatic shutoff system for liquid sulfur dioxide unloading station."
