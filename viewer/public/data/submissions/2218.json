This should decrease response time in the event of a release.\n\nAll containers are changed by two people, one of which is a certified operator who is in charge of the operation.  Untrained operators are not allowed to connect or disconnect containers.\n\nChlorine is only fed from one container at a time and valve is turned off when plant is not in operation.\n\nThe manifold system is of the vacuum demand type which shut off the container if there is a leak anywhere between the container and the chlorinators.\n\nIn the event of a chlorine leak, the alarm system sounds in the laboratory and at the communication center.  The leak detection system does not convey the everity of the leak only that the leak is above the detection level of the sensor (3 mg/l).\n\nThe first operator aware of any leak is responsible for notifying all plant personnel to evacuate the affected area(s) and calling 911.  If the leak is in the chlorine building and it is safe to do so, the leak is to be contained by closing the doors (if they are open) and turning off the ventilation system.  This minimizes exposure to plant personnel and gives the Emergincy Services Co-ordinator time to get a response team on site to stop / repair the leak. A one ton repair kit is kept at the wastewater treatment plant at all times.\n\nChlorine has a yellowish green appearance and can be recognized by a sharp smell.  Personnel are trained to take note of the wind direction via the wind sock so as to move upwind of any leak and to be aware of the corrosive nature (when wetted) with regard to the extensive damage that will occur to metal structures and vehicles.\n\nThe wearing of the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus by personnel whil changing container is not to be confused with having training to enter a chlorine atmosphere to effect a repair.  Plant personnel do not have the training and / or the necessary equipment and cou"
