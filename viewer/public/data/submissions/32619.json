The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) Central District Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) also uses chlorine (for chlorination) for disinfecting treated wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The Central District WWTP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes care in treating wastewater.  The Central District WWTP also produces digester gas and stores it for on-site use as fuel.\n\nThe Central District WWTP chlorine and digester gas handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\n\n      - Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n      - General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n      - Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n      - Five-year accident history summary.\n\n      - Emergency response program summary.\n\n      - Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the Central District WWTP chlorine and digester gas systems are provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MDWASD accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.

Central District WWTP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the treatment plant to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  Central District WWTP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe MDWASD Central District WWTP is located on Virginia Key in Miami, Florida.  The Central District WWTP has two separate liquid treatment trains that are referred to as Plant 1 and Plant 2 and are rated at 60 mgd and 83 mgd, respectively.  The facility stores chlorine and digester gas, which are regulated toxic substances under RMP rule.  The two chlorine systems (for Plant 1 & 2) supply approximately 7,400 pounds of chlorine per day to the wastewater effluent and the non-potable water system.\n\nAt Plant 1, chlorine is delivered in one-ton containers to the storage area of the Central District WWTP chlorine building.  The chlorine building is divided into a covered chlorine storage area and a chlorinator room.  The one-ton containers contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The storage area in Plant 1 is equipped to store up to 32 (cylinders) tons of chlorine.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Central District Plant 1 WWTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the EPA rule.

Pressing one of the automatic shut-off switches can manually close the shut-off valve.  The valve will also close automatically when the chlorine sensor senses a leak.  The liquid chlorine flows through the automatic shut-off valve to the evaporators.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The gas then flows from the evaporator to the chlorinator.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas rotameter and a v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the plant water produces the concentrated solution that flows through piping to various injections points in the treatment process.\n\nThe Plant 1 chlorination process of the Central District WWTP is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  The two important safety features are (1) automatic shut-off valves and (2) chlorine leak detection and alarm system.  The automatic shut-off valves are located immediately downstream of the chlorine containers.  Therefore, if a leak occurs anywhere in the system, the chlorine source can be isolated and the flow of chlorine can be stopped.  The automatic shut-off valves are operated either automatically due to the detection of chlorine leak by the chlorine sensors or manually by pushing a switch.
