      "SummaryText": "Per Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the final Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program rule on June 20, 1996.  This rule was published in the Federal Register of June 20, 1996 and codified in the Code of Federal Regulaitons (40 CFR 68).  It requires owners or operators of a covered stationary source to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) by June 21, 1999.  The Rule is also known as the RMP Rule.\n\nSenate Bill 1889 requires California to implement the federally mandated Accidental Release Prevention Program.  Effective January 1, 1997, the new California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal ARP) replaced the California Risk Managemnt and Prevention Program (RMPP).  Under the CalARP program, the owner or operator of a stationary source is required to submit a single RMP to the local \"Administering Agency\" (AA) integrating the federal and state specific requirements.\n\nBased on the data collected and federal and state regulations applicability anaysis conducted by Environmental Science and Engineering, Inc., it was determined that RSM's toluene diisocyanate (TDI) system (used in the polyurethane resin production) is the covered process; because the quantity of TDI stored at the facility exceeds the regulatory threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (under federal regulations) and 500 pounds (under California regulaitons) for this chemical.  The facility is subject to Program 1 requirements because of the offsite consquence analysis that was performed by ESE indicated no offsite impact from the TDI Process.  Additionally, there has been no accident with offsite consequences within the last five years.  Results of the hazard assessment conducted using EPA-approved SCREEN3 model indicate that the furthest distance to the \"endpoint\" of a worst-case is approximately 88 feet.  There are no public and environmental receptors within the vulnerable zone.\n\nTo comply with the federal and state regul"

      "SummaryText": "ations, McWhorter Technologies, Inc (McWhorter) contracted Environmental Science & Engineering (formerly QST Environmental, Inc.) to prepare a RMP for their facility located at 2801 Lynwood Road, Lynwood, California, 90262. The McWhorter RMP was submitted by McWhorter in February, 1999.  In July of 2000, McWhorter was purchased by Eastman Chemical Company (Eastman).  An update to the RMP was submitted at that time to note the change in ownership and emergency contacts. Another update was submitted by Eastman in June, 2004 to comply with the 2004 update requirements. On August 1, 2004, Resolution Specialty Materials LLC (RSM) purchased the facility from Eastman. \n\nOn August 15, 2005 RSM merged into Hexion Specialty Chemicals, Inc. This update is being submitted to note the change in name and emergency contacts."
