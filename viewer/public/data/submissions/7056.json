Intermediates in the manufacture of the products include nitric acid, and ammonium nitrate solution. The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are ammonia, chlorine and hydrogen.\n\nIt is Terra Nitrogen's policy to prevent accidental releases from the Woodward Plant by effective process safety management programs and procedures that include: participation by all plant employees in every element of PSM; regular analysis of process hazards utilizing current and accurate process safety information; maintaining current and accurate written operating procedures; providing timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment; overseeing the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their job safely; following established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety; administering a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practices and accepted industry standards; investigation of incidents when they do occur to promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience, and audit the entire PSM program on a regular basis to verify that all elements, procedures, and systems are in place and adequate. In addition, it is the Woodward Plants policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan, a system to notify facility neighbors in the event of a release, and to coordinate emergency response planning with local authorities and exercise those plans annually.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\nThe Woodward Plant's"

The Alternative Release Scenario for ammonia is a 2\" pipe break, resulting in the release of 5,400 pounds over a 10-minute period. The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 PPM) is estimated to be 0.35 miles. The Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine is a 3/8\" pipe break resulting is a release of 1,560 pounds over a 120 minute period. The distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine (3 PPM) is estimated to be 0.51 miles. The Woodward Plant Flammable Worst Case Scenario involves hydrogen and has offsite impact. The Alternative Release Scenario for hydrogen is a 1\" pipe break resulting in a release of 540 pounds over 10-minute period. The distance to the flammable endpoint (3.3% volume-LFL) is estimated to be 0.06 miles. The impact from the Alternative Release Scenario for hydrogen is limited by emergency shutdown procedures.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe Woodward Plant has a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals found in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.
