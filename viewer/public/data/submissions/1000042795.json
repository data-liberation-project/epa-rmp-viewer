The policy mandates ANSI K61.1, A?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous AmmoniaA?. This standard closely resembles the required regulation under OSHA 1910.111. Company policy also requires the implementation of specific engineering and administrative controls to prevent releases as well as a complete Safety & Health Program. Airgas Specialty Products does not respond to releases but maintains an Emergency Action Plan that is coordinated with local responders.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia at a concentration greater than 20% are stored and distributed from this location. Ammonia is stored in ASME coded pressure vessels and maintained in totally enclosed systems from railcar to distribution vessels, minimizing transfer losses and accidental release potential.\n\nAirgas Specialty Products has developed and implemented procedures specific to storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia to meet the requirements of a prevention program as outlined in the regulation. Process safety information was gathered specific to the process and a process hazard analysis was conducted and operating procedures were written based upon the process safety information and process hazard analysis. Training was developed and provided to all employees. All other elements of the prevention program has been addressed and followed per the RMP and PSM regulations.\n\nThis Airgas Specialty Products location has not had any RMP defined accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nAirgas Specialty Products has a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia. The plan includes procedures for informing all on-site personnel as well as the required notification of emergency response personnel (local fire department, state and federal agencies).\n\nThi"
