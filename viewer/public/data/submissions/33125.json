Using the OCA Guidance of modeling the offsite projected area includes less than 300 feet or 100 yards.  In addition to the containment basin, a new diked area has been installed to contain material in case of a leak in piping or hose from base of tank to filling valves.

Proper procedures are then followed to insure spills or leaks are contained and neutralized.  Drills have been performed to act out such an emergency situation.  Members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local community will be contacted if a worst case scenario release occurs.  Upon arrival of the Richland County LEPC the Safety Director will advise LEPC of the situation and a plan of action will result.\n\nQuaker Chemical continues to attend meetings and stay current with the Richland County LEPC.  \n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety:\n\nQuaker Chemical Company, Inc. is always looking for ways to improve safety in its everyday operations.  Frequent safety training and review has been the key to our success at Quaker.  Our Safety Committee meets periodically to discuss safety issues including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), pipes, pumps, valves, fittings, containment strategies, tanks, as well as manufacturing and storage procedures. In 2001 Quaker assigned Mr. Travis Copeland as Safety Director for the company to oversee all OSHA, EPA, and company safety issues.  There are no specific changes planned for normal operations, yet we continue to follow our maintenance schedule for all equipment used in handling the Hydrofluoric Acid to insure a safe working environment every day."
