The PHA was completed using the Refrigeration Contractor that was building the system, the general contractor, the refrigeration contractor retained by WinCo to operate and maintain the refrigeration system, Facility Maintenance Managers from WinCo's other ammonia refrigerated DC's, WinCo's Warehouse Manager for the Denton DC and WinCo's Director of Environmental Compliance.  The PHA was facilitated by an experienced RMP/PSM refrigeration engineer from Republic Refrigeration.\n\n\n\nWinCo's implementation of the RMP/PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The Plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (Mechanical Integrity) for the ammonia refrigeration system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system.  In addition the program includes spec"
