Mission states To provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public.  In order to fulfill this mission, Schmitz Grain provides a EHS group to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures.  EHS field safety services supervisors audit and nonitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\nThis facility maintains approximately 6, 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and 13, 1,500 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 116,000 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 1 stationary storage tank (s) [1 @ 30,000 gallons,] on site.  140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of storage tanks.  In addition, anhydrous ammonia may be stored temporarily in up to 0 rail cars.  The maximum quantity anhydrous ammonia that may be stored in rail cars is 0 pounds.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 256,000#.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 140,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario.\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that Schmitz Grain, Inc. has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\nAlternative Release scenario\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario"

It should be noted Schmitz Grain, Inc. has not had a release of this type from any distibution facility.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nThe ammonia system is desinged, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM stadards and ASME codes.  This facility complies with the MN Dept. of Ag. standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves and manual shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excell flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenace scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist surveys forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal state and local regulations are covered.
