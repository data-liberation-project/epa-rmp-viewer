This summary provides the following items:\nAccidental release prevention and response policies \nDescription of the stationary source and regulated substances\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\nFive-year accident history \nEmergency response program \nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Phillips 66 Company and FHR Lubricants, LLC partnership - Excel Paralubes site has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site is located in Westlake, Louisiana. It operates a variety of processes that takes vacuum gas oil (an intermediate product from the refining of raw crude oil) and produces petroleum products such as naphtha, kerosene, diesel, and lubricant base oils. The Excel Paralubes site has regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, NFPA4 flammable mixtures, and hydrogen. The site also has several RMP listed toxic substances, but none at or above the threshold quantity or concentration specified in the regulation.\n\nDuring the preparation for this RMP resubmission, Phillips 66 reevaluated how the flammable mixture\u0092s total quantities were aggregated in each process unit\u0092s maximum inten"

There were no major changes to any of the processes or changes to Phillips 66\u0092s RMP covered chemicals.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Excel Paralubes site. Site processes are regulated by both the EPA RMP rule the OSHA PSM standard. This summary addresses the elements of these requirements and describes the management system in place to address the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in each element of process safety and the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the site. The Plan includes employee work groups and teams with documented action plans to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. Employees are actively involved in the sites formal process safety / risk management audit program and participate as auditors and auditees.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site keeps a variety of technical documents referred to as Process Technology Packages (PTP's).

Specific departments within the site are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to assist employees in locating process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the site has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limit (SOL) section of the PTP. Site operations and maintenance personnel ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe site also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety systems in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site has a comprehensive PHA program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and effectively controlled.

In addition, the HAZOP process utilizes a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) which applies industry failure rates to a scenario to calculate a threshold value. The combination of HAZOP / LOPA and What-lf checklist is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique. The analyses are conducted using a qualified team of personnel who have operating and maintenance experience, process engineering expertise, and experience in the hazard's evaluation techniques. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and provides suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team determines such improvements are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive priority attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked through completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Excel Paralubes site periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training for new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them through the management of change process as may be necessary.\n\nIn addition, the Excel Paralubes site maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Excel Paralubes site has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in site operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning work. In addition, the site evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that change has been properly evaluated and implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site has well-established"
