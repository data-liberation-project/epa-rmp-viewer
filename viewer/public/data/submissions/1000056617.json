Freedom Pines hosts the local Fire Department for training exercises and has included local emergency responders in third-party training paid for by Freedom Pines. While LanzaTech staff are not expected to respond directly to an emergency, LanzaTech provides HAZWOPER training to Operations staff. Freedom Pines is equipped with a helicopter landing area to handle emergency medical situations. The site is also equipped with an emergency siren that will alert both employees and the local area in the event of an emergency at the site. All staff and visitors are trained in procedures for evacuation, including emergency gathering points that are outside the process area."

Safety statistics for the entire company are reported weekly to employees at all LanzaTech locations. LanzaTech encourages a strong safety culture that promotes the use of Near Miss Reports (policy LZT-OP5-0380-2) for early detection of potential hazards. LanzaTech has engaged a third party, SWS Environmental Services, to respond in the event of any accidental release at Freedom Pines.\r\n\r\nChemical safety at Freedom Pines is covered in the Freedom Pines Environmental, Health and Safety Management Plan (LZT-OP5-021-0) and in supporting policies such as: Compressed Gas Cylinder Safety policies (LZT-OP5-009-2, LZT-OP5-009-5, LZT-OP5-010-3); Hazadous Waste Disposal (LZT-OP5-085-1) and Waste Management (LZT-OP5-079-3); and Emergency Egress and Fire Protection (LZT-OP5-016-1). A number of policies are in place to ensure safety in  Freedom Pines  Operations that involve chemicals. Although Freedom Pines is not subject to PSM, corporate HS&E policies cover many of the same elements of safety, including Process Hazard Analysis (LZT-OP5-044-1), Pre-Startup Safety Review (LZT-OP5-048-1), Hot Work Policy and Permits (LZT-OP5-049-1, LZT-OP5-050-1, LZT-OP5-051-1), Line and Equipment Break policies (LZT-OP5-052-2, LZT-OP5-053-1, LZT-OP5-054-3). Lockout, Tagout and Try Policy and Permits (LZT-OP5-055-1, LZT-OP5-056-1), and Management of Change (LZT-OP5-057-1). \r\n\r\nFreedom Pines is a research and development facility located on approximately 260 acres in a rural area outside of Soperton, Georgia. The Freedom Pines process area is positioned near the middle of the site. All process units, feed tanks and product storage tanks at Freedom Pines are in secondary containment to prevent accidental release. The nearest neighbors (residences or businesses) are over 0.3 miles from the process area. The Freedom Pines acreage and"

      "SummaryText": "layout, combined with the scale of R&D activities performed at site, mean that the site poses essentially no risk to the community. \r\n\r\nLanzaTech is developing and testing gas fermentation at Freedom Pines, in which gases are biologically converted to fuels and chemicals in laboratory and pilot bioreactors. LanzaTech is also developing a process to convert ethanol into jet fuel, which is being implemented at pilot scale in Freedom Pines. The first step in ethanol conversion to jet fuel is catalytic dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, a regulated substance. The ethylene is then catalytically converted to longer-chain olefins in an oligomerization unit. Ethylene from the ethanol dehydration reactor is fed directly into the ethylene oligomerization unit after passing through gas clean up beds; therefore, there is no permanent storage of pure ethylene at Freedom Pines. The Ethylene Feed Test process was set up to investigate the effects of commercial ethylene feed on the existing ethylene oligomerization unit. For the Ethylene Feed Test, 13,000 lb of ethylene were delivered by Airgas to Freedom Pines in a tube trailer with 8 interconnected cylinders. The tube trailer was positioned adjacent to the bunded area containing the ethylene oligomerization unit. The Worst Case Release scenario entered into RMP*Comp considered release of all 13,000 lb, although multiple cylinders were isolated from the process at any given time. \r\n\r\nLanzaTech  has had no accidental releases of a regulated substance at Freedom Pines since acquiring the site in 2012. \r\n\r\nFreedom Pines works closely with the community and local Emergency Responders to ensure that all are informed about activities at Freedom Pines. Freedom Pines has a Community Advisory Board composed of citizens from the community. The Advisory Board includes representation from the Soperton School District and the Treutlen County Development Authority, as well as local business people and other residents.
