This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release were to occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Jacksonville Fire and Rescue, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2    THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is over the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3    THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to Emergency\n\nPlanning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        1.3.1    Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nComplete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM program and to other aspects such as the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).

MSDS information can provide a portion of the required data but other information will be required.\n\n\n\n                        1.3.2   Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled safely. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist. The studies are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least every five years. Any recommendations related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nSysco Jacksonville, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4    Training\n\n\n\nSysco Jacksonville, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating or maintaining the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in the operating and maintenance procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5    Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nSysco Jacksonville, Inc. carries out highly documented m"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.\n\nFurthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified during preventive maintenance are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.6    Management of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco Jacksonville, Inc. to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given, training to deal with the modifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.7    Pre-Startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes, and to modifications of established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Sysco Jacksonville, Inc...
