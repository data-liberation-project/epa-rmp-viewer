      "SummaryText": "The Beckley Water Company water treatment system utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection purposes. The facility utilizes one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas which are received at the facility every 2 months with five (5) cylinders delivered at any one time. Up to seven (7) cylinders are maintained on-site at any one time. Two (2) cylinders are stored in the chlorine room, the rest are stored in a concrete site covered with a roof and secured with a chain. The average chlorine usage at this facility is 150 to 400 pounds per day. The Beckley Water Company water system utilizes a Wallace and Tiernan (WT) chlorinator system. This system operates such that the chlorine transfer from the cylinder to the chlorinators is under vacuum verses pressure. This type of arrangement provides for minimal potential for leaks of chlorine through the piping. The only section of the system which is not under vacuum is the piping from the cylinder valves to the cylinder manifold which is under pressure. The facility has a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the equipment that handles chlorine gas in a good operating mode.  Chlorine cylinders are received from the vendor and the transfer of the cylinders from the truck is always performed during daylight hours, and is attended by the truck driver and a Beckley Water Company employee. The Beckley Water Company Glade Creek Plant is manned by at least one employee twenty-four hours per day. There is a chlorine sensor system located at the facility. This sensor is designed to detect any chlorine release within the chlorinator room. The chlorinator room is designed within exhaust fan that automatically starts if a chlorine release is identified by the sensor.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario identified for this facility would be for failure of the yoke piping which connects to the cylinder. Ifthis piping and related regulator valve failed, a maximum of 50 pounds per hour of chlorine gas could be released from one cylinder."

      "SummaryText": "EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nIn the event of a severe chlorine release, the Beckley Water Company employees are instructed to call 911 and request assistance from the Ghent Volunteer Fire Department.  The Ghent Volunteer Fire Department personnel can respond within 10 minutes and have the adequate personal protective equipment to isolate valves in the event of such an incident.  Regarding lower volume incidents involving minor leaks, the Beckley Water Company has a contract with C.I. Thornburg, the supplier of chlorine cylinders to the facility, provides emergency response to any chlorine releases.  The C.I. Thornburg personnel can be on-site within 2 hours of notification.  Once the chlorine usage area has been adequately ventilated and the release of chlorine stopped, Beckley Water Company personnel will enter into the area to perform any necessary repair work.  Beckley Water Company personnel will enter into the chlorine usage area in the event of an alarm situation to assess the condition and perform minor emergency response.  The facility is covered under a general emergency response plan implemented by the Raleigh County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The facility also has an emergency response plan for evacuation of employees and performance of critical operations in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nEight (8) employees of the Beckley Water Company received chlorine awareness training from C.I. Thornburg, the supplier of the chlorine cylinders.  This training was performed in order to insure that personnel understand the hazards of dealing with chlorine gas and are familiar with the routine tasks associated with their jobs, as well as the emergency response procedures necessary to be followed in the event of a chlorine release.  The supplier of chlorine cylinders may change on an annual basis.  Any such change will result in modification of this section of the risk management plan to insure that the current supplier is listed.\r\n\r\nAFFECTED AR"
