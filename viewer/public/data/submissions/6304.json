The unloading of ammonia tank trucks is also governed by Plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\n10/8/98 - ammonia pump (10-110-045A)\n09/98 - Tested Pressure Relief Valves\n07/07/98 - Storage Tank Inspection (10-110-044)\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area. All nozzles on the tank are fitted with excess flow valves except for nozzles with pressure relief valves. Redundant level instruments are used to monitor and control tank level.\n\nThe pressure relief valves are tested annually. The entire system undergoes annual maintenance which includes: external inspection, checks for any leaks, bolt tightness on the manway. Wall thickness tests are done every five years - the last test was 1997. An internal inspection of the welds was done in 1991.\n\nAmmonia is transferred to an ammonia / water mixer to prepare a solution that is pumped to a surge tank . The solution is then pumped to the chemical processing equipment and used to manufacture an agricultural product.\n\nAll changes to this system fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure.

Operators are trained and certified.\nPump 02-140-002A & B\nPump 02-130-009A & B\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area. The tank contents are maintained at  about 40 degrees F. This tank vents via a conservation vent to a seal pot and then to an incinerator where the fumes are destroyed. Two flare systems are used to back up the incinerator for odor control.\n\nThe tank is equipped with emergency relief devices to protect against overpressurization. Redundant level instruments are used to monitor and control tank level. During railcar/tank truck unloading, an excess flow switch in the unloading system is used to close the automatic valve if high flow is detected. \n\nThe mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to produce an agricultural product. This equipment is equipped with a high level alarm and a high level switch that is interlocked to shutdown the feed and close the automatic valve. The reactor fumes are vented via a seal pot on their way to the incinerator for destruction. This system is also governed by operating procedures used by certified operators.\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. PHAs are conducted for all changes.\n\nThe entire mercaptan handling system undergoes annual maintenance and inspection as well as a five-year, vessel and piping thickness testing program and a 20 year internal inspection.",

At our Hannibal Plant, we are very concerned with the protection of our employees and our environment. We are also concerned with protecting our families that live in the communities around our facility.  We have designed our facilities to safely manage the chemicals used and produced within our production operations. It is our policy to not only to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations but also to voluntarily go beyond these requirements to help ensure our continued successful safe operations.  Following is a list of several of the major programs we have developed and implemented to help achieve our goals:\n \n7 State of the art process equipment and process control design incorporating safety devices and systems needed to properly handle, store or use materials in our processes\n7 Well-defined and documented operating procedures and control systems\n7 An extensive safety and process safety management system\n7 Well-trained production employees coupled to a highly trained technical staff\n7 An extensive preventive maintenance and equipment inspection program\n7 Site access restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors\n\nIn addition to these preventative programs, it is the Plant's policy to maintain an up-to-date emergency response plan and trained personnel and response equipment to be prepared to respond to potential emergencies involving fire, releases of hazardous material, medical emergencies, and confined space rescue. The plant works closely with area community emergency response agencies providing them with information on plant operations and response programs in addition to conducting periodic training with members of the local emergency response agencies.\n\nCyanamid's Hannibal facility has two substances that exceed the RMP threshold quantities.

These compounds are used as raw materials in the production of agricultural products at the Hannibal Plant.\n\nLiquid, anhydrous ammonia is received by tank truck (approximately 26,000 lb./truck) and is stored in a single steel tank at ambient temperature and under its own vapor pressure. This tank is located within a concrete secondary containment system.  The tank is equipped with overpressure protection and is rated to withstand full vacuum. The total ammonia inventory is 41,000 lb. that  includes the amount in the storage tank and associated piping that handle anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia handling system consists of an unloading station with secondary containment system,  storage tank, two pumps and piping.  As for all operations at this facility, this system is governed by well-established operating procedures.\n\nEthyl mercaptan is typically received by railroad tank car (about 140,000 lb./car). Up to eight tank cars may be in the receiving area on the Plant site awaiting unloading into the dedicated ethyl mercaptan storage tank. The maximum total inventory for the eight tank cars is 1,100,000 lb.  When needed, a tank car is moved to the unloading area using a Trackmobile operated by Cyanamid personnel.  The railcar is positioned inside a concrete secondary containment system in the unloading area and is then connected to the ethyl mercaptan storage tank to unload. Ethyl mercaptan may also be received by tank truck in quantities of approximately 5,000 gallons.  Trucks are also unloaded in concrete secondary containment systems provided for unloading.\n\nThe ethyl mercaptan storage tank is located inside a concrete secondary containment system. The mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to manufacture an agricultural product.

(Active mitigation systems were not considered according to EPA guidelines for worst cases.) Although the storage tank is designed to store approximately 48,000 lb. Plant administrative controls limit the amount to 39,000 lb. For this scenario, it is assumed that the entire contents of the tank are released as a gas over ten minutes according the EPA requirements for a pressurized, liquified substance. The distance to the EPA-defined toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/liter) is 3.6 miles. The EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) version 1.06 was used to estimate the distance.\n\nAlternative scenario - ammonia: For the alternative scenario it was assumed that while unloading a tank truck, the liquid ammonia unloading hose fails due to movement of the tank truck.  It was assumed that the truck was improperly set up for unloading.  Additionally, it was assumed that all systems designed to prevent ammonia release operated except the excess flow valve in the liquid line connected to the flexible hose.  It was estimated that 14,000 lb. of ammonia would be released.  The Plant's ability to use the firewater system to knock down and dissolve ammonia vapors was not assumed as active mitigation for this scenario even though the system is designed for use in this type of incident.  The distance to the EPA toxic endpoint was estimated to be 0.8 miles using RMP*Comp (tm) version 1.06.\n\nWorst case scenario - ethyl mercaptan: For this scenario it was assumed that all eight tank cars of ethyl mercaptan which may be in inventory are stored adjacent to each other and are involved in a common incident causing the simultaneous release of the mercaptan from all tanks.
