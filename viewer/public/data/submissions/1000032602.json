This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, we coordinate our response efforts with the Strawberry Point Fire Department and the Clayton County LEPC, which provide emergency response expertise to help limit the release distances and lower the potential risk of impacts.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in a bulk storage tank at our facility in Strawberry Point.  With added capacity in on-site nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThis facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anydrous Ammonia and our State Regulations covering anyhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nSilverEdge Coop has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention polices, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nSilveEdge Coop maintains a written emergency response plan which is coordinated with the local fire department and the LEPC.  The plan is intended to assist responding agencies to address all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety"
