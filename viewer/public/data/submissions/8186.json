The most recent review was performed on 05/12/1999.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCountry Fresh McDonald  Dairy Division conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 5/12/99.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCountry Fresh McDonald  Dairy Division promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCountry Fresh McDonald  Dairy Division truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from McDonald Refrigeration System.  In this scenario 6000 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 100% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.
