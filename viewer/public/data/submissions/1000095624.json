The Company's officers, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the Company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. Mattingly has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances. Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program. In the event of a release, the facility will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nMattingly Foods is a packaged wholesale food distributor. Ammonia refrigeration is used to cool or freeze food products. Ammonia refrigeration is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.  Liquid ammonia is changed to a gas and then condensed for reuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nMattingly Foods has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely. The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies and materials requirements to minimize the possibility of releases. These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices. Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards. Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nMattingly Foods has not had any reportable accidental releases in the past five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nThe local fire department provides emergency response. Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, police, rescue"
