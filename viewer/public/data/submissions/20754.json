      "SummaryText": "PREFACE\nThis submission amends a June 1999 predictive filing for two processes at the Washington Steel facility located in Massillon, Ohio that use hydrofluoric acid.  Amendments to the previous filing were needed to report a change in the owner of the facility.  The new owner is Massillon Stainless, Inc.  Massillon Stainless acquired this facility from Bethlehem Steel on 01/14/2000.  At the time of this filing, all of the processes were idle and no hydrofluoric acid was present at the facility.  Massillon Stainless expects to resume operation of the processes that use hydrofluoric acid during calendar year 2000.  Appropriate corrections have been made to this document to reflect the expected process startup schedule.  If the startup schedule is accelerated, the process changes resulting from the original hazard review will also be implemented on an accelerated schedule.  All references to Washington Steel in the previous document have been changed to Massillon Stainless to indicate the new owner's acceptance of the commitments to process safety and risk management made by the prior owners.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nMassillon Stainless reviews the properties of each material used at the facility to ensure that the material is handled in a way that minimizes the potential for accidental releases that could endanger public health or the environment.  The company's processes and equipment are designed to meet industry-specific design codes and standards (where established) and the company employs industry-accepted practices in its operations.  All federal and state regulations that pertain to the materials and processes are complied with.  Where appropriate, written procedures are developed and employees are trained to ensure that they perform their jobs safely and without incident.\n\nKnowing that releases may occur in spite of the company's efforts to prevent them, Massillon Stainless has developed a document that sets forth the pro"

This document describes the types of releases facility employees should anticipate, defines the procedures to be followed in dealing with the releases, identifies the persons and agencies to be notified in the event of a release and to be called upon in the event assistance is needed and establishes the internal chain of command.  The document includes the telephone number of the Stark County LEPC and the local fire, police and hospital in the event the release has the potential to affect persons offsite. \n\nSOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nMassillon Stainless finishes stainless steel sheet and strip at the Massillon Plant.  The company uses a dilute solution that contains hydrofluoric acid and other ingredients in a production process known as pickling.  The hydrofluoric acid purchased for use in the process is stored as a 70% solution in aboveground tanks.  The acid is transferred from the storage tanks to the pickling tubs by pipelines as needed to maintain the strength of the solution.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case release scenario would result from the failure of one of the two hydrofluoric acid storage tanks located at the facility when it is full.  Although the acid released from the tank would be contained in a diked area beneath the tank or flow to a nearby drain, EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance predicts the distance to the toxic endpoint at 0.62 miles for one of the tanks and 0.81 miles for the other tank.  Within 0.62 miles of the one tank are residences, public recreational areas and commercial and industrial areas.  Approximately 1,000 people reside within the area based on 1990 Census data for the City of Massillon.  Within 0.81 miles of the other tank are residences, a school, a prison, public recreational areas and commercial and industrial areas.  Approximately 1,500 people reside within 0.81 miles of the tank based on the Census data.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENAR"

      "SummaryText": "IO\nA release that is more likely to occur than the failure of the hydrofluoric acid storage tank and that would reach an endpoint offsite if it occurred is a release during the delivery of acid from a transfer hose rupture.  Based on the facility's assessment, a transfer hose rupture would release approximately 65 gallons per minute but would last less than 1 minute.  EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance predicts the distance to the toxic endpoint from this type of release at 0.06 miles for one of the transfer locations and 0.19 miles for the other transfer location.  The difference in the distances is due to the presence of a drain at one location that mitigates the impact of the release.  There are no public receptors within 0.06 miles of the one location.  The only public receptor within 0.19 miles of the other location is an adjoining industrial area.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nMassillon Stainless and the Massillon Plant's previous owners have used 70% hydrofluoric acid in their pickling process for more than 50 years.  During that time, relatively few releases have occurred.  This is due to the fact that the company uses equipment that is compatible with the acid and designed for its intended service, inspects the equipment routinely and trains its operations and maintenance personnel to carry out their duties safely. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThis facility has had no accidents involving 70% hydrofluoric acid in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nMassillon Stainless' existing emergency response program includes measures to respond to releases internally, identifies outside contractors the company can call upon for support, and provides telephone numbers to call if it becomes necessary to notify the public or request assistance from response agencies (fire, medical, etc.).  The program has been coordinated with the Stark County LEPC.  Massillon Stainless personnel, who are fam"

By reducing the surface area, the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release will be reduced from 0.81 miles to 0.62 miles and fewer public receptors will be within the area.  A number of other changes to the process are also planned, which are designed to reduce the likelihood of a release that has offsite consequences."
