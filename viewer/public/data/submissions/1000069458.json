To meet this commitment, we have\r\nestablished systems to ensure safe operation of plant processes, which includes the safe and proper\r\nhandling of hazardous substances at the plant.  One component of these systems is a Risk\r\nManagement Program (RMP), which manages the risks involved with using hazardous substances. \r\nWateree Station's RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's\r\n(EPA's) regulation 40 CFR \u0015 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management\r\nPrograms.  This regulation is also referred to as the RMP rule.  One of the requirements of the\r\nRMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing\r\nthe RMP at the Wateree Station.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary\r\nrequirement of the RMP rule and to provide a description of the RMP.  \r\n\r\nThe Wateree Station is the largest fossil plant in SCE&G system.  The plant generates 700\r\nmegawatts of electricity by burning pulverized coal in two identical generation units.  Wateree\r\nStation's Unit 1 began commercial operation in 1970, and Unit 2 began operation in 1971.  To\r\ncomply with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, SCE&G must reduce 85% of the total Nitrogen\r\nOxides (NOx) emitted system-wide by May, 2004.  After exhaustive studies, SCE&G determined\r\nthat Wateree Station would install a Selective Catalytic Reduction Reactor (SCR) for each of\r\nWateree Station's generating units.  Inside each SCR, anhydrous ammon"

Design engineering\r\nindicated the need to install two 60,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks to support\r\noperation of the SCRs.  Operation of the SCRs will be year round.\r\n\r\nThe Wateree Station Risk Management Program consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n  1. A hazard assessment to identify (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental\r\n  releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the\r\n  substances regulated by the RMP rule (see Sections 3 and 5 of this executive summary);\r\n  \r\n  2.

An emergency response program to provide guidance to the plant for responding to accidental\r\n  releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule (see Section 6 of this\r\n  executive summary).\r\n\r\nAlthough the RMPlan helps ensure that Wateree Station's RMP covered system is maintained and\r\noperated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the plant's overall safety program.  In fact,\r\na comprehensive safety program exists that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nLimiting the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nSCE&G did perform a thorough evaluation before selecting a pollution control technology that uses\r\na hazardous substance regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substance).

In the unlikely event of a release, employees are trained to recognize accidental\r\nreleases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release. \r\nCoordination with the county's Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) is crucial to protect\r\nthe health and safety of the surrounding community.  Emergency planning efforts have been\r\nperformed with Richland County Emergency Services, and SCE&G will continue to work closely\r\nwith them.  In addition, the LEPCs for the adjacent communities (Sumter County and Calhoun\r\nCounty) have been informed.  In short, actions have been taken to ensure appropriate plans are in\r\nplace to minimize the impact of a release on our employees and the community.\r\n\r\n\fThe SCE&G safety program consists of a number of elements, many of which are beyond what is\r\nrequired by the RMP rule.

REGULATED SUBSTANCE USED AT SCE&G WATEREE STATION\r\n\r\nThe Wateree Station has one substance (anhydrous ammonia) in sufficient quantity to be regulated\r\nby the RMP rule.  The anhydrous ammonia used at the plant is covered as a toxic material by the\r\nRMP rule.  As stated previously, anhydrous ammonia will be used as a reactant to reduce the\r\nemission of NOx from the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit\r\nprogram is included in our new employee orientation.\r\n   \f   4.1.12   Contractors\r\n\r\nA program is in place to help ensure that contractor activities related to the RMP covered ammonia\r\nsystem are performed in a safe manner.  Contractor supervisors are informed of the hazards of the\r\nprocesses on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency\r\nresponse procedures.  Contractors are required to ensure that training has been performed for each\r\nof their employees before he/she performs work at the plant.  Routine verification that this training\r\nhas been provided is performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2   Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, safety features specific to the anhydrous\r\nammonia process have been implemented.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia is delivered in tank trucks that must be approved by the Department of\r\nTransportation.  The plant's anhydrous ammonia storage tanks and equipment are designed and\r\nmaintained to standards established by the federal government and by industry.  Manual shutoff\r\nvalves, excess flow devices in the storage tank, and ammonia detectors with alarms are"

The training program\r\nincludes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the system, (b) the\r\nproperties and hazards of anhydrous ammonia, and (c) a detailed review of the operating procedures\r\nand safe work practices.  Classroom training and demonstrations are used to help impart knowledge\r\nto the employees.  Tests and demonstrations are used to verify that an employee understands the\r\ntraining material before the employee can work on the anhydrous ammonia system.\r\n\r\n     4.1.5  Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia handling equipment is maintained to help prevent equipment failures that\r\ncould endanger employees and contractors, the public, or the environment. The mechanical integrity\r\n(preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify\r\nequipment deterioration and damage well before the equipment can fail and (b) a quality assurance\r\nfunction to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required\r\nfor service in our process.\r\n\r\n     4.1.6  Management of Change\r\n\r\nThe Management of Change procedure is a written procedure that requires the review and approval\r\nof all proposed changes to the anhydrous ammonia system.  This includes chemicals, equipment,\r\ntechnology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. \r\nAll changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be\r\napproved through the Management of Change procedure.  This helps to ensure that inadvertent\r\nconsequences of changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected\r\nprocess safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n4.1.7  Pre-startup Safety Review\r\n\r\nSafety"
