To meet this commitment, we have\n\nestablished systems to ensure safe operation of plant processes, which includes the safe and proper\n\nhandling of hazardous substances at the plant.  One component of these systems is a Risk\n\nManagement Program (RMP), which manages the risks involved with using hazardous substances. \n\nWateree Station's RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's\n\n(EPA's) regulation 40 CFR  68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management\n\nPrograms.  This regulation is also referred to as \"the RMP rule\".  One of the requirements of the\n\nRMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing\n\nthe RMP at the Wateree Station.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary\n\nrequirement of the RMP rule and to provide a description of the RMP.  \n\n\n\nThe Wateree Station is the largest fossil plant in SCE&G system.  The plant generates 700\n\nmegawatts of electricity by burning pulverized coal in two identical generation units.  Wateree\n\nStation's Unit 1 began commercial operation in 1970, and Unit 2 began operation in 1971.  To\n\ncomply with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, SCE&G must reduce 85% of the total Nitrogen\n\nOxides (NOx) emitted system-wide by May, 2004.  After exhaustive studies, SCE&G determined\n\nthat Wateree Station would install a Selective Catalytic Reduction Reactor (SCR) for each of\n\nWateree Station's generating units.  Inside each SCR, anhydrous ammon"

Design engineering\n\nindicated the need to install two 60,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks to support\n\noperation of the SCRs.  Operation of the SCRs will be year round.\n\n\n\nThe Wateree Station Risk Management Program consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n  1. A hazard assessment to identify (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental\n\n  releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the\n\n  substances regulated by the RMP rule (see Sections 3 and 5 of this executive summary);\n\n  \n\n  2.

An emergency response program to provide guidance to the plant for responding to accidental\n\n  releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule (see Section 6 of this\n\n  executive summary).\n\n\n\nAlthough the RMPlan helps ensure that Wateree Station's RMP covered system is maintained and\n\noperated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the plant's overall safety program.

In the unlikely event of a release, employees are trained to recognize accidental\n\nreleases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release. \n\nCoordination with the county's Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) is crucial to protect\n\nthe health and safety of the surrounding community.  Emergency planning efforts have been\n\nperformed with Richland County Emergency Services, and SCE&G will continue to work closely\n\nwith them.  In addition, the LEPCs for the adjacent communities (Sumter County and Calhoun\n\nCounty) have been informed.  In short, actions have been taken to ensure appropriate plans are in\n\nplace to minimize the impact of a release on our employees and the community.\n\n\n\n\nThe SCE&G safety program consists of a number of elements, many of which are beyond what is\n\nrequired by the RMP rule.

A multidisciplinary team was assembled to analyze the\n\nhazards of the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling process.
