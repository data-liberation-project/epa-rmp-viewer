Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) facilities chlorine handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  \n\n\n\nThe LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant facilities complex consists of four different chlorination stations and one chemical depot: (1) the LAAFP facility; (2)  the Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station (LAROCS); (3) the Van Norman Chemical Depot (VNCD); (4) the Van Norman Chloramination Station # 1 (VNCS#1); and (5) the Van Norman Chloramination Station #2 (VNCS#2). The LADWP prepared and submitted the RMP for the above five chlorination stations in June 2014. Subsequent to the submission of the RMP in June 2014, the LADWP decided to make significant process changes at the LA Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station. These changes included the installation of new (upgraded technology) chlorinators and a dry media"

This scrubber will neutralize any chlorine release from the pressure safety valve (PSV) installed on the chlorine bulk storage tank as well as from a ton container. It may be noted that prior to the installation of the main scrubber, any chlorine release from the bulk tank PSV was vented outside the chlorine storage room.\n\n\n\nThe LADWP made modifications in two parts (temporary modification and full upgrade) to facilitate the continued chlorination system operation during the replacement of chlorinators and the installation of the chlorine main dry scrubber. The temporary modification allowed station to run uninterrupted, per water quality regulations during upgrades to the LAROCS. The temporary modification was completed in January 2015. The full upgrade of the facility was completed in January 2016, and the upgraded LAROCS is now in operation. \n\n\n\nThe LADWP prepared Program Level 3 RMP in June 2015 because the LAAFP processes are subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. This 2016 RMP is an update of the June 2015 RMP and includes updated information for the LAROCS process. The July 2016 RMP also demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n\n\n?

All applicable requirements of the State of California and the EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and the CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The LAAFP facilities have an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\n\n\nThe five LAAFP processes are located in the same complex adjacent to the Los Angeles Reservoir in Sylmar, California.

In the event an accidental release that could result in offsite consequences occurs, external resources, such as the City of Los Angeles Fire Department will also be solicited to respond.  \n\n\n\nAs part of the emergency response program, the LADWP has developed and implemented an emergency response plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment. The following elements are included:\n\n\n\n(a)    An emergency response plan is maintained at each facility, including the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) containing:\n\n?    Organizational structure (chain-of-command) and responsibilities of various LADWP personnel.\n\n?    Procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations.\n\n?    Details of the training programs for all employees involved with the chlorination process, contractor training, and medical surveillance of LADWP personnel who respond to chlorine releases.\n\n?    Details of emergency recognition and prevention at the LADWP.\n\n?    Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.\n\n?    Documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures and the detailed information on emergency health care.\n\n?    Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release.\n\n(b)    Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance. \n\n(c)    Training in relevant procedures for all employees inv"

      "SummaryText": "olved with the chlorination process.\n\n(d)    Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs part of updating the 2009 Risk Management Program, PHAs were performed in 2014 for the LAAFP, VNCD, LAROCS, VNCS#1, and VNCS#2 chlorination systems. Based on 2014 PHAs, additional recommendations were made to improve chlorine safety. All the above recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the LADWP. Subsequent to the submission of the RMP in June 2014, the LADWP decided to make significant process changes at the LA Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station. These changes included the installation of new chlorinators and a dry media chlorine main scrubber of one-ton capacity. This scrubber will essentially neutralize any chlorine release from the PSV installed on the chlorine bulk storage tank. It may be noted that prior to the installation of the main scrubber, any chlorine release from the bulk tank PSV was vented outside the chlorine storage room. The LADWP made modifications in two parts [temporary modification and full upgrade (upgrade)] to facilitate the continued chlorination system operation during the replacement of chlorinators and the installation of the chlorine main dry scrubber. The temporary modification to the LAROCS was completed in January 2015. The final upgrade of the facility was completed in January 2016. The final upgraded facility is now in operation.\n\n\n\nPHA for the LAROCS was again performed in March 2016 after the final upgrade of the LAROCS was completed. No additional recommendations were made during the March 2016 PHA. Based on the 2016 seismic assessment (walkthroughs and engineering reviews) for the final upgraded LAROCS, three additional recommendations were made. All of these three recommendations have been evaluated and implemented. \n\n"
