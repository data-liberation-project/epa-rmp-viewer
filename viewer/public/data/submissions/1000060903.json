This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained refrigeration personnel are coordinate with the Miami County Local Emergency Planning Committee which provides emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled our facility's primary activities revolve around the storage and distribution of products to many retail outlets. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility. The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. To evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC. Information pertaining to the off-site consequences is located within the Risk Management Program at our facility.\r\n\r\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.
