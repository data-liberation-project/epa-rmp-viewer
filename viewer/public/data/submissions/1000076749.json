The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of MFA Agri Service St. Joseph are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Buchanan County LEPC and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an anhydrous ammonia storage facility and sells the regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\n\n\n3.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program for the location consists of following the provisions of:\n\n\n\na.    40 CFR Part 68\n\nb.    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111\n\nc.    Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law\n\nd.    CGA G.2.1 - 2014\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nAn accident occurred on March 24, 2014 when an employee was in the process of disconnecting the hose end valve on a transfer hose after filling a nurse tank. In the process of bleeding the connection, the employee failed to allow the pressure to bleed completely at the transfer connection point.  \n\n\n\nOther than the accident listed above, there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has;\n\n\n\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\nb. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency planning and community\n\n   right-to-know informa"
