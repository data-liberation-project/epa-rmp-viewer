The Facility Policy\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Trenton are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Trenton Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of grain, seed, feed, and farm supplies.  This facility also distributes anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks filled at Tindall, brought to Trenton and parked there for pickup by farmers. The facility also handles pesticides, grain, feed, and farm supply products.\n\nNo product is handled or transferred at this facility.  During the spring and late fall application season up to 15 nurse tanks could be parked in the lot south of the main building.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will adopt changes required to\nmeet the 1999 ANSI Code as budgets and time will allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.
