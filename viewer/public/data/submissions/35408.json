BOX 2047\nOMAHA, NE. 68103-2047\n\nAGP\nAGP GRAIN COOPERATIVE\nROSEMONT BRANCH\nRR. 2 BOX 132\nBLUE HILL, NE. 68930\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stores on our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local fire company, Emergency Response Personnel and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \u00bfEstablishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal gain elevators\u00bf, however we are also engaged in providing \u00bfagricultural inputs\u00bf that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing and reloading is 493130 \u00bfFarm Product Warehousing and Storage\u00bf.  We include all crop protection and petroleum products in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be include in this report. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the spring months.  Anhydrous ammonia may also be applied in the fall during some years.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The Boone County LEPC and the local response agencies have been informed of the maximum quantities that may be on site at any given time. \n\nThe facility is operated on an \u00bfas needed\u00bf basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \u00bffull time employee\u00bf"

      "SummaryText": "on site, therefore, item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our facilities have adequate light and are inspected at various times of the day and night throughout the year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario:\n\nThe \u00bfWorst Case Release Scenario\u00bf is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest anhydrous ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released is based on 85% of the capacity of the largest vessel on site as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles is based on the EPA\u00bfs RMP-Comp Program (version 1.07).  Possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in planning for emergencies. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of anhydrous ammonia during the last 5 years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual and self-closing excess flow valves, so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is rounded to 0.1 mile per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00bf; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CRF 1910.111 \u00bfStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00bf.  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of anhydrous ammonia and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to:  Excess flow valves at rises; barriers to avoid damage by t"
