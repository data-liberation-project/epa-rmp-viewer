Lilly is also thoroughly prepared to respond to accidents and other incidents with fully trained response teams.\n\nTippecanoe Laboratories plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nTippecanoe Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighborhood groups.  These panels provide feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors. \n\n2.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Phosgene\n\nTippecanoe Labs uses phosgene as a raw material in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  This worst-case release scenario involves the release of the entire contents of a reactor containing 190 pounds of phosgene in solution in ten minutes.  According to the EPA's RMP Comp program, using EPA's standard weather conditions, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 5.0 miles.  Approximately 56,000 residents may be affected by this release. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemical - Ethyl Ether\n\nTippecanoe Labs uses ethyl ether as a solvent in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  This worst-case release scenario involves the entire contents of the tank (44,000 pounds) vaporizing, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the EPA's RMP Comp program, using an endpoint distance of an overpressure of 1 psi., the flammable endpoint is 0.3 miles.
