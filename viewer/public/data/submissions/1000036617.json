This amount corresponds to 3.0 parts per million by volume.\r\n\r\nThe Borough of Hanover Municipal Water Works Filter Plant Accidental Release Prevention Program is based upon the following elements:\r\n1.\tRoutine training for the operators;\r\n2.\tPreventative maintenance program for equipment;\r\n3.\tUse of industry-standard process and safety equipment;\r\n4.\tUse of effective standard operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators;\r\n5.\tPerformance of a Hazard Review of the equipment and procedures; and\r\n6.\tImplementation of an auditing and inspection program.\r\n\r\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chlorine gas detector connected to an alarm and telephone dialer.\r\n\r\nBased on available information, there has not been an accidental release of chlorine in more than 35 years.  Therefore, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine within the 5 year review period.\r\n\r\nThe facility has an emergency response program that has been reviewed and coordinated by the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  The operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated on an annual basis by the Adams County LEPC.  The Adams County Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) team is the designated first-responder in the event of a chlorine leak incident.  The Adams County HAZMAT team is trained only at the Technician Level and, therefore, is not state certified; however, they can provide limited support for chlorine leak containment."

      "SummaryText": "The Borough of Hanover Municipal Authority owns a potable water treatment and distribution system for the Borough of Hanover and some surrounding communities, located in York and Adams Counties, Pennsylvania.  This system is operated by the Borough of Hanover.  The Hanover Municipal Water Works Filter Plant, located at 235 Old Hanover Road, processes up to 11 million gallons per day of water drawn from the South Branch Conewego Creek to yield potable water.  Treatment processes at the Plant include pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, fluoridation, and chlorine disinfection.  Chemical addition is utilized to control taste, odor, and corrosion.  The Plant is typically operated 24 hours per day, Monday through Saturday, with 8-hour coverage on Sundays and major holidays.\r\n\r\nThe Water Works Filter Plant includes a Chlorination Room, which contains four (4) one ton cylinders of chlorine liquefied under pressure, chlorinators, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  The chlorinator system uses remote vacuum actuated feed lines and has high pressure regulators attached directly to the chlorine vessel gas valves to mitigate high pressure gas releases through the chlorinator system.  Water treatment operators regularly check the room and its equipment, inventory the rate of chlorine use, and adjust the rate as necessary.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine gas for planning purposes is 8,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using the RMP*Comp program distributed by the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  This model determines the distance traveled by chlorine released until its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per Liter (mg/L).  The chlorine toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L in air represents the American Industrial"

The York County HAZMAT team is state certified and undergoes extensive training in dealing with a variety of hazardous material incidents, including chlorine gas leaks.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRecommendations to improve safety were made following a June 25, 2013 inspection of the disinfection system by the Borough's Consulting Engineer.  These recommendations include improvements to written emergency standard operating procedures (SOPs) and development of an operator training program that provides annual refresher training on proper safety and handling of chlorine, as well as chlorine leak response procedures."
