      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is Carpenter Co.s policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which the facility handles TDI, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures used, and the training of its personnel.\n\nCarpenter Co. - Russellville Division has a corporate health and safety policy, environmental policy, and work procedures in place to prevent accidents and release from happening.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCarpenter Co. - Russellville Division is located at 200 Forrest Park Drive, Russellville, KY, and manufactures various types of polyurethane foam padding products, including foam-cushioning products for furniture, carpet padding and similar uses.  The RMP regulations cover the unspecified isomer toluene diisocyanate (TDI) process at their facility.\n\nAn evaluation of the chemical usage, accident history, and worst-case release scenario at the Russellville Division indicates that Program 2 requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) apply to this plant.  The Russellville Division has the potential to maintain up to 3,438,179 pounds of TDI, CAS Number 26417-62-5, at the plant at one time.  This is in excess of the threshold value for RMP applicability.  The threshold value for TDI is 10,000 pounds.  The Russellville Division maintains no other regulated substances above the threshold value for RMP applicability.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - The worst-case release scenario would be the loss of the entire contents of a railcar of TDI forming a \"liquid release\" over a period of one hour.  There is passive mitigation for this area and the surface area of the \"liquid release\" would be 30,000 sq. feet containing 195,00"

      "SummaryText": "0 pounds of TDI.  The plant does have passive mitigation in place, however, 72,000 pounds of TDI would be released into the atmosphere.  Additionally, TDI is heated to 120\u00c2\u00b0 F to facilitate pumping.  This is based on using Equation 3-11 from RMP Guidance for OCA.  Without the current mitigation systems in place the release of TDI to the atmosphere would be much greater.  The distance to the end point for the worst case scenario is 765 feet or 0.145 miles.  However, this scenario is highly unlikely, due to regular inspections, proper training of personnel, and past historical data and is reported here only as required by provisions of the RMP regulations.  A much more realistic scenario is presented as the alternative release scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - The alternative release scenario chosed is based on a hose coming loose during the transfer of TDI to the storage tanks.  This is is most likely to happen during the unloading of a tank truck.  Procedure requires an attendant be present at all times during the unloading of TDI.  Should the hose become loose, the attendant would be able to stop the flow in 10 - 15 seconds.  This would release about 10 gallons or 100 lbs.  The puddle would cover 100 feet or 0.019 miles.  However, the area that trucks are unloaded is a containment area that will hold approximately 12,000 gallons of material.  This would place the impact zone on the property of Carpenter Co. - Russellville Division and there would be no public or environmental receptors impacted.  \n\nIn making it's calculations, the temperature utilized by the Russellville Division was 120\u00c2\u00b0 F.  This was determind by using Equation 3-11 from RMP Guidance for OCA.  Also, urban topography was used.  \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Russellville Division has in place a prevention program encompassing elements consistent with the US EPA Clean Air Act 112(r) (7) Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk"
