In 1988 the pressure feed system was replaced from a pressure system to a vacumm system. Also at this time, a chlorine leak detector and alarm system was installed.  Consulting engineers were Floan-Sanders Engineering of East Grand Forks, Minnesota.  Equipment supplier for this conversion was Feed-Rite Chemicals out of Fargo, North Dakota.  General contractor of the project was Smith Construction of Grand Forks, North Dakota. Presently, a chlorine scrubber has been authorized for construction April 6th, 1999.  This project was delayed due to the severe flooding of 1997.  Project engineers are Floan-Sanders, Inc. of East Grand Forks, Minnesota and Advanced Engineering of Grand Forks, North Dakota.  General Contractor will be Carlson Builders of Grand Forks, North Dakota.  Anticipated completion of the project is early fall of 1999.",
