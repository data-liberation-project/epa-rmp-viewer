Facility has an impeccable safety rating.  This business was consolidated into a large corporation on May 29,  1999, United Agri Products. Facility is managed by well trained and experienced personnel.  Current management recogonizes the threat to the community should a catastrophic release occur. This facility has demonstrated for 25 years that Anhydrous Ammonia can be stored and handled successfully. Maintenance and operational training are key to operating a safe facility.  Safe guards are in place to protect the facility from accidental release.  Local enforcement works closely with this facility to protect against vandalism or theft.  The facility emergency action plan is updated and enforced and distributed to local agencies who are in position to alert the community of a facility upset.  An inspection by Air Toxic - Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, September 21, 2001 found the facility completely in compliance and following the RMP plan.  \n(2)    Primary Activity is distribution of crop inputs to local farming community. Facilty supplies agriculture products directly to local farmers, who use ag products to produce food and fiber for our nation.  Our goal is to minimize the storage of large quantities of very dangerous inventory and especially concentrate on low inventories for Anhydrous Ammonia. We have limited our fill program to one truck load per year and at the end of the season, our goal is to have the storage tanks at minimum capacity, near empty during the non-planting season.   In addiition our Emergency Response Plan has been distributed to local authorities, Fire Department, LEPC for Sharkey County, local police and county sheriff departartment.  This comprehensive plan has procedures incorporated so our employees as well as ot"

      "SummaryText": "her agencies can quickly alert the community during a release. It has been determined that 400 receptors have limited exposure in the worst case scenario of .77 miles and 129 of those receptors reside within 0.33 miles of the impact zone. The total populaiton inside the .77 mile zone is limited to an estimated 400 persons. Total population of the community of Rolling Fork, MS is 2, 444 of which 2044 live outside the .77 mile zone. \n(3)   Worst Case Release Scenerio \n       Worst case, the release would be both tanks being at full capacity which is calculated at 56078 pounds liquid anhydrous ammonia.  Maximum off site concentrations are associated with a dense vapor/NH3 plume, which lingers at ground level and travels downwind.  Though highly unlikely, total release could allow the entire 56078 pounds of product to enter the atmosphere as an ammonium vapor cloud over a ten minute period. Temperture and humidity are key to severity of release impact.  Cold tempertures would restrict conversion of NH3 to vapor.  Water producing storms at the time of release would be favorable to natural mitigation of injury by absorbing NH3 vapor carried by gravity to the soil surface.  Hot tempertures and prevailing winds would enhance evaporation of liquid Anyhdrous Ammonia to become a large NH3 vapor cloud that  may travel the predicted distance of .77 miles. With these conditions, we expect the vapor to rise rather than follow the soil surface.  Utilizing acceptable scientific data tables, this facility assumes that a total release of NH3 will become a gas or entrianed in gas vapor.  Tables indicate the vapor mass would be diluted to a safe 200 parts per million in air within the predicated .77 miles, or 4,481.4 feet from the release point. This data is associated with EPA direction of using wind speed at 3 miles per hour and D stability Atmosphere.  Impact area with 400 population receptors in 0.77 miles and 129 population receptors in 0.33 miles zone can be expected. With prevail"

      "SummaryText": "ing winds, the impact zone will be down wind and it is estimated that 129 receptor population may be at risk.\n(4)     Alternative Worst Case Senerio:\n        The alternative worst case Is based upon the weak link in the system, plumbing and transfer hose.  Because the facility utilizes DOT transport vehicles to recharge the inventory, the hose which links the transport truck to the stationary storage system is the weak link. Charts developed by experts has determined that certain size hose or pipe during transfer will release product at a predictable rate. The transfer hose and pipe are known to be one and one-half inches in diameter (1-1/2 ID).  The alternative worst case release senerio, is assuming the transfer hose or pipe ruptured and full release for  2-minutes occur. If true, then expect 7, 127 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to be released. The impact zone at  0.33 mile radius from the release point would likely have greater than  200 ppm of ammonia in air. Stated otherwise, 1,920.6 feet in any direction from the release point, with a 3 mph wind and D stability weather, inside a 0.33 mile zone, with 129 population receptors having some impact above 200 ppm with no environmental receptors being totally destroyed.  The impact is predicted to be minimal at 200 ppm  ammonia in air  in .77 miles from the point of release.\n\nPeriodic evaluation of the operation, a good maintenance program along with trained operators should show continued success of operating this facility without incident as demonstated for the past 25 years.   Beyond this, we are prepared to respond to an incident with trained personnel and mitigate any circumstances quickly, and efficiently  as expected of us by our neighbors, friends, business associates and regulatory agencies."
