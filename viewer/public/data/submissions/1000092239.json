The WTP stores and uses chlorine for the sterilization process.  One-ton cylinders of chlorine are stored on site with a maximum inventory of 3 cylinders or 6,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nChlorine is stored at ambient temperatures as liquid under pressure of 90-160 psi.  Although stored as a liquid, chlorine will vaporize upon release to the atmosphere, making the release of the chemical in the gaseous state the greatest risk.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nAs an additional source of reference in the event of a release, the City of Jamestown WTP has developed the Chemical Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) according to OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n\n\nCritical to preventing a release is continual employee training in handling the chemicals both in bulk and process quantities, in the specific hazards and properties of each chemical, and the proper operation of chemical process and processing equipment.  This includes ensuring that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers.\n\n\n\nAlso necessary is adherence to a preventative maintenance program including regular equipment inspection and repair of all process and safety equipment.   \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nNo accidents have occurred at this site in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Jamestown WTP and Fire Department have coordinated in the preparation of emergency response procedures.  In the event of a catastrophic release of chlorine, the water treatment plant employees will evacuate the premises.  The Jamestown Fire Department will be immediately notified of the release.
