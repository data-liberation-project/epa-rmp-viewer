              "Description": "Hydrocracker\nBasic Process Description\nThe Hydrocracker takes gas oil, a low value fuel oil produced in the Crude and Vacuum Units, mixes it with hydrogen under high pressure (1500 psig) and temperature.  And sends it through a catalytic reactor that converts it into jet fuel, naphtha, gasoline, LPG, and fuel gas.  The naphtha, also called heavy hydrocrackate or HHC, is sent to the Reformer Unit for further processing.  The LPG and fuel gases contain high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide.  They are sent to the Amine Unit for hydrogen sulfide removal.\n\nInspections\nAll process units (including the Hydrocracker) were involved in a major plant turnaround in May 1999.  This is a time in which normally operating processes are shut down for maintenance and inspections (except the tank farm).  Because all process vessels were inspected during a two-week period the date of May 10th was used as the date of last inspection \n\nOngoing management \nThe ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements.  Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which requires modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review.  Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets).  Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.",

              "Description": "Sulfur Recovery Unit\nAlthough this process does not hold enough toxic or flammable material to meet the definition of a covered process under RMP we have included it in this plan to be consistent with our PSM program.\n\nBasic Process Description \nThe Sulfur Recovery Unit or SRU converts hydrogen sulfide that is removed in other refining processes into elemental sulfur.  The sulfur is stored in molten form at about 240 degrees F. in a concrete pit.  When the pit is full, the sulfur is transferred out into a large plywood form in where it cools and solidifies.\n\nInspections\nAll process units (including the SRU) were involved in a major plant turnaround in May 1999. This is a time in which normally operating processes are shut down for maintenance and inspections (except the tank farm).  Because all process vessels were inspected during a two-week period the date of May 10th was used as the date of last inspection.\n\nOngoing management \nThe ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements.  Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which requires modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review.  Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets).  Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.",

Through the process of distillation, pentane (gasoline) and normal butane is removed from the rest of the LPG.

The rest of the LPG is sent to the LPG for further separation.\n\nInspections\nAll process units (including the Deisobutanizer) were involved in a major plant turnaround in May 1999.

The absorption is accomplished in special scrubbing towers located at the southwest corner of the Hydrocracker.  The scrubbed LPG is sent to the DIB Unit for further processing.  The scrubbed fuel gas is piped to the refinery fuel gas system where it is burned in the process heaters and boilers.  The Hydrogen sulfide rich amine is sent to the Amine Regeneration section of the process.  In this section, the hydrogen sulfide is stripped out of the amine and sent to the Sulfur Recovery Unit.  The regenerated amine is cooled and circulated back to through the scrubbers.\n\nInspections\nAll process units (including the SRU) were involved in a major plant turnaround in May 1999. This is a time in which normally operating processes are shut down for maintenance and inspections (except the tank farm).  Because all process vessels were inspected during a two-week period the date of May 10th was used as the date of last inspection.\n\nOngoing management \nThe ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements.  Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which requires modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review.  Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets).  Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.",

              "Description": "Sour Water Unit\nAlthough this process does not hold enough toxic or flammable material to meet the definition of a covered process under RMP we have included it in this plan to be consistent with our PSM program.\n\nBasic Process Description\nWater is injected into the Hydrocracker at a certain point in the process to remove ammonia that is produced as a by-product.  This water also becomes saturated with hydrogen sulfide.  The water is sent to the Sour Water Stripper where steam is used to strip the two gases out before sending the clean water to the sewer system.  The hydrogen sulfide and ammonia are sent to the Sulfur Recovery Unit for processing.\n\nInspections\nAll process units (including the sour water unit) were involved in a major plant turnaround in May 1999. This is a time in which normally operating processes are shut down for maintenance and inspections (except the tank farm).  Because all process vessels were inspected during a two-week period the date of May 10th was used as the date of last inspection.\n\nOngoing management \nThe ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements.  Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which requires modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review.  Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets).  Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.",

This unit takes the oil and heats it to over 700 degrees F. and injects it into a tower where, through distillation, products such as diesel and jet fuel are produced.  Also distilled out of the crude oil is a heavier oil called gas oil which is sent to the Hydrocracker for further processing.\n\nNaphtha and light straight run gasoline are produced as feed stocks for the Reformer and PRIP Units.\n\nLPG, or liquefied petroleum gas, is also distilled out of the crude oil.  This is processed in the Amine Unit to remove hydrogen sulfide from it  and then sent on to the DIB and LPG units, which separates the LPG into propane and butane.\n\nPetroleum gases that are produced from the crude oil are sent to the Amine Unit for hydrogen sulfide removal and then used as fuel gas for the refinery heaters and boilers.\n\nAfter distilling all of these products from the crude oil, the residue is removed from the bottom of the distillation tower and sent to the Vacuum Unit for further processing.\n\nInspections\nAll process units (including the crude unit) were involved in a major plant turnaround in May 1999. This is a time in which normally operating processes are shut down for maintenance and inspections (except the tank farm).  Because all process vessels were inspected during a two-week period the date of May 10th was used as the date of last inspection.\n\nOngoing management \nThe ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements.

              "Description": "Reformer\nBasic Process Description\nThe Reformer takes naphtha produced in the Crude Unit and Hydrocracker and, using a catalyst, converts it into a high-octane gasoline component called reformate.  The unit also produces hydrogen and LPG as by-products.  The hydrogen is piped to the Hydrocracker and Hydrogen Unit; the LPG is sent to the DIB and LPG Units for separation into propane and butane.\n\nInspections\nAll process units (including the reformer) were involved in a major plant turnaround in May 1999. This is a time in which normally operating processes are shut down for maintenance and inspections (except the tank farm).  Because all process vessels were inspected during a two-week period the date of May 10th was used as the date of last inspection.\n\nOngoing management \nThe ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements.  Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which requires modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review.  Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets).  Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.",

              "Description": "Partial Recycle Isomerization Process (P.R.I.P.)\nBasic Process Description\nThis process takes the light straight run gasoline produced in the Crude Unit and, through a reaction process, converts into a higher octane gasoline component called isomerate.   Hydrogen from the Hydrogen Unit is used in this process.  A small amount of LPG is also produced as a by-product.\n\nInspections\nAll process units (including the PRIP unit) were involved in a major plant turnaround in May 1999. This is a time in which normally operating processes are shut down for maintenance and inspections (except the tank farm).  Because all process vessels were inspected during a two-week period the date of May 10th was used as the date of last inspection.\n\nOngoing management \nThe ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements.  Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which requires modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review.  Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets).  Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.",

Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which requires modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review.  Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets).

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Kenai refinery, located in Nikiski, Alaska, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and gasoline) from raw crude oil.  The refinery uses or produces several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion involving the maximum inventory of the largest storage tank containing flammable substances.  If such a massive release were to occur, much of the material would disperse away from the site before the flammable cloud found an ignition source.  However, we assume that the entire amount stays within the flammable cloud, thus ensuring that the estimated impact is worse than would actually occur.  The maximum tank inventory of 3.4 million lb. is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) .  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this scenario is 1.2 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive or active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe alternative scenario for"

Although such events are extremely rare, they can occur when a fire impinges on a tank long enough to weaken the vessel.  When such an explosion does occur, a large fireball can often rise for several hundred feet above the storage tank.  For this vessel, the potential fireball could cause second degree burns up to 0.11 miles (560 feet) from the vessel and create a 1 psi overpressure up to .4 miles.  Tesoro has never experienced a release of this magnitude.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAt Tesoro we are proud of our safety performance.  The Kenai refinery has had an excellent record of accident prevention since the start of our operation in 1969.  In fact, we have never experienced an incident that impacted people or property outside of the refinery since 1969.  One reason for our success at preventing accidents is that we investigate even minor incidents promptly and thoroughly to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  Thus, we can eliminate many incidents before they become problems.  \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Kenai refinery.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Kenai refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Refinery Safety Program.  Regularly held safety meetings in each department are one way in which employee's are able to participate in the review and development of programs and work practices.  Other specific ways that employees can be involved in the Refinery Safety Program are documented in an employee participation pl"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The refinery has developed procedures for operating the process within safe limits for  temperature, level, composition, etc.  In addition the refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Kenai refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards"

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed and resolved by local management.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Kenai refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Kenai refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as  unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial sta"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the Kenai refinery provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit variances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators as electronic files on PC's located in the control rooms and in hard copy (emergency procedures only).\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Kenai refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process related duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. Before operating in a process operators must be certified by demonstrating skill and knowledge of in that specific process.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted routinely with the maximum time frame to be at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nThe Kenai refinery uses contractors to suppl"

Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThe Kenai refinery conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.
