      "SummaryText": "The United Suppliers, Inc. - Hastings, NE operation is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving both practices and measures to prevent the release of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, the Hastings facility has an emergency action plan to minimize both on- and off-site effects.\n\nThe Hastings facility's activities include the wholesale shipping of anhydrous ammonia.  This activity involves receiving ammonia railcars, unloading railcars into ammonia storage tanks (6), and the transfer of ammonia to customer tanker-trucks.  These operations are covered by OSHA's Process Safety Standard.  A secondary activity is the periodic production of a fluid fertilizer, using a portable reactor.  The portable reactor is brought on-site via truck and connected to ammonia supply from the facility's storage tanks.  Ammonia and phosphoric acid are reacted to produce a non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solution for wholesale distribution.  The reactor operation is contracted with others and covered by a separate PSM (owned by the contract organization).  The operation and maintenance procedures for the portable reactor operation reside with the contract organization.  The Emergency Response Procedures for the Hastings site and contracted organization are integrated into one response, prior to operation of the portable reactor.\n\nUnited Suppliers, Inc. - Hastings, NE has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The following briefly describes the prevention program elements in place at this stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The facility maintains information describing the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Studies are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with process operations are identified, understood and controlled.\n\nO"

These procedures address the following activities:   initial startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround.\n\nTraining:  A program is in place to ensure employees are knowledgeable and trained in procedures associated with the covered processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity:  Covered process equipment is maintained consistent with generally accepted engineering practices.  Covered process equipment is routinely inspected and tested.  Covered process equipment viability assessments include:  storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance activites are conducted by qualified personnel.  Deficiencies are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:  Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or procedures.  Affected personnel are informed and trained to deal with authorized system changes.\n\nPre-Startup Review:  Technical and operational reviews are conducted on new processes and/or modifications to existing covered processes.  Reviews confirm the construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable.  Reviews are completed prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Internal audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions specified under the RMP rule are being implemented.  At a minimum, these audits are conducted every three (3) years.  Any determined corrective actions are completed in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigations:  Investigations are conducted to determine the root cause of covered process incidents.  In addition to determination and correction, investigations are directed toward preventing reoccurence.  Investigations become process safety information and are retained for five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation:"

Additionally, employees have access to all information pertaining to the facility's RMP.\n\nContractors:  Periodically, Hastings hires contractors to conduct specialized operational, maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to work, contractors are trained on the covered processes, relevant process safety information and emergency response actions.\n\nFive (5) Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage.  Nor to our knowledge, has there been any releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage and/or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Action Plan:  United Suppliers, Inc. - Hastings, NE has a written emergency action plan.  This plan includes notification of the Adams County LEPC and the Nebraska Emergency Response Center.  Local authorities have been provided with emergency planning and community right-to-know information.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  United Suppliers, Inc. - Hastings, NE views safety improvement as a continual process.  Periodic evaluations (both internal and external) are performed to assess the facility status.  At this time, and aside from sustaining maintenance activities, there are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding anhydrous ammonia."
