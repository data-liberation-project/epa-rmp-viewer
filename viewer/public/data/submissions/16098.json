      "SummaryText": "Redi-Serve Foods manufactures prepared meat products, primarily frozen on-site an distributed nation-wide.  This building contains a mechanical refrigeration system, fueled by anhydrous ammonia.  With a capacity of 36,000 pounds.  The facility is located in a rural industrial park in southwestern Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin. No reportable accidents have occured within the anhydrous ammonia system for greater than a five year period from date of this report.  In support of the EPA Clean Air Act Redi-Serve Foods has completed both a worst case scenario and alernate case scenario for catastrophic events.  The worst case consisted of a breach in containment of the high pressure receiver emitting 11,866 pounds of ammonia at a rate of 2,680 pounds per minute for a 10 minute period.  This produced a maximum LOC for 2.3 miles.  The alternate case scenario consisted of a relief valve release for one hour releaseing 2,197 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at a rate of 112 ounds per minute.  This allowed for a LOC of 1681 yards.  The Safety efforts at the facility are supported by a sensing alarm system of the engine room to detect anhydous ammonia.  The OSHA Process Safety Management program coupled with the emergency response plan are the corner stone of the safety support programs surrounding the safe use of ammonia.  The Jefferson LEPC, local police, fire, and medical personal are kept abreast of the ammonia at Red-Serve and the community services interaction at the facility."
