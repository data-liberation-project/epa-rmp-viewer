To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods BLOUNTSVILLE, AL., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods BLOUNTSVILLE, AL., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n     AT BLOUNTSVILLE, AL. WE USE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR OUR REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n     THE MAXIMUM INVENTORY IS 95,000LBS. SPLIT BETWEEN TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS.  THERE IS     ALSO A 30,000 GALLON PROPANE GAS TANK.         \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n\n Worst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing 30,000  pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of 30,000 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 3.1 before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \nWorst-case scenario ii.  Rupture of propane storage tank releasing 105,000lbs with a distance to 1 PSI of .38 miles.\nAlternative release scenario i. - An upset condition"

The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system is equipped with high pressure cutouts that help to prevent releases of this nature.  Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required. This facility has had 1 releases in the past 5 years of this type.\nAlternative release scenario ii.  A pull-away during refueling of propane tank  causing a failure of a 25 foot length of 4 inch hose.  The excess flow valve functions to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose is released.  The resulting unconfined vapor travels to the lower flamability limit.  The distance to the lower flamability limit is less than 320 feet.\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems \tTyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators.  \n \n5.  Five-year accident history.\n    AT 10:00AM ON 9/7/95 A SAFETY RELIEF VALVE ON THE CONDENSER FAILED OPEN, RESULTING IN A  RELEASE THAT WAS CALCULATED TO BE A MAXIMUM QTY. OF 900LBS.. THE RELIEF VALVE WAS\nISOLATED, THE VALVE WAS REPLACED, THE VALVE LEAK TESTED AND THEN THE CONDENSER WAS\nPUT BACK INTO SERVICE. \n   THE RELEASE RESULTED IN NO INJURIES OR REPORTED PROPERTY DAMAGE.\n\n6.   The emergency response program.\t\nA fully trained and equiped Emergency Response Team is on site.  This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q)."
