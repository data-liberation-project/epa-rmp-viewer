      "SummaryText": "Pine Lake Corn Processors, LLLP (PLCP) is an ethanol fuel production plant located in Steamboat Rock, Iowa in Hardin County. PLCP has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that could exceed reporting thresholds as a requirement of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  PLCP began operations in 2005.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nPLCP is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. PLCP uses natural gasoline as a denaturant to make ethanol produced at the facility unfit for human consumption. PLCP also uses aqueous ammonia for pH control directly in the process. In the event of a significant emergency, including an accidental release of flammable or toxic materials, it is the policy of PLCP to notify appropriate authorities and evacuate all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nAs previously mentioned, PLCP's ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (most commonly natural gasoline) to render ethanol produced by the facility unfit for human consumption. The natural gasoline is stored in an aboveground tank as a liquid under atmospheric pressure and is mixed with ethanol prior to transport. The denaturant tank is located in the facility's on-site tank farm area which is equipped with secondary containment. Denaturant used by the facility commonly contains iso-pentane, pentane, and butane in varying percentages. The maximum amount of denaturant on-site would be approximately 31,350 gallons or 180,000 pounds (approximately 64,000 pounds of which is iso-pentane, 46,000 pounds is pentane, and 15,000 pounds is butane).\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThrough completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard at 29 CFR 1910.119, PLCP has complied with the EPA requirem"

      "SummaryText": "ents at 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. A PHA for a variety of hazardous processes at the facility was conducted in February 2012. Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations. \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nPLCP does not have a history of accidents involving regulated chemcials which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nPLCP has developed response efforts to a variety of potential scenarios involving hazardous substances stored and used at the facility. These efforts have been coordinated with state and federal regulating agencies and local responders. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAs previously mentioned, PLCP is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. PLCP management is committed to promoting a safe work environment. PLCP will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support needed to conduct their work safely and to operate the ethanol production process in a safe and efficient manner."
