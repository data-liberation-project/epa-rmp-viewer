Marsh is committed to providing a safe and healthy work place for all of its employees at the Facility. This commitment is evidenced by Marsh's safety audit program and safety training requirements for employees responsible for handling the ammonia at the Facility.                                      \n\nIn addition, Marsh recognizes the importance of being a \"good neighbor\"  to the community in the vicinity of the Facility, particularly in regard to the safe handling and storage of ammonia at the Facility. Accordingly, Marsh has dedicated and intends to dedicate the necessary resources to reduce the risks associated with an accidental release of ammonia at the Facility through preparation, planning and implementation of a Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") program for the Facility. The specifics of the PSM program have been outlined in the following sections.\n\nThe accident release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility.\n\nSafety in the workplace, including the safe handling and storage of ammonia at the Facility, continues to be one of Marsh's highest priorities. Marsh is not only committed to complying with federal, state and local regulations regarding ammonia at the Facility, but also to going beyond the legal requirements with its best management practices, which includes matters such as internal auditing of safety and health matters, evaluating alternatives to reducing the amount of ammonia necessary for the Facility, and training additional employees beyond regulatory requirements. Further, Marsh is committed to implementing the PSM program"

      "SummaryText": "as described thoughout this summary.\n\nFacility and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Facility is approximately 193,000 square feet in area, and sits on approximately 12.21 acres of land in Yorktown, Indiana, located in southwestern Delaware County, Indiana. The Facility is similar to a typical warehouse used to store perishable food products prior to their distribution and sale to the consumer. Due to the perishable nature of the food products stored in the Facility (i.e.dairy products, meats, fruits, vegetables, etc.), the interior temperatures of the Facility are controlled with a refrigeration system. This refrigeration system uses liquid anhydrous ammonia to keep portions of the Facility between 50 F and 28F on a continual basis. Typically, less than 10,000 pounds or 1,946 gallons of anhydrous ammonia are maintained at the site of the Facility.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is considered to be extremely hazardous under certain conditions. Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric temperature and pressure. In its gas form, ammonia is colorless, but has an intensely irritating odor and may cause eye, nose and throat irritation and breathing difficulties. If concentrations of the gas are sufficiently high, inhalation can cause respiratory tract irritation and/or death. Ammonia has a vapor density of 0.6 compared to air (1.0); consequently, the gas dissipates into the atmosphere. Although the gas will dissipate into the atmosphere, it is recommended to stay up-wind and out of low lying areas should a release of ammonia occur.\n\nWorst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s)\n\nA worst-case and alternative release scenario were calculated using RMP*Comp to determine endpoints for each scenario. The endpoints were as follows:\n          Worst-case Release Scenario = 0.4 miles\n         Alternative Release Scenario = 0.2 miles\nThe worst-case release scenario considered a release of the full 10,000 pounds to the atmosphere over a ten (10) minute duration.

      "SummaryText": "he distance of 0.4 miles calculated above constitutes an endpoint. An endpoint is considered the furthest extent of impact given the variables in the scenario. In this case, offsite public receptors (e.g., residences) would be affected by toxic concetrations from an accidental release.\n\nIt is unlikely that a worst-case release scenario would occur due to the systems and controls utilized in connection with the Facility, such as, the computer systems which continuously monitors the refrigeration system and promptly alerts the operator of any malfunctions, and 24 hour guard service at the Facility.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered a release of 1,000 pounds to the atmosphere over a 24 hour duration. As described above, a distance of 0.2 miles was calculated as the endpoint for this scenario. In this case, offsite public receptors could be affected by toxic concentrations from an accidental release of ammonia from the Facility.\n\nThis scenario was used as the alternative release scenario because it is similar to a release at the Facility in 1997. The release was considered as a \"typical\" release scenario for the facility.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nMarsh is in the process (June and July of 1999) of thoroughly reviewing all of its policies and procedures concerning the Facility's refrigeration system. Specifically, the standard operating procedures concerning the operation, maintenance and handling of anhydrous ammonia will be evaluated. It is anticipated that the final review and revisions to the PSM program will be in place by August 1, 1999.\n\nIn addition, training for all operators of the refrigeration system at the Facility will be evaluated to ensure its compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and manufacturers' specifications, as well as Marsh's best management practices.\n\nThe five-year accident history\n\nIn the past five years, the Facility has not experienced any accidents withi"

The purpose of the plan is to protect employees from serious injury, property loss or the loss of life in the event of a major disaster. The Emergency Action Plan outlines responsibilities and actions to be taken in an emergency situaiton. It descriges the in-house warning system, ammonia alarm system, evacuation procedures and emergency shutdown procedures. It also outlines employee responsibilities and emergency contact numbers.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe review of the PSM should be completed by August 1, 1999. It is believed that the review may result in improvements to operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system of the Facility, such as enhancements to its computer monitoring system and additional monitoring devices, as well as the training of additional employees with responsibility for the operation and maintenance fo the refrigeration system at the Facility."
