      "SummaryText": "Brakebush Bros Inc, located at 251 Eaton Rd, Mocksville NC is a family owned poultry processing facility that has been in operation for over 75 years. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility for processing and to provide cooling for storage rooms. Our refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between 15\" vacuum on the low side to a high side pressure of 210PSI. The Maximum amount in the system at any one time is estimated at 42,000. pounds.\n\nWorst case release scenario for a toxic substance:\nOur worse case release scenario would be a failure of the high pressure receiver in our refrigeration system. The High Pressure Receiver(HPR) measures 8'dia by 12' high with a maximum capacity of 24,364lbs. It is located outside the building, no passive mitigation was considered. Although normal operating level of this HPR is between 4,872 to 7,309lbs the worst case analysis takes into account that the HPR might be 80% full. Using the tables and equations found in chapter 4 of EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the toxic endpoint was calculated at 1.7 miles. Based on census data, within this radius is a population of 3,686, residential housing, and a few retail businesses. There are no hospitals located within this area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for a toxic substance:\nThe alternative release toxic endpoint was also determined using EPA's RMP Guidance for ammonia refrigeration reference tables and equations. A pressure relief valve failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables in RMP guidance, a ten minute release of ammonia at 140lbs/min, from the HPR relief valve would affect and area of 0.1 miles. The estimated population within distance to endpoint is 0. There is a retail business, some residents but no schools or hospitals. \n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Repsonse Policies:\nBrakebush Bros Inc has established an in house emergency response team to quickly respond t"

The facility has also established annual refresher training for all personnel that are on the Hazmat team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure the Davie County HAZMAT team to establish a joint response program. These established plans and procedures are periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nBrakebush Bros Inc, has trained selected personnel, including refrigeration operators in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response, OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine the appropriate level of response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a flange bolt of packing gland, or initiating a system shut down. Brakebush Bros has established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system and has included in those procedures the emergency shut down and isolation in the event of a release. Brakebush Bros has also purchased HAZMAT equipment consisting of; level A and B chemical suits, SCBA equipment, cartridge type gas masks with ammonia cartridges, face shields, safety glasses, rubber gloves and boots. The Hazmat team has been trained in the Incident Command Structure system and will coordinate their efforts with the Davie County HAZMAT team. \n\nFive year accident history:\nThere have been no reportable releases in the last 5 years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nBrakebush Bros has not only complied with the EPA Risk Management Program but also OSHA Process Safety Management regulations to assure that the ammonia refrigeration system is well maintained and the employees are properly trained and periodically retrained to assure that they are kept up to date on any changed and new operations that may af"
