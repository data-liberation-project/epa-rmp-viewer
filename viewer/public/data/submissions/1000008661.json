This pursuant to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulations contained in Part 68 of Code 40 of the federal regulations (40 CFR Part 68), Accidental Release Prevention regulation.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention regulation requires stationary sources with listed substances present in quantities greater than the corresponding threshold quantity to develop and implement a risk management program that includes a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  The risk management program is to be described in a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is registered with the USEPA, submitted to the state and local agencies, and made available to the public.  At General Chemical Augusta Plant, one listed chemical, Oleum, is managed on site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity.\n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with 40 CFR 68, Subpart G (68. 105-68.190), which provides a format for a written RMP.  In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.10(d)(2), the NAICS 325188 (former SIC classification 2819) requires compliance with this rule.\n\nAn updated RMP, including an off-site consequence analysis, is required within five years of the RMP's initial submission or its most recent update.  A compliance audit to certify compliance with the provisions of the RMP regulations is required every three years. \n\nA hazard assessment was completed consisting of one worst-case release scenario and one alternative case release scenario.  The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR part 68 Subpart B (68.20-68.42), as well as guidance provided by USEPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAs part of General Chemical, the Augusta Plant is committed to being a responsible member of"

      "SummaryText": " the community.  General Chemical Corporate Policy dictates that facilities minimize the potential for adverse effects to the environment as well as to the health of employees and local citizens by operating plants safely.  Methods of minimizing or reusing wastes, in addition to using energy and materials wisely are encouraged.  A key element of the General Chemical Health, Safety and Environmental Policy is fostering openness through dialogue with employees and the public.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We pay close attention to those chemicals which OSHA and the EPA identify as hazardous substances.  Our policy is to conform to all applicable laws and regulations, as well as codes and recommended practices to ensure the safety of the public and the environment.  We use accidental release prevention programs to make sure our processes are managed safely.  We also prepared for potential emergencies to protect employees and the public in the event of a chemical release.\n\nSafety is an important issue at the Augusta Plant.  Monthly meetings are held with plant employees to address environmental and safety issues.  The plant participates in a quarterly meeting with other local industry and the public to review safety issues.  The plant also has regular audits, which are conducted by internal employees and corporate audit teams.  The recommendations obtained through these audits are used to improve the environmental health and safety status at the Augusta Plant.\n\nThe Augusta Sulfuric Acid Plant is a state of the art plant, which was designed and built by Monsanto Envirochem.  The initial start-up was September 15, 1997.  A major modification to increase production while reducing overall emissions was completed in September of 2008. \n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this facility, sulfur is burned to form sulfur dioxide, which is oxidized in a catalytic converter to form sulfur trio"

Oleum is produced through the absorption of sulfur trioxide enters the Oleum tower in a counter-current flow to the circulating Oleum where it is absorbed into solution.  The product is 24%.  Oleum is transferred off-site via pipeline to a neighboring chemical company and is loaded into trucks for an external customer.  The Oleum inventory on site is 21,600,000 pounds.\n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical- Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe maintain a significant safety program to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation of our processes.  The accident prevention program implemented at Augusta Plant includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the RMP regulation including:\n\n* Process Safety Information- Information relating to the hazards of the chemical, process technology and equipment information are maintained to ensure proper operation.\n* Mechanical Integrity- Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment on site.\n* Process Hazard Analysis- Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the operating limits and safety considerations.\n* Employee Participation- Employees at all levels are involved in key rolls of the release prevention program.\n* Training- Employees in the operating process are trained in detail to ensure proper operation of the plant.\n* Management of Change- Process parameters are maintained through a management of change system which documents the changes as well as evaluates changes for safety.\n* Pre-startup Safety Review- Significant changes to the processes are evaluated in detail to verify the proper construction, operating procedures, emergency procedures and safety are addressed prior to operation.\n* Incident Investigation- All i"

According for reporting accidents, no accidents have occurred during the past five years involving the release of a chemical regulated under Risk Management program causing on-site deaths, injuries or significant property damage; or known off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelter in place.\n\nThe facility did not have an Oleum related incident during the past five years.\n\nHowever, an incident did occur at our site on November 17, 1998, which caused 46 people in the local community to seek medical at"

      "SummaryText": "tention.  No injuries were reported from plant employees.  The incident occurred during the course of start-up of our Sulfuric Acid plant when some cooling equipment was not properly engaged.  This caused the release of approximately seven pounds of Sulfur Trioxide and 78 pounds of Sulfuric Acid mist through our stack during a 10-minute period.  Both of these quantities are below the reportable quantity identified by the EPA that triggers release reporting.\n\nAs a result of this release, a complete incident investigation was performed.  This included a detailed process hazard analysis to identify the root cause of the release.  Process control methods to control future incidents were installed as a result of this release.\n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n6.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following is a list of changes, which are scheduled at the plant in the near future to improve safety:\n\n* Continue to enhance process interlocks and controls \n\n\n7.0 Certification\n\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\n\nPlant Manager                                    \n\n\n                            _______________________                                               Date\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n"
