This type of analysis applies to and is required for every hazardous (toxic & reactive) chemical listed in section 1910.119. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) shall include, but is not limited to the following items:\n\n1. The hazards of each process; both chemical and mechanical hazards should be noted.\n2. Identification/examples of previous incidents, which did, or could, have become catastrophic.\n3. The used or site available chemical detection methods. \n4. Consequences of loss of system/process control. Factors causing loss of control should include both operator and mechanical error/malfunction. \n\n\nRequirements\n\nI. Employer shall perform an initial PHA on all ammonia equipment. PHA's shall be done as soon as possible and in order of relative danger to personnel and equipment that a failure would cause (Required schedule is 100% complete by May 26, 1994).\nII. The employer shall use one or more generally accepted methodologies to evaluate the process hazards; What If/Checklist, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault tree Analysis, or other appropriate equivalent methodology. \nIII. The PHA shall address:\n\nA. Hazards of the process.\nB. Identification of any previous incident that did or had a likely potential for causing catastrophic consequences in the workplace.\nC. Engineering and administration controls applicable to the process (controls, alarms, detection equipment, ect.)\nD. Consequences of failure.\nE. Facility sighting.\nF. Human factors.\nG.

Typically, each of the acceptable methods will require up-to-date process flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation drawings, and data regarding process materials and conditions. Certain hazard analysis techniques may require additional, more detailed materials. \n\nThe hazard analysis is conducted with the clear goal of identifying potential hazards. Recommendations may be made with the intent of reducing or eliminating a potential hazard. Items of concern may be identified for further, more detailed study.\n\nThe follow-up phase involves evaluating the proposed recommendation to determine the appropriate course of action. The action taken may include:\n\n1. Accepting and implementing the recommendations as made;\n2. Accepting the recommendations in principle but developing an alternative approach to meet the intent; or\n3. Accepting the current situation and not implementing the recommendation.

Emergency Shutdown Systems\n\n\nFive-Year History  \n\n\nDue to our planned maintenance system, Corporate Engineering and the engineering department at Burris Refrigerated Logistics, Sumter, SC, conduct an audit quarterly. There hasn't been an accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia from this location in the past five (5) years, or since the facility was opened in 1977.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program at this facility is a current and ongoing process.  \n\n1. Evacuation drills are conducted annually. This requires the participation of all employees. \n2. The call list to surrounding businesses along with the designated person to make the calls is in place.\n3. Alarms and automated computer controlled safety's are in place. \n4. Response personnel are current with the HAZWOOPER training required by law.  \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\nSince safety is an ongoing concern at Burris Foods we have recently designated a Corporate Safety Administrator to oversee safety at all Burris facilities. This employee's responsibility will be to keep our employees and our facilities current and up to date with any new laws or procedures that become effective. Burris Refrigerated Logistics RMP has been produced in order to comply with The Clean Air Act-Section 112(r). Burris Refrigerated Logistics is a responding facility. In that we are a responding facility it is our intention to utilize our RMP to assess possible hazards, prevent them from happening and in the unlikelihood a hazard should arise, be prepared with an emergency response. Burris Foods strives to be stewards of our community and industry. We are committed to working with federal, state and local governments, as well as the public to ensure the continued safety of our employees as well as our neighbors."

      "SummaryText": "n). \n\n\nWorst Case Scenario \n\nThe worse case scenario of an ammonia spill at the Sumter, SC facility was chosen to be a vessel rupture. We have conducted our own modeling as guidance for this report. The RMP Ammonia Program Plan was closely followed to ensure compliance. As a result we have found that should a catastrophic incident occur, there would be very limited private residences in the areas of release. \n\nThe businesses that would be affected in the immediate area are on a call list and would be contacted by a designated person if an emergency would occur during normal business hours. The worse case release of Anhydrous Ammonia would come from a rupture of the high-pressure vessel that is located in the machine room. The amount of the release in the study was 5,000 pounds. The release rate is 500 pounds per minute in a 10-minute period, with a 1.5 mph wind; the distance to the end point equals 0.3 miles. There are no schools, hospitals, prisons or recreational areas within the scope of this model. There are however, office and industrial buildings in the affected area. Along with the consideration to public receptors, environmental considerations are: National and State Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, and Federal Wilderness areas. None of the environmental considerations listed above are a factor in this report. \n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \n\n\nThe alternative release scenario of Anhydrous Ammonia at the Sumter, SC facility was chosen to be a rupture from a pipe. We have conducted our own modeling as guidance for this report using the same guidelines as in the worse case scenario. The conclusion of this study has found the same results as in the worse case scenario. The amount of the release that is used is two (2) pounds. The rate of release is 0.5 lbs./min., with release duration of six (4) minutes, with a wind speed of 1.5 mph. This resulted in an endpoint of contaminated area of 0.10 miles. \n\nThe type of mitigation that would be used is as follows:\n\n1. Spr"

Implementing engineering and/or administrative controls may be used to reduce the risk of a hazard.\n\nFurther study may be required to determine if certain hazards identified are indeed significant to exposed workplace employees. This further study initially may require a more detailed hazard analysis, possibly with a different technique from a group of approved methods. Followed by a consequence analysis, that will more precisely evaluate the consequences of the potential hazards. \n\nRMP Executive Summary\nBurris Refrigerated Logistics\nSumter, SC 29154\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nBurris Refrigerated Logistics, located at 1900 Corporate Way, Sumter, SC, 29154, is a public cold storage/frozen food facility. The prime Refrigerant used is Anhydrous Ammonia in a closely controlled and monitored environment. The Refrigeration system is Computer controlled with built in safeguards which is monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The facility has personnel on call at all times that are trained and qualified to handle any emergency situation that may arise. The system is monitored in each Room that the process takes place by a computer linked detection system.  \n\nAmmonia is a self-alarming substance with a distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in the area of even small concentrations (these concentrations would not result in health risks). The Department of Transportation classifies ammonia as a non-flammable. Ammonia will burn however, but only in a very narrow and high range of concentration with high temperature. \n\nThe U.S. Occupational and Health Administration (OSHA) have made a determination on the permissible exposure of ammonia to people. The maximum allowable exposure for eight hours is 50 PPM (parts per millio"
