      "SummaryText": "The Fayette County Water System Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Safe Chlorine Handling involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and reduce the risk of accidental chlorine releases. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health, and response agency interaction.\r\n\r\nThe South Fayette Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine to disinfect surface water from Lake Horton and the Flint River. The plant can process up to 9,000,000 gallons per day and is at 880 Antioch Road in Fayette County, Georgia. The Water System provides drinking water to residents in Fayette County, Peachtree City, Tyrone, Woolsey, Brooks, and, wholesales water to Fayetteville. Industrial users are primarily concentrated in the Peachtree City industrial area.\r\n\r\nChlorine is stored at the Chemical Building and added to the water treatment process at two locations. First, chlorine is used to control biological growth through the filtration processes, and secondly, it is used to chlorinate filtered water to provide a biologically safe product. The chlorination process includes chlorine gas stored as a liquid under pressure in chlorine containers, chlorination equipment, an instrument room, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment. The facility is manned twenty-four hours a day.\r\n\r\nThere has not been an incident that resulted in either on-site or off-site injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage at the facility. In the event of a release, the Chemical Building is located in the center of the property, providing the greatest distance from surrounding properties.\r\n\r\nThe Fayette County Water System's Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\r\n\u00bf\tOper"

The Fayette County Emergency Management Agency coordinated development of the Fayette County High Risk Evacuation Plan to ensure that the community has a strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by a release. In addition, the 2020 Fayette County Hazard Mitigation Plan includes the Fayette County water treatment plants."
