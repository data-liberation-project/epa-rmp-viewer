One of the major chemical ingredients used in the PU foam manufacturing process is toluene diisocyante (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS # 26471-62-5. Our TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 lbs. In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst-case scenario is defined as the immediate spillage of the contents of a TDI railcar into a concrete spill containment area. The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model (ver. 5.4.5) and resulted in the area of concern not affecting any public receptors. The release rate, as calculated by the ALHOA model, was 0.0324 lbs./min.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel are capable of performing initial spill response. This facility may also use outside emergency responders as back-up. If required, the assistance of the Fort Smith fire department will be requested. This facility's Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and the local fire department.\n\n\n\nFoam pouring employees responsible for the handling of hazardous substances are provided initial and refresher training in spill response procedures as required by applicable sections of the USEPA, OSHA and DOT regulations.\n\n\n\n"
