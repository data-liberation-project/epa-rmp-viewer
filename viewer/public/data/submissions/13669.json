The facility has been recently modernized and expanded.  The facility refrigeration system is an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The system provides cooling for processing activities, the milk cooler, the automated storage and retrieval system and for various tanks and silos. \n\nThe expansion and modernization has resulted in increased ammonia supply for dairy refrigeration.  In line with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation Wawa DWD has conducted a process hazard analysis to identify potential operability issues, minimize potential hazards and improve the safety and operability of the ammonia refrigeration system. As a result the various elements of the PSM standard have been reviewed, updated and implemented at the facility.\n\nOperating procedures have been identified, revised and are being implemented. Employee involvement is encouraged and a safety committee is in place to assist in addrsssing and enhancing safety and health.  A contractor safety program has been instituted as well as a management of change and mechanical integrity program.  Work permit systems have been established to help ensure work conducted on the ammonia refrigeration system is controlled.  An incident investigation program includes investigation of incidents that would or could result in a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The emergency response program addresses the means for repoprting emergencies, persons responsible for the plan, procedures for emergency responders and those operating critical equipment, the facility alarm system, evacuation procedures and a procedure for personnel accounting.  A compliance audit program has also been established to evaluate the effectiveness of the program.\n\n Wawa DWD has established a working and communication network with the Middletwn Towns"

Township emergency response personnel have and will continue to tour the facility periodically and review potential release scenarios.  In addition, Wawa DWD is an active member of the Delaware County LEPC.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Wawa facility involve the release of 22,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period due to failure of an ammonia receiver.  The amount released reflects the amount of maximium ammonia that could be stored in the receiver during pump-down conditions.  Under worst-case conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site consequences.\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves the release of 2,550 pounds of ammonia over a 15-minute period from a pressure relief valve associated with a storage silo.  Under alternative release conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site consequences.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios for toxic materials are unlikely for the following reasons:     \n           The weather conditions that were used for the worst-case release scenario do not occur, while      \n           those used in the alternative case are uncommon; industry standards are followed for the design\n           and manufacture of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system; the ammonia receiver is \n           located in an enclosed area that should help to contain any ammonia releases; the engine room \n           contains an ammonia detector and ventilation fans that should detect and mitigate the effects of any \n           ammonia release; the ammonia receiver is typically only half full during normal operations; ammonia \n           is not corrosove is this service; the facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to  \n           maintain the ongoing integrity of the ammonia refrigeration equipment; the facility has a training\n           program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel"
