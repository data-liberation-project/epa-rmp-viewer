Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. The program consists of procedures for responding to a chlorine release. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including (1) proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for human exposures, (2) facility evacuation plans and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation, (3) notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and (4) post-incident follow-up requirements. Procedures are in place governing the establishment of the plant's Emergency Operation Center where management personnel can direct and control emergency operations on an as-needed basis.\n\nIn addition, we have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant facilities or to the chlorine storage and feed process, or when improvement benefits are recognized. Affected personnel are informed about, and trained on, the changes,\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) having jurisdiction in Lewis and Upshur Counties - and with Lewis County and Weston, West Virginia, emergency management officials.

In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid inside a completely enclosed chlorine storage room in our water treatment building. The containment provided by the building mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a semi-populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nA sump is provided to collect and contain portions of a liquid release that do not immediately vaporize. In reality, the sump could serve to reduce the vaporization rate of chlorine to the storage room air, and likewise reduce the rate at which chlorine gas is released from the room directly to the outside air. However, because we based our analysis on a very conservative approach, we did not take credit for the sump as a form of mitigation in reducing the endpoint distance reached off-site.\n\nNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and should one occur, to provide for effective emergency response. Controls include container design, storage, operation, maintenance and inspection; container repair and emergency response equipment; and personnel training conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, chlorine industry standards and practices, and our company's corporate policies and procedures, which are strictl"

Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for the partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which mitigates the release, and also by conservatively figuring the vacuum feed system to fail at a point during a leak. The building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a semi- populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nAs in the WCS, we have taken a very conservative approach to determining the ARS endpoint distance off-site. In determining the ARS endpoint distance we have, in this case, taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered safeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors that automatically activate an alarm in the control room and the vacuum feed system. The chlorine leak detection system is calibrated to initiate alarms at very low concentrations of chlorine (i.e., lower than industry recommended settings). Some of our additional engineering safeguards are outlined in the following section of this summary and include isolation valves. Isolation valves are provided in the downstream chlorine feed system to isolate downstream chlorine source from the pigtail leak.  As stated in the description of the WCS, numerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and to provide effective emergency response should one occur.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our site/facility emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Step"

One container is connected to the same feed piping manifold. An alternate supply arrangement consists of one additional ton containers connected to a parallel, but normally isolated, feed piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a gas to the chlorinators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the into the water stream. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS's can be used to help the Lewis/Upshur (local) Emergency Planning Committee (L/UEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with L/UEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses. For these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occur. In all cases, if such events occur, we would activate our emergency response plan to respond to the event notify local authorities, and take appropriate actions to protect our employees, contractors, and people in the community.

Our company, our employees, and contractors are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific, internal management accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past 5 years we have not had any releases involving chlorine from the RMP-covered process that had any reportable on-site or off-site effects.  Our facility has instituted procedures that require formal investigation of incidents involving chemical releases, regardless of chemical identity or listing by the EPA RMP rule. For each incident, we conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe West Virgi"
