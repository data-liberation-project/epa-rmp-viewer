      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AT WESTERN SINTERING CO INC, TO CONTROL/MINIMIZE DANGER OF AIRBORN AMMONIA GAS:  (1) Plant is located on large area of 28 acres with almost no population on adjacent properties.  (some short term populations have been present as this is zoned a light industrial area)  We could double our tank size and a worst case toxic \"end point\" would still be only 1,636 feet.  This means that the general public is not endangered and safety of the community will remain a priority concern.   The other major concern is  for our 20 employees, who \"live\"with the instructions: \"if you smell ammonia, exit the building and walk upwind...usually to the SW\".  Our prevention and safety program has expanded over 35 years:  (a) Tanks are located downwind of the plant.  (b) containment was begun in 1992 with a fence around the ammonia tanks, which of course are outside.    (c) From our first day of operation, to reduce danger within the facility, we regulated line pressure down,  to a verylow, 10 psi.    (d)  In 1997 we added ecology blocks to completely block access to ammonia tanks with any vehicle of any kind.  Access is limited to a narrow walkway, which is used for personnel and refill hoses only.  (e)  Have revised our IIPP (WA ST. Illness and Injury Prevention Plan) to include written instructions about exiting the building in case of ammonia leak.  (f)  Per EPA regulations, we have registered the existence of ammonia at this facility with Federal and State EPA, Benton County Local Emergency Preparedness and the Richland Fire Dept."
