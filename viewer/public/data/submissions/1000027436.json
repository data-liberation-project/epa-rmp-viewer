Chlorine gas is used for disinfection in the water treatment plant. Quantities handled or stored conisit of three 2000 lb. pressurized cylinders with maximum quantity 6000 lbs. The chlorine is furnished by Vopak Cinicinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio. The product is transferred along I 64 to 801 south to US 60 then east to Airport Road to the water treatment plant. The chlorine is nomally shipped in 1-ton cylinders aboard a tractor-trailer or tandem truck.                                                                                                                                                                                          Wost-case release scenarios would be gas release of 2000lbs. At arelease rate of 850 lbs/min. with duration time of 10.0 minutes. With a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec. with distance to endpoint of 5 miles with an estimated residential population within distance to endpoint of 300. Protective actions to be taken will bedecided by local officals. The response time to an incident at this facility by police fire and ambulance should not be over 10 minutes. Aevacuation radius of 10 miles was determined through the use of the EPA's Technical Guidance  for Hazard Analysis based upon the release of a one -ton cylinder of gaseous chlorine .If necessary police department will use cable override system, to alert the effected area. The evacuation routes will be US 60 east and west,519 south, north, and 32 north.

Turn off air conditioners and fans,refrain from using clothes dryers and to fill cracks where outside air may enter. This is for a short duratin time . If chemical is of a long duration time, then there would be a evacuation of the affected  area .
