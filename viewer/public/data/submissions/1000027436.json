      "SummaryText": "      In November of 2002 as part of a expansion the plant was switched from a Conventional rapid sand filtration plant to a Actiflo Process with Pre and Post chlorination. Chlorine gas is used for disinfection in the water treatment plant. Quantities handled or stored conisit of three 2000 lb. pressurized cylinders with maximum quantity 6000 lbs. The chlorine is furnished by Vopak Cinicinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio. The product is transferred along I 64 to 801 south to US 60 then east to Airport Road to the water treatment plant. The chlorine is nomally shipped in 1-ton cylinders aboard a tractor-trailer or tandem truck.                                                                                                                                                                                          Wost-case release scenarios would be gas release of 2000lbs. At arelease rate of 850 lbs/min. with duration time of 10.0 minutes. With a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec. with distance to endpoint of 5 miles with an estimated residential population within distance to endpoint of 300. Protective actions to be taken will bedecided by local officals. The response time to an incident at this facility by police fire and ambulance should not be over 10 minutes. Aevacuation radius of 10 miles was determined through the use of the EPA's Technical Guidance  for Hazard Analysis based upon the release of a one -ton cylinder of gaseous chlorine .If necessary police department will use cable override system, to alert the effected area. The evacuation routes will be US 60 east and west,519 south, north, and 32 north.

With a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec. with the distance to endpoint of 5 miles and with estimated residential population of 300 within the distance of the endpoint. They will be advised to go indoors,close all windows and vents to the outside of the buildings . Turn off air conditioners and fans,refrain from using clothes dryers and to fill cracks where outside air may enter. This is for a short duratin time . If chemical is of a long duration time, then there would be a evacuation of the affected  area . Thereason for ordering the evacuation is that the air exchange within a house/facility would cause the inside to become as toxic or contaminated as the outside air. Evacuation of threatened areas will be conducted in conformance with Annex EE to this EOP.\n        Safety: Safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards of the regulated substances used or produced by our process,the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.\n         CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: A hazmat team has been formed with the help of Rowan LEPC\n        OPERATING PROCEDURES;  Water Treatment Plant has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activites involed in each covered process that are consistent with the processsafety information.."
