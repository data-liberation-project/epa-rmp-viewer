As such, all Union Carbide facilities now operate under and adhere to policies and standards of The Dow Chemical Company.  The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Technology Park, North Charleston Distribution Terminal, Massey Yard, and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWest Virginia Operations is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe South Charleston site is a manufacturing facility that annually produces many different specialty chemicals and plastics.  Most are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  Several RMP covered processes were closed just prior to the 2004 5-year RMP Update due to business reasons, and their related chemicals have been eliminated from Union Carbide?s South Charleston facility.  Changes from the 1999 RMP submittal include the removal of: \nHMP process containing Formaldehyde.\nVinyl Ethyl Ether wa"

In December 2004, the gum base business climate changed and the demand for poly vinyl acetate increased.  A business decision was made to restart the Gum Base Plant.  Plans call for re-starting the Gum Base Plant in late March or  April 2005.  The quantities of vinyl acetate monmer stored and handled at the South Charleston Plant will not increase from those reported in the 1999 RMP Plan.\n\nUnion Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at the South Charleston Plant:\nAllyl Alcohol    \nEthylene Oxide      \nPropylene Oxide\nCrotonaldehyde\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\n\nUnion Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated flammable substances at the South Charleston Plant:\nVinyl Methyl Ether\nDimethylamine\nMethylamine\nAcetaldehyde\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSouth Charleston has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nUnion Carbide?s general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA?s PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System.  Key elements include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOu"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined),  Audits, Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Union Carbide Corporation maintains written operating procedures.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Union Carbide. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nSelf assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nUnion Carbide promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nUnion Carbide Corporation believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\nThe South Charleston facility carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition to the on-site emergency squad, Union Carbide staffs a Distribution Emergency Response Team (DERT) in the Kanawha Valley that responds to accidental releases from transportation equipment throughout the continental United States\n\nKanawha/Putnam EPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan ha"
