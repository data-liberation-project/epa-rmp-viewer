The Risk Management Plan covers the butane blending system including one horizontal storage vessel, one transfer pump, and associated piping and appurtenances.\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Niles Terminal Butane Blending System was constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association Code #58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage and it is the Facility's policy to follow the most current future editions to the extent feasible and adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local codes/laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the City of Niles Fire Department and the Berrien Sheriff's Emergency Management & Homeland Security Division, as appropriate, through the 911 Service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of Southwestern Michigan Community Ambulance Service.  The primary hospital response is provided through Lakeland Community Hospital (Bronson Trauma and Emergency Center is the nearest Trauma Center).  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Niles Terminal Butane Blending System complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D- Program Level 3).  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all 14 elements) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case and Alternate Case release scenarios were evaluated and communicated to the Niles Chart"

The Facility's Emergency Response Action Plan is coordinated with the City of Niles Fire Department and the Berrien Sheriff's Emergency Management & Homeland Security Division.  The fire department is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the event of a significant release.  The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan.\r\n\r\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety.  Also, Buckeye is implementing a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all 3 year PSM/RMP training cycles and is developing \"global\" operating procedures."
