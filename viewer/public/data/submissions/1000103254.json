The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills and releases of chemicals, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details actions to be taken by Accra-Pac, Inc. DBA Voyant Beauty for such emergencies, safety equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders. The Accra-Pac, Inc. DBA Voyant Beauty emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), RCRA Contingency Plan (40 CFR 265.5) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained our employees for emergency response action and maintain a written response plan. The plan has been coordinated with the Elkhart Fire Department and Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: \nThe Distribution Center was constructed to comply with all current safety and fire protection requirements and will continually work to improve safety in all areas. The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements.  The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personnel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response."
