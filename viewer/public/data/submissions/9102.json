      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the two most commonly used substances for treating wastewater.  The Camarillo Sanitary District Water Reclamation Plant (CSDWRP) also uses chlorine (for chlorination) and sulfur dioxide (for dechlorination) for treating wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous situations.  CSDWRP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine and sulfur dioxide as seriously as it takes in providing the environment safe disinfected water. CSDWRP's chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n7 Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n7 General facility and regulated substances information.\n7 Offsite consequence analysis results.\n7 Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n7 Five-year accident history summary.\n7 Emergency response program summary.\n7 Planned changes to improve safety.\nThe above information for the CSDWRP chlorination and dechlorination systems are provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe CSDWRP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.

CSDWRP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for chlorine and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with local response agencies, such as the Resources Management Agency, Environmental Health Division, Ventura County. CSDWRP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Camarillo Sanitary District Water Reclamation Plant is located on 150 Howard Road in Camarillo, California.  The treatment facility is located on a land area of approximately 20 acres, bounded by Pleasant Valley Road to the north, Pancho Road to the west and Howard Road to the south.\nThe Camarillo Sanitary District Water Reclamation facility has operated since 1957.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages from the original 2.75 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) to current capacity of 6.75 mgd. The wastewater treated at Camarillo Sanitary District Water Reclamation Plant originates mainly from approximately 37,000 domestic and industrial users in the City of Camarillo; a small fraction is of agricultural origin.  Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process with post-chlorination and dechlorination to yield a secondary effluent for purposes of re-use and/or discharge.\n\nAnhydrous chlorine used for chlorination is delivered to the facility in one-ton containers and stored inside the chlorine stora"

Anhydrous sulfur dioxide used for dechlorination is also delivered to the facility in one-ton sulfur dioxide containers and stored inside the sulfur dioxide storage room. \nThe purpose of the chlorination system is to prevent the spread of water borne diseases by means of chemically treating the plant effluent to kill disease-causing organisms.  The chlorination system consists of twelve one-ton chlorine containers, three evaporators, four chlorinators, one ejector, two residual analyzers, three chlorine detectors, diffusers, chlorine contact basins, piping and other equipment.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present in the chlorine storage room can be as much as 12 tons.  In the case of a major leak, the chlorine gas analyzers are used to sense chlorine leaks in the chlorine storage room. Upon detection of approximately 1 ppmv chlorine, the analyzers will send a signal which will shut down the normal ventilation system to contain the chlorine gas within the chlorine storage room.  The caustic scrubber system is activated in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\nThe purpose of the dechlorination system is to inject sulfur dioxide solution into the plant effluent to dechlorinate the effluent.  This is done to meet the waste discharge requirements of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Region 4, Los Angeles Region.  The sulfur dioxide system consists of eight one-ton sulfur dioxide containers, two evaporators, four sulfonators and four ejectors, diffusers and other piping and equipment, most of which is located in the sulfur dioxide storage room.  Sulfur dioxide is diffused into the effluent channel at the discharge of the chlorine contact basin. The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide present in the sulfur dioxide storage room can be as much as 8 tons.

The caustic scrubber system is activated in the event of a sulfur dioxide leak.\n\nUpon detection of a 1 ppm chlorine leak or a 10 ppm sulfur dioxide leak, the following process is initiated:  a) the normal ventilation system is shut down in the leak area to contain the gas within the room, b) local visual and audible alarms are actuated, c) remote alarms at the distributed control system operator interface unit located in the control room, and the scrubber control panel are activated, d) the containment valve in the building that does not have the leak is closed, and e) the selected duty caustic recirculation pump is started.  The scrubber is manually shut down when the chlorine or sulfur dioxide concentration reaches 1 ppm.\n\nThe control room at the plant is manned 8 hours a day, year round.  The plant is monitored during the 16 unmanned hours by complete alarm system in communication with a contracted answering service.  If the alarm system is activated, the answering service contacts the stand-by employee who then responds.

For the worst-case release scenario analysis, two scenarios were considered: (1) complete de-inventory of a 1-ton chlorine container and (2) complete de-inventory of a 1-ton sulfur dioxide container.  A screening analysis performed using the EPAs RMP*Comp software indicated that the toxic endpoint distance for the sulfur dioxide release would be larger in comparison to a chlorine release scenario.  Thus, refined dispersion modeling was performed for only sulfur dioxide release for the worst-case release scenario.  The 1-ton (2,000 pound) of sulfur dioxide represents the worst-case release quantity for the covered processes at the CSDWRP facility.  No passive mitigation or administrative controls were considered for the worst-case release scenario.  Thus, the release rate will be 200 pounds per minute (lbs./min.)\n\nThe released liquid chlorine/sulfur dioxide is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) Model.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice, this type of a total failure of ton containers would be unlikely.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (98 deg F), and average relative humidity (50%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.

      "SummaryText": "that this scenario has offsite impacts.\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination and dechlorination facilities pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the CSDWRP boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis, which would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement for chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. \n\nSince chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only two regulated toxic substance used at the facility, two alternative scenarios were selected for the offsite consequence analysis.  \n\nThe scenarios selected for the CSDWRP chlorination and dechlorination systems involve the release of chlorine/sulfur dioxide from the pigtails connecting the ton containers to chlorination and dechlorination processes.  These scenarios can occur if the operator uses a pigtail, which is worn or has a defect, which results in a crack in the pigtail during the withdrawal of chlorine/sulfur dioxide from the ton containers.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 0.25-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.0625-inch (1/16 inch) diameter.  The control"

It is assumed that approximately thirty minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond and close the ton container valve.\n\nThe chlorine release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 0.6 lb./min.  However, the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.001 lb/min. The sulfur dioxide release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 0.3 lb/min.  However, the sulfur dioxide release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.004 lb/min.  Since the chlorine and sulfur dioxide release from the scrubber stacks would be neutrally buoyant, EPA's SCREEN3 model was used for the air dispersion analysis.  The meteorological conditions used for the alternative release scenario analysis were Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 60.6 deg F, and average humidity of 50%.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the maximum ground level one hour average concentration for both regulated substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) would be less than 0.1 ppm (0.01 ppm for chlorine and 0.03 ppm for sulfur dioxide).  These concentrations are significantly lower than 3 ppm, the toxic endpoints for chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and will have no offsite impacts.\n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of these scenarios are highly unlikely because the pig tails are carefully inspected during each connection/disconnection operation, and during operator rounds.\nFinally, no chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the CSDWRP during the last five years.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCSDW"
