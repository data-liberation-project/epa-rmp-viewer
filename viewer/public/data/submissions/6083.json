We use a combination of safety programs, accidental release prevention programs, and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n7 A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\n7 A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases;\n7 An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n7 A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule; and\n7 An overview of our emergency response program.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nOur facility uses Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Ethylene Oxide (EO) in the production of Sodium Hydrosulfite and Sodium Bisulfite for use in the clay, textile, and pulp and paper industries.  The EPA has identified sulfur dioxide and ethylene oxide as having the potential to cause adverse offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of sulfur dioxide and ethylene oxide.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios:\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "
