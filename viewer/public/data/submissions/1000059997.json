These procedures along with training of affected personnel form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Hilight gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to 1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, 2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change, and 3) ensure that changes do not introduce an unknown hazard to the process.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Hilight gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, or significant environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits \r\n\r\nTo guarantee"

Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Hilight gas plant is located about 20 miles south of Gillette, Wyoming.  The facility includes liquid recovery using a refrigeration system, compression, dehydration, power generation, and fractionation.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, liquid propane, liquid butane and a mixed natural gas liquid stream (natural gasoline).  The liquid products contain ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier components.  The liquids that are recovered from the refrigeration process including propane, butane and the natural gasoline are shipped from the plant by truck and railcar.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  Since the plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic, there are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Hilight facility.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.   The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is part of the PSM program.  This program as well as the other documentation is maintained at the gas plant. In addition the PSM program requires that we address process and employee safety issues as part of our normal operations.  These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change, safe work practices, and participation in flowsheet reviews. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Hilight gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. \r\n\r\nThe Hilight gas plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergency situations."

      "SummaryText": "sure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Hilight gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Hilight gas plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to veri"
