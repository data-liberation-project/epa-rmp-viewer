      "SummaryText": "Abilene Wastewater Treatment Plant\nRisk Managemant Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe City of Abilene, Texas (City) operates the Abilene Wastewater Reclamation Plant (Plant or WWTP) which is located in Jones County, Texas.  The Plant treats wastewater for the City of Abilene, as well as for wholesale customers in the Cities of Tuscola and Tye. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the plant.  Up to 40,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the Plant. Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (A?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The WWTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (A?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the CityA?s Director of Water Utilities (Director) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \n\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for wastewater operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WWTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WWTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturersA? recommendations (A?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WWTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (A?68.42(a)).  "

      "ESSeqNum": 1,

      "SummaryText": "As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews, and incident investigations according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (A?68.50 & A?68.58).\n\nThe WWTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR A?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The WWTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response. The City of AbileneA?s Office of Emergency Management maintains a community-wide Emergency Response Plan which encompasses the WWTP. Pursuant to the CityA?s Emergency Response Plan WWTP operators are trained to notify the CityA?s Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the WWTP.  The City of AbileneA?s Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the CityA?s Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (A?68.90(b)).  \n"
