We calculated several alternate or more likely release scenarios and the toxic endpoint of all these scenarios was up to 0.1 miles.  There are no residences within the alternate or more likely scenarios.  The worst-case and alternate-case models were produced using Marplot. The toxic endpoint was determined using EPA's RMPComp.\r\n \r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  This facility has developed a prevention program which complies with the requirements of OSHA CFR 29, 1910.119 Process Safety Management and EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan. This program includes procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without catastrophic release.\r\n \r\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN:  The Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event. The facility would dial 911 and the Dallas Fire Departments' Station 52 and the Dallas HAZMAT would respond to any incident requiring an emergency response.  The local fire department is included in our notification procedures and emergency action plan.  Our personnel are trained to assist the responders with information only, but would not participate in an actual response requiring entry into an ammonia atmosphere or if it required Level A suits.\r\n \r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  The facility was built in 2005 and put in service in 2006.  The only incident since that time was a release of ammonia through a faulty safety relief valve on July 24, 2017.  The release of ammonia was discharged through the vent piping that extends at least 15 feet above the ground and 20 feet or more away from a window, door or intake fan to the facility.  The facility dialed 911 and the Dallas HAZMAT responded.  It was determined that approximately 42 pounds of ammonia was released through the vent piping to the atmosphere.  The wind was blowing that day and some ammonia entered the"

      "SummaryText": "STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:  The stationary source is defined as EPI Breads facility located at 4710 West Ledbetter Drive, Dallas, TX.  EPI Breads produces bread all types of customized breads for restaurants and supermarkets.  The facility serves customers from national chains to small independents with hoagies & sub rolls, buns, artisan & specialty breads.  The facility has one refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S. #7664-41-7. The ammonia refrigeration system is used only to refrigerate two spiral freezers to cool the bread.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility. The Ammonia Refrigeration System contains approximately 12,250 pounds of ammonia. The facility exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION:  Releases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls. Engineering controls include automated component shutdowns in case safe parameters would be exceeded. Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel. The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels. Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE SCENARIOS:  Computer air models were developed based on a worst-case release scenario involving the catastrophic structural failure of the system's recirculator vessels. By EPA definition, the worst-case scenario is considered to be the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel in the system (which is the recirculator vessel) to be released over a ten minute period.  The capacity of the recirculator vessel is more than the total charge of the ammonia refrigeration system; therefore, we are using the total inventory quantity being released as the worst-case scenario.  Under this scenario, the distanc"
