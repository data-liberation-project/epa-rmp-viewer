Facility Policy\n\n                    The owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n             2.   Facility Information\n\n                   The primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \n\n                   Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a fertilizer for crop production. \n\n                    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored is in tanks at 85% full.  In addition, nurse tanks are generally here.    \n\n             3.        The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n                     A.  The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be  the  release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10  minutes.  \n\n                     B.  The alternative release scenario ( the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \n\n    4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n              Western Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\n\n              Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American\n\n              National Standards Institute Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety\n\n              and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and Handling of\n\n              Anhydrous Ammonia\".  In addition, we comply with all applicable federal (EPA), state\n\n              and local requirements.\n\n    \n\n    To Prevent a ?Worst Case Release  Scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario?, our ammonia systems are protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, barriers, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  All main storage tank and fill valves are locked when not in use.  The systems are inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  \n\n    To prevent a ?Alternative Release Senario?, kiquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guide-lines in ANSI standards.  If pumps or valves need repair, repair is performed by an outside qualified company or they are replaced.  Safety procedures include mandatory us of PPE, emergency water  and following the procedures established by Western Iowa Coop, including choking wagon wheels to prevent movement and a broken hose.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  Training consists of classroom lecture, current videos and on the job training.  Topics covered in this training include; safety, operating procedure for plant startup, plant shutdown, filling nurse tanks, unloading a transport, emergency shutdown and startup after emergency shutdown.   \n\n      5.    The Five Year Accident History\n\n              Western Iowa Coop has had no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the\n\n              past five years.                 \n\n      6.     The Emergency Response Program.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to insure that they are familiar and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to insure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigati"
