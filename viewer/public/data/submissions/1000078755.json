This commitment is demonstrated by our dedication of staff and resources to our accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and self-audits. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe plant uses chlorine for disinfection in the treatment of water before distribution. Chlorine is the only regulated substance at the plant. The 2,000-lb container is the largest chlorine vessel on-site and all the containers are stored in an enclosed building, with a scrubber system that draws in contaminated air for treatment upon chlorine gas detection above 3 parts per million.\r\n\r\nThe chlorination system must meet Program 3 prevention program level requirements because the plant is operated by private contractor employees, which are subject to Federal OSHA regulations. The elements in the program address process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, staff training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractors. Addressing the requirements of each element provides the foundation of the plant's accidental release prevention program. Program requirements are integrated into the daily operation of the chlorination system by the Plant Manager and the operations and maintenance staff.\r\n\r\nThe Bear Creek Water Treatment Plant did not have reportable accidental releases in the previous five-year period.\r\n\r\nThe plant has an emergency response program in place to enable the staff to effectively respond to a minor chlorine release, minimize injuries, lessen the impact to the surrounding community, and provide guidance to emergency responders during a major chlorine release"

      "SummaryText": ". The staff receives annual training at a minimum on established procedures for staff and visitor accounting, seeking outside assistance as needed, and providing public notifications.\r\n\r\nThe plant has coordinated with the Jackson County Government Department of Emergency Services and the South Jackson County Fire Department, which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to respond to a major chlorine release.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety include annual coordination activities with emergency responders, to update contact information and mutual expectations; using a different PHA methodology; and adding new team members to the PHA and compliance audit teams to refresh these activities and to promote new viewpoints and discussions on potential hazards and consequences."
