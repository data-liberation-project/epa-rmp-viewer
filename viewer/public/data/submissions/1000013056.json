      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary: \n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Flint Hills Resources, LP (FHR) Junction City, Wisconsin facility (Facility).  This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under 40 CFR Part 68 and 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The Junction City facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of propane above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nFlint Hills Resources is committed to protecting the environment and operating facilities in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public.  FHR management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety is the number one consideration in the handling of propane; our goal is to prevent accidental releases through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel.  The Facility is operated consistent with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements for propane facilities.\n\n\n\nIn the event that a release does occur, the Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) is available in hard copy format at the terminal.  The ERAP is also available as part of the electronic Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) for the Junction City terminal which has been distributed to local emergency responders and is available to all terminal employees.\n\n \n\n2.    Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Junction City facility operates as a bulk fuel distribution and storage terminal.  The propane terminal distributes propane to wholesale customers.  Propane is received directly from a 6 inch pipeline, stored in product vessels and distributed to customers via bulk tanker trucks at the propane loading rack.  Propane is the only RMP regulated substance that the Facility h"

Ethyl mercaptan, a RMP regulated substance, is used to stench propane gas at the Facility, but the quantity stored is below regulatory threshold quantities.    \n\n\n\nAccess to the Facility is restricted by a card operated gate. Customers possessing access cards may load trucks 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The terminal is manned 10 hours a day Monday through Friday. \n\n\n\nThe Facility has one (1) truck loading island for propane that is served by two (2) centrifugal type loading pumps capable of loading two (2) trucks at a time. Atmospheric vent piping is connected to a common header leading to a vent stack located to the northeast of the propane facility.\n\n\n\nPropane is stored at the Facility in eight (8) 84,000 gallon storage vessels (bullets) for a total storage capacity of approximately 672,000 gallons.  The actual storage capacity is 85% of the water capacity, or 571,200 gallons, to allow for product expansion within the storage vessels.  The Facility utilizes a molecular sieve filter system to scrub propane received from the pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe Facility also operates two 500 gallon propane tanks which are excluded from the RMP program provisions due to their use as a fuel (40 CFR 68.126).  One of the propane tanks is used for office building heating and the second tank is used in the facilityA?s vapor combustion unit.\n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nFHR has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by the EPA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and all notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations.  The Facility complies with both RMP and PSM for the management of propane.  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFHR encourages employees to participate in safety management and accident prevention. The Facility has developed an employee participat"

All Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel at any time.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\n\nAn initial process hazard analysis (PHA) was completed for the Junction City propane system in February of 1993.  The PHA is revalidated at least every five years.  The controlled copy of the PHA is maintained at the terminal and details the study methodology used, items reviewed during the study (i.e., hazards of the process, facility sitting, etc.), study team composition requirements, and the system used to address study findings and recommendations. \n\n\n\nThe Hazards and Operability (HAZOP) review technique was the primary tool used to conduct hazard evaluation studies of the propane storage and loading facilities. The HAZOP technique is a systematic method for identifying all the ways that process equipment can malfunction or be improperly operated, leading to hazardous conditions. To apply the HAZOP technique, the unit is divided into logical process sections (major vessels, pumps, interconnecting process piping, etc.). For each process section, the PHA team (1) determines if any significant safety consequences would result from the credible deviations, (2) identifies potential causes of significant safety consequences, (3) lists the engineered and administrative safeguards protecting against particular deviations, and (4) suggests actions that might reduce the likelihood or severity of the deviations.\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains documents describing process safety information for the propane system, including material safety data sheets.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\nJunction City Terminal "

The operating procedures that have been developed have been prepared as a guide for those involved with the initial start up, normal operation, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown of the propane system. The Facility has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in facility operations.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nPrior to all awarded contracts, the FHR representative evaluates the prior safety performance of any prospective contractor. After the contractor has been selected, the FHR representative shall conduct a contractor orientation meeting with the contract employer representative. At that time, FHR reviews with the contract employer representative all known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards which are related to the contractor's work and the terminal process. The contract employer representative is also informed of the applicable provisions of the terminal's emergency action plan, as well as conditions regarding entrance and the safe work practices to which the Contractor will have to abide in order to be allowed to work at the site. Because contractors may work on or near the process equipment, the Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, and are aware of the hazards in their workplace.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nAs part of the MOC process, whenever a modification to the existing chemical process is planned, either temporary or permanent, a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is required.  The PSSR shall confirm that prior to putting into service, the construction and equipment being used is in accordance with design specifications. The PSSR also confirms that the safety, operatin"
