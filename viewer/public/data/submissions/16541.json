      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Bayer Corporation-Pharmaceutical Division, West Haven, CT are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with West Shore Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacturing, research and development of pharmaceutical products.  We have (one) 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia.  The regulated substance at our facility is used for Refrigeration purpose only.\n\nThe total inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 70,000.00 lb.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the tables in the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities.  For alternative release scenario analysis, we have employed the tables and methods in the EPA's RMP Ammonia Refrigeration Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a storage or receiving vessel in the Refrigeration System"

      "FacilityID": 16541,
      "SummaryText": ".  The scenario involves the release of 15,000.00 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.80 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  The maximum distance to endpoint was calculated using EPA's Guidance on Effectiveness of Building Mitigation for Worse-Case Scenario (dated November 19, 1998).\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in Program 3 process.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from Central Utilities Plant  (CUP)  B-45 in the Refrigeration System process.  The scenario involves the release of 65.00 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 2 minutes due to rupture disk/ relief valve opening as a result of overpressure during re-start-up.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes, enclosures, sumps, berms and 24-hour monitoring are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include sprinkler system(s), deluge system(s), water curtain(s), scrubbers, neutralization and emergency shutdown systems.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is 0.04 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  A single of process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBayer Corporation-Pharmaceutical Division, West Haven, CT maintains a detailed record of safety information"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"HAZOP\".  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five (5) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Bayer Corporation-Pharmaceutical Division, West Haven, CT maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nBayer Corporation-Pharmaceutical Division, West Haven, CT has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processe are competent in the operating procedures associated with this process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.
