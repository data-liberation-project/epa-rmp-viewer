      "SummaryText": "Gulf Chemical & Metallurgical Corporation has safety emergency programs in place to manage and respond to incidents involving safety. The programs in place include those required by 40 CFR Part 68, Subp[part G. \"Risk Management Plan\" (RMP).\n\nThr RMP specifically addresses accidental release prevention and emergency response for anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous liquid ammonia is stored in a tank and it is used in the manufacture of molybdenum and vanadium compounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the full tank, 70,000 lbs. The distance to the ERPG-2 would be approximately 5.3 miles. The distance to the ERPG-3 end point would be approximately 1.7 miles. Both determined using EPA tables.\n\nThe alternative release scenario would be the rupture of a one inch pipe releasing 777 lbs of ammonia in ten minutes. The distance to the ERPG-2 would be approximately 0.2 miles. The distance to the ERPG-3 end poit would be approximately 0.1 miles. Both determined using EPA tables.\n\nIncluded in the RMP plan are:\n\n1. Registration describing administrative and mitigation measures, release prevention program, five year accidental release history and emergency reponse program.\n2. Chemical Information Sheet for public distribution.\n3. Certification\n\nThe site has decreased inventory levels on anhydrous ammonia and is currently not a PSM regulated process. The site is re-evaluating 40 CFR 68 to ascertain if it still will apply to the site. Until that assessment is complete we will continue to maintain our current RMP."
