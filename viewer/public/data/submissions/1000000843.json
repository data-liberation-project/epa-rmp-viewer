Our Emergency Action Plan applies to the use of chlorine in the water treatment process at the Town of Smyrna Water Treatment Plant.  The purpose of the plan is to aid the Town of Smyrna in its efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic releases of chlorine that could result in the catastrophic loss of personnel and property within the facility and possibly the surrounding community.\n\nOur facility, the Smyrna Water Treatment Plant, utilizes chlorine as its primary disinfectant in the process of treating drinking water.  The building is enclosed and with the only possible leaks occurring at the cylinder.  The room has constant video monitoring and a chlorine scrubber along with constant air monitoring of the room for chlorine.  This chlorine monitor activates the scrubber and sounds an audible alarm and sets off alarm lighting.\n\nChlorine has physical properties and health hazards that would present immediate danger to life and health (IDLH) conditions in the event of an uncontrolled gas release.  The following section consists of a review of the inherent physical and health hazards associated with chlorine for emergency response personnel.\n\nPhysical Properties\n\na.\tAt room temperatures, chlorine is a gas.\nb.\tIf chlorine is cooled to 29.3 degrees F, it becomes an amber color liquid.  It is usually shipped as a liquid in order to save space.\nc.\tIf liquid chlorine escapes from a container it will usually be boiling and convert to a greenish-yellow color gas.\nd.\tIt has an irritating odor (bleach) and is 2 \u00c2\u00bd times heavier than air, so it will usually gather low to the ground.\ne.\tChlorine is soluble in water, but reacts with water to form hydrochloric acid, which is highly corrosive.\nf.\tNFPA has assigned a hazard r"

Chlorine will cause irritation of the upper respiratory system and mucus membranes at 3 \u00c2\u00bf 6 ppm.\nb.\tThe TOSHA permissible exposure limit for chlorine is represented by a ceiling value of 1 ppm.  NIOSH assigned an IDLH value of 10 ppm for acute chlorine exposure.\nc.\tExposure to exposed skin or eyes can cause serious frostbite burns.\nd.\tInhalation of chlorine gas can lead to adverse acute health effects including:  irritation of the upper respiratory system, violent coughing, choking, nausea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, chest pains, shortness of breath and pulmonary edema.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:  Chlorine is dropped during loading/unloading/handling, resulting in the rupturing of the cylinder or valve stem and the uncontrolled release of the contents of the cylinder.  In the event of a fire in or near the chlorine room that may cause the fusible plug to melt in the cylinder or from a faulty fusible plug.\n \nAlternate Scenario:  The yoke on the cylinder valve is defective, malfunctions or is improperly installed onto a chlorine cylinder, resulting in the limited yet uncontrolled release of gas from the cylinder.  The valve packing leaks from a defective chlorine cylinder resulting in the limited yet uncontrolled release of gas.  The yoke is not properly set and tightened on the cylinder valve.  The yoke was not properly cleaned with the wire brush prior to installing the washer.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nFive year accident history:  We have only had very small releases that are common when changing chlorine cylinders.  We follow a very strong maintenance program to change out all hoses, fittings and seals to reduce the risk of equipment failure.  No one on-site or off-site has been injured and t"
