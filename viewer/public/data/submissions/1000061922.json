ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\r\n\r\nCoastal Sunbelt Produce (CSP)utilizes anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  CSP strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Savage Fire Department to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the temporary storage of refrigerated and frozen foods as well as non refrigerated goods.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration or freezing units.  Access to t"
