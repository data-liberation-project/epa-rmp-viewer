      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe City of Cloverdale treatment and disposal facilities have been designed to serve the incorporated community of Cloverdale.  The wastewater treatment plant is a biological treatment type, secondary treatment facility designed for an average dry weather flow of 1.0 million gallons per day.  The treatment plant facilities consist of a headworks, aeration ponds, storage ponds, chlorination equipment, effluent pumping facilities, dechlorination equipment and effluent outfall.\n\nAs part of the treatment process two regulated substances are used.  They include chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process to properly disinfect the plant effluent.  Chlorine is piped and mixed with water using chlorovacs.  Sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the chlorinated effluent prior to discharging to the Russian River if needed.  This is only done in times of an emergency when the plant may become overburdened with heavy flow and rains.  The plant is required to obtain State approval prior to discharge.  The last time sulfur dioxide and discharge to the river was done in 1994.  As with chlorine, the sulfur dioxide is mixed with water and added to the flow steam.\n\nThe City of Cloverdale aggressively pursues the best practices available when preparing safety and risk management plans.  In the past five years the wastewater treatment plant has had only  minor issues with chlorine.  One of these was a loose connection and just needed to be tightened 1/2 of a turn-corrected.\n\nIn an effort to assure that plant personnel are aware of emergency procedures when handling regulated substances the City has on site training sessions with the experts from the chemical supply companies.  In addition, included in the plants operation manual is a listing of the emergency operations to follow in the event of a problem.  The following outlines the City's emergency response program:\n\n1.Get help  Never enter the area where chemicals are leaking alo"

If the leak is large all persons in adjacent areas should be warned and evacuated by the police.\n\n2. Obtain proper safety equipment including SCBA's and tools for repairs and emergency repair kit.\n\n3. Locate a leak by tying a cloth soaked in 26% solution ammonia to the end of  a stick and holding it close to the suspected area.  A white cloud will result if there is a leak.\n\n4. Never use water on a chlorine leak.  The corrosive action chlorine and water will make the leak worse.\n\n5. Describes processes to follow to control leaks in equipment and pipes, valves, and the containers.\n\n6. Describes processes to follow to apply first aid to slight exposure to chemicals.\n\n7. Describes processes to follow to apply first aid to serious exposure of chemicals.\n\n\nWe have included a worst case scenario which includes a total release of a 1-ton cylinder of chlorine.  We have also included the same case for sulfur dioxide, which is located approximately 1200 feet away.  Under the worst case scenario the 1-ton chlorine cylinder will leak 2000 pounds of chlorine the building over a ten minute period.  The storage room is not fitted with windows and the doors are always closed.  The 4576 cf room does have one manually operated fan which is capable of exchanging the air in the room 13 times per hour.  Following EPA RMP guidelines this leak will Release 40 pounds of chlorine per minute and cover a theoretical area of approximately 0.6 miles until its end point is reached.\n\nThe reason we state that the coverage area is theoretical is because of a few factors.  First,  the treatment facility is located down gradient from neighboring residences.  Since both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are heavier than air they tend to travel along the ground to reach the lowest point which in this case is away from houses and downtown. In addition, the 101 hi"

With the plant being located southeast of residences it is also located down wind.\n\nIncluded in our alternative release scenario is a look at what the coverage area would be if the manual exhaust fans, which are located in both the chlorine room and dechlorination building, were not turned on.  In this case the same spill would slowly vent through the floor vent in those buildings.  The air exchanges in the rooms would drop significantly to possibly one per hour.  In this scenario the guidelines indicate that the chemicals endpoint would be reached at approximately 0.4 miles and include approximately 500 people.  Again, this coverage area is theoretical and does not take into account the factors mentioned above."
