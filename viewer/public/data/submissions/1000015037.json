It is MRD's policy to conduct its operations in accordance with the highest standards of environmental stewardship, employee and contractor safety and community responsibility.   As part of this policy, MRD has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at MRD and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at MRD.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at MRD.\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMRD has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the public, its employees and contractors and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary element of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the refinery.  MRD utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures to reduce the probability of an accidental release.  \n\nIn the event of a release, the MRD has a well trained emergency response team (ERT) to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release.

In conjunction with the Wayne County and Detroit local emergency planning committees (LEPCs), the refinery has the ability to notify the local community through media broadcasting systems.\n\nThe Michigan Refining Division Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at MRD.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the division organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the division's process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division's Environmental, Safety and Security Manager.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the Division's PSM Coordinator.  The Division's emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Environmental, Safety and Security Manager.

The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  MRD does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the refinery. Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.
