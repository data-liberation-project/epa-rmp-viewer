Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail, Inc. conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Taylor Farms Retail facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for storage cooling, and vacuum cooling. Refrigeration System drawings located in Chapter 8 of RMP Binder show the facility location map and site plan. The facility was built in 2004 and operated by a different company. Taylor Fresh Foods purchased the facility in 2008 and replaced/modified some pressure vessels and added process chillers. River Ranch Fresh Foods leased and operated the facility from November 2012 to summer of 2014. Taylor Farms Retail, Inc. has since become the new operator and initiated facility start-up for the winter sea"

      "SummaryText": "son of 2014. Starting 2017 season, Taylor Retail stopped its produce processing operations and removed the water chillers from the site. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. The fixed system includes cold room evaporative cooling coils, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps and diffusion tank. Portable systems are two high side skids and one high side trailer that are connected to the fixed system, and four separate high side trailer vacuum tube pairs.\n\nThere are 5 separate ammonia refrigeration process at the site during the operational season. \n\n1. Main Fixed System - 11,650 lbs of Ammonia\n\n2. R-19 Full Car Vacuum Cooling System - 4,660 Lbs of Ammonia\n\n3. R-49 Full Car Vacuum Cooling System - 3,270 Lbs of Ammonia\n\n4. R-45 Half Car Vacuum Cooling System - 2,570 Lbs of Ammonia\n\n3. R-50 Half Car Vacuum Cooling System - 1,850 Lbs of Ammonia\n\n                                 TOTAL = 24,000 Lbs of Ammonia\n\n\n\nAll of the refrigeration equipment except the cold room coils are located outdoors. Refrigeration Trailers are leased from Western Precooling Systems (WPS). The remaining systems are owned by Taylor Farms Retail, Inc.. The system was constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 24.000 lb.  \n\n \n\nThe facility operates on a seasonal basis approximately from November 15 through April 15. During the offseason period, all the refrigeration trailers and the vacuum tubes are removed from the site, and the ammonia is stored in (6) 1,000 gallon Ammonia Storage Tanks (Nurse Tanks) during off season.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system at this facility is a single stage vapor compressor cycle. In general, the process chemistry for this system is shown in Chapter 8 of RMP\n\n\n\nA list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in the schedules located in Chapter 12 Appendix.

      "SummaryText": "titute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Chapter 12 Appendix, describe equipment details.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia is provided in RMP.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail, Inc. maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see the Incident Investigation procedures in Chapter 16.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and Refrigeration Contractors are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. System compressors have safety cut out switches that shuts down the compressors if system pressure reaches unsafe levels. Pressure vessels have float switches that controls the liquid levels in the vessels, and in low pressure receiver case, shuts down the ammonia pumps to prevent cavitation if the liquid level drops below certain level. All cold rooms are monitored by an alarm and detection system for unsafe ammonia concentration levels. Monitoring is done 24-hours per day. All relief valves except the surge drums of two vacuum tubes are tied "

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAccording to Taylor Farms Retail and previous operator, River Ranch Fresh Foods, personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Chapter 20 of RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the PHA and safety inspection are listed in Chapter 00 as \"Correction Items\". All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n"
