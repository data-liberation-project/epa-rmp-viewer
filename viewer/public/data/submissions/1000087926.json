The major components of the program include meeting and/or exceeding legal and regulatory requirements, an overall environmental, safety, and health management system, terminal operating procedures, and personnel training.  Inland works closely with emergency responders, the public, and the local community to ensure an effective emergency response plan is in place.\n\n\n\n(b) The Stationary Source and Substance Handled: \n\nThe Inland Bridgeport Terminal is owned by Inland Fuel Terminals, Incorporated, with headquarters in Bridgeport, CT. At this terminal, tank trucks of propane are off-loaded into a storage tank.  As needed, the propane is taken out of the tank and loaded into tank trucks for off-site delivery. Propane is the Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) regulated chemical stored at the terminal which exceeds a threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \n\nThe Inland Bridgeport Terminal is a secured facility which is manned during normal business hours (only approved truckers can perform loading and unloading during other hours). The terminal is regulated as a Program Level 3, CAP facility.  General accidental release prevention programs and propane-specific release prevention steps incorporated for the covered process include the following:\n\n- The terminal is a fully fenced facility, with access gates to limit entry to authorized personnel only\n\n- Operating procedures have been developed and implemented for operations performed by terminal operators\n\n- The Terminal Operations Manager and Terminal Operators are provided with initial and refresher training in accordance with the"

Terminal Operators are trained to the HAZWOPER Operations level, inclusive of required refresher training. They receive training on the terminal's Emergency Response Plan and participate in an emergency response drill on a routine basis. Inland has a contract with a private hazardous material/emergency response contractor who is available 24-hours per day, 7-days a week on an on-call basis. Inland is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The terminal's Emergency Response Plan addresses protecting the public and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety: \n\nThe Inland Bridgeport Terminal completed its most recent compliance audit in May of 2020. As a result of the audit, improvements to the process and the risk management program have either been completed or are planned.  The improvements were focused on improving the safety of the pro"
