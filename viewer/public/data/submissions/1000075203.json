HCC is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about the safety of its employees and the neighboring Community.  HCC staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facility to provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia for pollution control.  Ammonia plays a key role in nearly eliminating potentially harmful pollutants from the HCC Wilmington Plant turbine exhaust.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe HCC Wilmington Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the Wilmington Plant processes.  HCC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Wilmington Plant has been designated by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and is identified in the Business Emergency Plan as a \"non-responding facility,\" and an Emergency Response Plan is not required.  However, to address the above objectives, on a proactive basis, a detailed Emergency Action Plan has been created and is maintained to support the Wilmington Plant's responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of emergency response (i.e., coordination of the response activities between on-site response capabilities and municipal emergency response capabilities).  The emergency pre-planning and responses identified in the Emergency Action Plan are for the purpose of supporting the overall effectiveness of the municipa"

Various reviews and updates have occurred throughout the life of the facility as part of Harbor Cogeneration Company's diligent interest in the protection of personnel and the Community, as well as regulatory requirements such as PSM and RMPP.  The July 30, 2012 Emergency Action Plan represents an evolution of previous revisions, is complete, is current, and meets or exceeds key regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Action Plan include:\n\n\n\n - Identification of emergency duties\n\n - Clear identification of emergency goals and objectives \n\n - An Emergency Action Guide\n\n - Key phone numbers and contact points for Municipal and Mutual Aid Emergency Response\n\n - Incident Command System (ICS) definition\n\n - Vicinity maps with emergency mitigation equipment identified\n\n - Detailed task-by-task plans for:\n\n     - Injury and Illness\n\n     - Natural Disasters (Earthquake)\n\n     - Bomb Threat\n\n     - Fire\n\n     - Off-Site Emergency \n\n     - Hazardous Material Release (e.g., ammonia, sulfuric acid/caustic soda, other materials)\n\n     - Civil Disturbance\n\n     - Intrusion\n\n\n\nAs a \"non-responding facility,\" the Wilmington Plant does not have a designated emergency response team; however, Los Angeles City Fire Department specialists are trained and fully equipped to respond to hazardous material releases.

This Plan will be reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nAlthough at the time of this CalARP/RMP Submittal, the oil field is shut-in, the Harbor Cogeneration Company Wilmington Plant was designed to support thermally enhanced oil recovery operations by cogenerating electricity and steam, using natural gas and refinery gas to fire a turbine and other auxiliary equipment.  Electricity is supplied to the utility grid, and steam production is currently used to operate two steam turbine generators for production of electricity. \n\n\n\nThe exhaust gas from the cogeneration unit contains oxides of nitrogen (Nox).  The emissions are reduced to authorized levels by mixing the turbine exhaust gas with small amounts of ammonia and passing them over a catalyst.  The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process involves Nox and ammonia (NH3) reacting to form nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).  Thus, the primary purpose of the ammonia is to contribute to the reduction of air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in a 15,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel (22' 6\" long by 10' 0\" diameter).  Ammonia vapor is withdrawn from the top of the vessel at a possible maximum rate of ~84 lb/hr.  It is then mixed with air and diluted to a concentration of less than 2% by volume before being fed into the turbine exhaust and then over the catalyst.  A small electric vaporizer adjace"

When the plant is operating intermittently as a cycling/peaking facility, the storage vessel is filled 3 times per year.  \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the Community; the Harbor Cogeneration Company Wilmington Plant has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make this type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the Company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analyses appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that overpredict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n - The HCC Wilmington Plant site is in a large industrial complex and relatively distant from populated neighborhoods or other potentially sensitive receptors.\n\n - The prevalent wind direction is not directly toward any potentially sensitive receptors.\n\n - The Ammonia Storage Vessel makes use of excess flow valves to minimize the amount of a potential release.\n\n - Firewater systems, firewater monitors, and Ammonia Stor"
