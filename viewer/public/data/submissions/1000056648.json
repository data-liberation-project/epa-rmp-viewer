The WTP treats water from McAlester Lake and sends water to its residents and several rural water districts. The facility stores and uses only 1 regulated chemical, anhydrous chlorine, in quantities higher than the threshold quantities.  The terms anhydrous chlorine and chlorine are used interchangeably and specially refer to a chemical listed in the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine is used in the chlorination process to disinfect water.  Chlorine is stored within a building in two 1-ton containers.  The total maximum intended inventory is 16,000 pounds.  The chlorine is liquefied under pressure in the containers.  Chlorine is drawn as a gas from the 1-ton containers through a vacuum feed system.  The gaseous chlorine is then metered into a solution through two chlorinators.  The chlorine solution is then fed to various chlorine feed points.  The facility is subject to the Occupational /Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and therefore, the chlorination process are subject to the Program 3 RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nMinimizing Risk\n\nThe major driving force in the development of the RMP regulations is reducing the risk to the public health by minimizing the potential of a chemical release.  The WTP has a multi-layer system in place to meet this goal.  The RMP includes the following:  (1) properly trained operators to safely handle chlorine; (2) leak detectors located where chlorine is stored and/or used; an (3) chemical release prevention and emergency response plans in place.  Trained personnel respond to alarms to assess whether a release poses an imminent danger to employees or the public.  While a significant release is unlikely, the emergency response plans have been developed for just such a significant release is unlikely, the emergency response plans have"

Overall development and management of the RMP is the responsibility of the RMP Manager.  The Project Manager is the designated RMP Manager.\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nAny accident releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage must be reported in the RMP submission to EPA.  Based upon interviews with plant operations, maintenance, safety, and training staff and management, no major chemical release has occurred at the WTP in the last five years.\n\n\n\nChemical Release Prevention Program\n\nThe WTP has a chemical release prevention program in place for the use of chlorine in the facilities chlorination processes, respectively.  Key provisions of the prevention program are as follows:\n\nWritten procedures have been prepared for the use of chlorine, including directions for safe startup, normal and shutdown operations and emergency shutdown.\n\nEmployees who operate the chlorination system must receive training initially and periodically on safe startup and shutdown operations and emergency shutdown.  Employee competency is evaluated annually by the project manager, regional H&S Advisor or other members of ST management.\n\nIncidences, including minor releases are investigated to improve the safety of the chlorination process.\n\nOnce completed, incident investigations are shared with employees.\n\nA process hazard analysis, which identified potential hazards and way to improve the safety of chlorination, is conducted every fiv"

Maintenance practices are consistent with guidance provided by the Chlorine Institute and Compressed Gas Association.  Preventative maintenance schedules are directed through the use of a computerized maintenance management system.\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every three years to evaluate the RMP and its implementation for compliance with EPA RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe WTP has an emergency response program in place.  This program consists of personnel trained to recognize releases, assess the situation and engage the proper emergency response personnel.  When external emergency response is required, WTP personnel will notify the City of McAlester Fire Department and / or Oklahoma State Police then establish an incident command system.  Incident command is transferred to the Fire Department or the Oklahoma State Police upon their arrival.  WTP personnel familiar with the chlorination process will remain on -site to assist the emergency response agencies if necessary.  The Fire Department and Oklahoma State Police have access to additional emergency response resources, including the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Highway and Transportation Department, Department of Health and the EPA. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
