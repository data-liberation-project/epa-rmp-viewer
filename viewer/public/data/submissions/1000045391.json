      "SummaryText": "eacting steam with light hydrocarbons (butane, LPG) in the presence of a catalyst.  In addition to the potential for combustion of the hydrogen and hydrocarbons, the methanation reaction to remove small amounts of CO and CO2 is highly exothermic and presents the possibility of a runaway reaction.  \r\n\r\n3.\tAsphalt Heating and Loading:  In 2006 the refinery suspended the process producing asphalt by air blowing in the Asphalt Manufacturing Unit (AMU).  The asphalt oxidizer (R801) as known as the air blower and the waste gas incinerator (H802) were taken out-of-service.  Aside from the asphalt loading rack which is used to fill trucks and inter-island container , there is a refinery fuel gas-fired heater which is used to keep asphalt warm so that is can be pumped and transferred.   \r\n\r\n4.\tCogeneration Unit:  The CGU consists of a combustion turbine power generating unit combined with a waste heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).  In addition to jet fuel the CGU was designed to and for a number of years was fired on light fuel such as naphtha and reformate. That practice was suspended in 2006. After completing a project to reduce risk associated with firing on light fuel, (and after substantial repairs were made to turbine) on May 29, 2011 the practice of firing naphtha (as the primary fuel) was resumed. The naphtha, which originates from the crude unit, passes through the northernmost of three pressurized horizontal tanks (Bullet 2301A). (The other two are currently empty)  The naphtha that passes through the bullet is first stabilized, and its initial boiler point (IBP) is more than 100 F, as verified by lab testing.  Consequently the naphtha which is stored in the bullet carries a NFPA fire rating of 3 and is not regulated as a flammable substance or mixture under 40 CFR 68. The cogeneration unit is also equipped with a duct burner which is fired exclusively on refinery fuel gas. Since there really is no storage of the refinery fuel gas prior to its use, the maximum i"

The naphtha and other light ends coming off the top of the atmospheric tower are covered by the RMP as a flammable mixture.  The hazards associated with the CDU include high temperature and pressure of the hydrocarbons, and chemicals such as caustic used to treat the kerosene.  The CDU also contains the sour water stripper (SWS).  Steam is used in the SWS to strip ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from water containing ammonium hydrosulfide.  The H2S and NH3 are sent to the Sulfur Recovery Units discussed below.\r\n\r\n3.\tVisbreaker and Offgas Hydrotreater:  The heavy residual oils from the bottom of the VDU tower are processed in the Visbreaker (VBK) by viscosity breaking at high temperature.  This results in breakdown of the heavy oil to produce fuel gas, naphtha and lighter oils.  The hazards associated with this process are again high temperature and pressure of the hydrocarbons, gases containing ~10% H2S. For the purposes of the RMP the greatest concern is with the release and subsequent ignition of flammable mixtures. The visbreaker offgas hydrotreater (VHT) is designed to convert organic sulfur compounds, produced by the VBK into H2S.  By permit condition the two units must be operated in conjunction with one another.\r\n\r\n4.\tDistillate Hydrocracker:  In the hydrocracker (DHC), gas oils from the CDU and VDU are mixed with hydrogen and sent to a series of catalytic reactors where nitrogen and sulfur are removed and the oils are cracked and reacted with hydrogen to form diesel, kerosene, naphtha and lighter gaseous products.  Some of the reactions in these reactors are exothermic and the potential exists for a runaway reaction.  Process controls minimize this possibility and provide for rapid pressure reduction by de-pressuring the reactors to the flare to protect against accidents.  Following the"

The flare system consists of the various flare headers throughout the process areas and two knockout drums.  The flare system transports gases from pressure safety relief valves to the flare for safe combustion.  There is little potential for fire or explosion because the flare operates at very low pressures and is itself a control device.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on engineering review, the seven processes listed below do not have flammable mixtures or contain toxic substances in excess of the threshold quantities established by 40 CFR 68. Although these processes are not specifically regulated under 40 CFR 68, the following processes, along with the rest of the refinery are managed according to the refinery's PSM program which embodies many of the same elements as RMP.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tSulfur Recovery Units/Tail Gas Unit:  The SRU receives acidic gases (NH3 and H2S) principally from the SWS and the ATU. The feed gases to the SRU are, for all practical purposes, void of hydrocarbon and generally are not characterized as a flammable mixture.   Ammonia is thermally decomposed and the H2S is converted to sulfur and removed.  The molten sulfur is condensed, prilled and sold.  The Sulfur Recovery Plant (SRP) also includes the Shell Claus Offgas Treater (SCOT) or Tail Gas Treating (TGU) is used to remove residual sulfur compounds from the flue or tail gas of the SRU.  A tail gas incinerator provides the final control.  Internal burners are fired on hydrogen and the incinerator is fired on refinery fuel gas.\r\n\r\n2.\tHydrogen Generating Unit:  A hydrogen plant produces hydrogen that is used primarily in the hydrocracker.

Most of the flammable substances, such as feedstocks, motor fuels and LPG are stored in the refinery's tank farm.  Other refinery processes have flammable substances held principally in process vessels and interconnecting piping.  The 8 refinery processes described below are subject to the containment and control measures mandated by the refinery's RMP for flammable mixtures.\r\n1.\tTank Farm:  The Tank Farm (TKF) contains many petroleum storage tanks,  including vertical tanks, pressurized horizontal tanks (bullets) and one sphere.  Stored products include crude oil, fuel oils, diesel, kerosene, gasoline, naphtha, , butane and propane. The amount of flammable substances subject to RMP was based on the tanks' capacity to store naphtha and liquefied petroleum gas LPG. The RMP flammable inventory excludes crude oil, gasoline and mixtures which are heavier than gasoline.  LPG, principally butane and propane, is stored in 8 pressurized tanks which have deluge systems in case of fire.  All vertical tanks are diked to contain releases.  Foam is also available for tank fires.     \r\n\r\n2.\tCrude Distillation and Vacuum Unit:  Crude oil is washed to remove salt, heated and then distilled in the  atmospheric distillation tower  referred to as the crude distillation unit (CDU) into naphtha, kerosene, diesel, atmospheric gas oils (middle distillates), and residual oil .

This second alternative case was represented by a two inch hole or line connection from a 30,000 gallon propane (C3) bullet also located in the LPG storage area, if filled to 85.5% (safe fill level).   Utilizing a combination EPA Offsite Consequences Analysis calculation and the Aloha model (which is endorsed by the EPA), the vapor cloud is expected to be blown (by winds which are assumed to be 3 meters per second) 402 feet from the point of release .  Subsequent ignition and explosion of the cloud could cause an impact an additional 477 feet away.  Consequently the total hazard distance for the alternative case was estimated at 879 ft (0.17 miles).    \r\n\r\nThe Third Alternative Case:  At recommendation of a third party auditor a third alternative case was analyzed based on the possibility of a release for a pressurized tanker truck while parked or offloading in the propane load rack. The PLR is at the south eastern edge of the facilities property line.  To conservatively determine the worst case in the event of propane from this location, the entire 100 bbl pressurized tanker truck or container, if filled to 85.5% (safe fill level), was assumed to be release and ignite and create a VCE.   Under this scenario the total hazard distance associated with a 1 psi over-pressurization would be 703 feet or 0.13 miles.   Even though the propane load rack is closer to the property line, there would be no residence or sensitive receptors impacted by the VCE . \r\n\r\nNote: All of eight the bullets in the tank farm are approximately the same  (30,000 gallons or slightly less).

The PSM program applies to the entire refinery, and is not limited to processes that contain a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS) are completed by professionals on all refinery processes and repeated every five years as a minimum.  This assures that design standards are adequate for safe operation, and that controls are installed and address all identified hazards. Note that the great majority of actions identified in the HAZOP are addressed as quickly as practicable.  Some items however require long lead times due to design requirements or other work necessary to determine a solution.  Management of Change (MOC) procedures and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) ensure that any change in materials, equipment or procedures is thoroughly reviewed for safety and risk.  A mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment is maintained, inspected and tested using manufacturers and industry standards.  Accidents and near misses are subject to an incident investigation process that ensures actions are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.\r\n\r\nThis RMP submittal asks for a number of dates to show compliance with various elements of the prevention program.

The HGU was unexpectedly shutdown when surplus hydrogen was relieved to the fuel gas system, activating a high fuel-gas pressure shutdown of the hydrogen reformer furnace (H2001).  Non-hazardous amine and steam were vented to atmosphere from the CO2 stripper, when the HGU shutdown.

Potentially flammable hydrocarbon vapors contained in the head space of various tanks and vessels in the WTU are routed to a closed vent system and in a thermal oxidizer.     The potential for vapors and the flammability risk is limited because the CO2 or nitrogen are normally introduced into the head space to provide an inert gas blanket.
