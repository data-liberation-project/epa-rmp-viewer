This Executive Summary includes a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n2. Stationary source activities\n\n3. Regulated substances handled\n\n4. Release scenario analysis\n\n5. Accidental release prevention program\n\n6. Five-year accident history\n\n7. Emergency response preparedness program\n\n8. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n9. Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nIt is General Mills' policy to comply with all of the requirements of the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation as well as all other applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Cedar Rapids Plant has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Manual that documents safety and risk management policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response preparedness.  In addition to the PSM Manual, the Cedar Rapids Plant has developed a Risk Management Program that includes the OSHA PSM elements, a description of the risk management system, an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the five-year accident history. \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source Activities\n\n\n\nThe Cedar Rapids Plant is located in Linn County, Iowa.  The facility produces food products including cereal, frosting, and fruit snack products.  Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration for process area air conditioning, process cooling, and refrigerated storage.  Secondary coolants (propylene glycol and water) are used.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the Cedar Rapids facility consists of three separate engine rooms or processes that are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule.  All three ammonia refrigeration systems are closed-loop processes w"

The systems consist of vessels, compressors, chillers, evaporators, condensers, safety relief systems, ammonia detectors and alarms.  All leaks are addressed and the system charges are maintained at intended levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  Release Scenario Analysis\n\n\n\nRelease scenarios were analyzed using the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (May 1996), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration (1998) and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November 1998).  A worst-case release scenario was defined to determine the potential emergency response procedures needed for the facility and community; however, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant.  On the other hand, the alternative release scenarios are based on credible assumptions.  The alternative scenario was selected from a number of possible scenarios from the Ammonia Model RMP and is representative of a pipe, valve or flange gasket leak or a pump seal leak.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.  Prevention Programs\n\n\n\nFor the Cedar Rapids Plant ammonia systems, General Mills followed the ANSI/IIAR Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems and implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur.  Some of the key elements of the Prevention Program are summarized below. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) - A comprehensive set of process safety information has"

The PSI includes data on the chemicals, the equipment design and the technology of the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) - An initial PHA was conducted to satisfy the PSM requirements in 1998. The hazard analysis of the ammonia process is re-validated at least every 5-years. Recommendations made by the most recent PHA team to improve the safety of the systems have been addressed to further reduce the risk of an accidental release or incident  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - An Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operating procedures for the ammonia systems and for safe work practices.  Safe work practices include the use of ammonia personal protective equipment, lockout/tagout procedures, confined space entry procedures, safe use of motorized vehicles around ammonia equipment, and access control to critical areas.  Operating procedures are reviewed and re-certified annually to make sure they are current.\n\n\n\nTraining -- Training is provided to each ammonia system operator before they operate the system.  The company follows IIAR guidance for ammonia operator training and certification which includes intial and refresher training.\n\n\n\nMaintenance - All of the covered ammonia equipment is included in the Cedar Rapids preventive maintenance program.  Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed following a structured schedule according to IIAR Guidelines and a company developed mechanical integrity program.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - An MOC procedure is followed for all changes made to the ammonia systems, including the safety systems, to ensure that the system safety and integrity are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSR) - Pre-startup reviews are conducted whenever a change results in a change to the PSI.  Checklists are used to direct the PSR process.  The checklists are used to ensure that all essential elements of the prevention program (i.e., engin"

The most recent audit was completed in September 2017 and findings and recommendations for improvement have been addressed.  All findings from earlier audits have also been addressed.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - General Mills routinely investigates any ammonia related incident or accident that occurs at the Cedar Rapids Plant.  An Incident Investigation procedure has been developed to help the investigation team determine the root cause of an incident and to help them develop measures to prevent recurrence. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - An employee participation program (for safety and risk management) is in place and training in PSM has been conducted for all affected employees.  Employee involvement in PHA studies and review of operating procedures is an important way in which employees take and retain ownership of the risk management programs. \n\n\n\nHot Work Permit Program - A hot work permit program is being used at the Cedar Rapids Plant whenever hot work is conducted in and around the ammonia systems. \n\n\n\nContractor Safety - Contractor safety procedures are in place and include reviews of contractor performance and the inclusion of safety performance and programs in selecting contractors for work on or adjacent to the ammonia processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been no release of ammonia from the Cedar Rapids Plant in the last five years that meets the RMP reporting criteria. \n\n\n\n\n\n7. Emergency Response Preparedness Plan\n\n\n\nThe Cedar Rapids Plant has an emergency response preparedness program which is described in the site Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  This plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying response agencies and adjacent businesses, and procedures for responding to any release that may occur.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for toxic expo"

The ERP is coordinated with the Cedar Rapids Fire Department and the Linn County Emergency Management Agency and consistent with the county hazmat response plan.   The facility conducts annual drills with community first responders.\n\n\n\nThe facility has conducted risk management plan communication meetings with employees and has notified immediate offsite receptors.  A public communications meeting was held in June, 1999 in cooperation with the Cedar Rapids Fire Department, the Linn County Emergency Management Agency, and other industries in the area with PSM/RMP covered chemicals.\n\n\n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAll recommendations from PHAs, MOCs, PSRs, mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigations, and compliance audits are addressed on an on-going basis.  It is also General Mills' policy to review operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure they are always applicable and effective.  This continuous review process generates further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operations and these measures are typically addressed in a very short time frame. \n\n\n\n9. Summary\n\n\n\nThe design, operation and maintenance of the ammonia system according to IIAR Standards and Guidelines and the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of ammonia are being managed in an appropriate manner.  The likelihood of a release is minimized through the implementation of these programs.  General Mills has developed an Emergency Response Plan which is coordinated through the local response agencies and has communicated the information in this Risk Management Plan to the local community.
