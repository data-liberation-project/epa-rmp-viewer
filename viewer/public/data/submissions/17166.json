Plant #1 is located at 982 North 5th Highway in Lansing KS. and Plant #2 is located at 1220 North 2nd Street in Leavenworth, KS.\n\nPlant #1 has 16,000 pounds of Chlorine capacity at any given time.  These are in 2,000 pounds cyclinders with only one cyclinder being in the process at a time with a back-up cyclinder.\n\nPlant #2 has 12,000 pounds of Chlorine capacity at any given time.  These are stored in 2,000 pounds cyclinders again with only one cyclinder being in the process at a time with a back-up cyclinder in the process hook-up\n\nOur worst case scenario would be of a release of 16,000 pounds of Chlorine at Plant #1 or 12,000 pounds of Chlorine at Plant #2 from the result of an unknown catastrophy or fire within the facilities.  If this would be the case we would activate our emergency response plan that would notify the Fire Department of the City of Leavenworth.  They in turn would respond to the facility and contain the release and help with the evacuation of residences and businesses within the end point of each facility.\n\nPlant manager would then notify Environmental Technology and Services of St. Joseph, Missouri to respond to the plant to mitigate the release.\n\nHowever, our most likely type of release would consist of <2,000 pounds of Chlorine.  This would be the result of equipment failure.  Again the Fire Department and Environmental Technology and Services would be notified to mitigate release.\n\nWe here at Leavenworth Water Works train our personnel annually to the level of being First Responders Operational Level in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\nWe also, review our emergency, safety and health programs annually to update and train our employees.\n\nWithin the past five (5) years, the City of Leavenworth Water Works has never had or reported a release of Chlor"
