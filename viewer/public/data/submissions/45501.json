The risk management program is to be described in a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is registered with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and made available to the public.  At General Chemical Newark Works, two extraordinarily hazardous substances (EHSs) are managed in quantities greater than the threshold quantity.  The chemicals are Oleum (20-27%) and Sulfur Trioxide gas which is generated as an intermediate that is immediately used in another section of the system to produce Sulfuric Acid.\n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:31-7.1, which provides a format for a written RMP.\n\nThis previous RMP update and updated off-site consequence analysis, were submitted to reflect the discontinued production and use of 65% Oleum and 98% Nitric Acid from our property.\nThis update includes revised Contact information and Worst Case Scenario information\nA hazard assessment was completed consisting of a new worst case release scenario and alternative case release scenarios.  The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40CFR part 68 Subpart B (68.20-68.42) (incorporated by reference into N.J.A.C. 7:31), as well as guidance provided by the USEPA?s Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAs part of General Chemical, Newark Works is committed to being a responsible member of the community.

Methods of minimizing or reusing wastes, in addition to using energy and materials wisely are encouraged.  A key element of the General Chemical Health, Safety and Environmental Policy is fostering openness through dialogue with employees and the public.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We pay close attention to those chemicals which OSHA and the EPA identify as hazardous substances.  Our policy is to conform to all applicable laws and regulations, as well as codes and recommended practices to ensure the safety of the public and the environment.  We use accidental release prevention programs to make sure our processes are managed safely.  We also prepared for potential emergencies to protect employees and the public in the event of a chemical release.\n\nSafety is an important issue at Newark Works.  Monthly meetings are held with plant employees to address environmental and safety issues.  The plant also has regular audits, which are conducted by internal employees and corporate audit teams.  The recommendations obtained through these audits are used to improve the environmental health and safety status at Newark Works.\n\nIn addition to internal audits, the plant is inspected regularly by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection for compliance with the state of New Jersey?s Toxic Catastrophe Protection Act regulatory requirements.  These inspections have occurred annually since 1986 when the regulation became effective.\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this facility, Sulfur is burned to form Sulfur Dioxide, which is reacted with air in catalytic converters to form Sulfur Trioxide.  The Sulfur Trioxide is then hydrated to form Sulfuric Acid and Oleum in absorption towers.   The Sulfuric Acid is cooled"

An abatement system downstream of the absorption towers maintains facility emissions within permitted limits.  The quantities of these chemicals maintained on site are as follows:  27% Oleum/2,000,000 pounds and Sulfur \n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical ? Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe maintain a significant safety program to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operations for our processes.  The accident prevention program implemented at Newark Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the RMP regulation including:\n\n? Process Safety Information ? Information relating to he hazards of the chemical, process technology and equipment information are maintained to ensure proper operation.\n? Mechanical Integrity ? Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment on site.\n? Process Hazard Analysis ? Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the operating conditions.\n? Annual Safety Review ? All procedures associated with the TCPA program are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure proper information and direction is provided for employees.\n? Standard Operating Procedures ? Detailed procedures are in place identifying actions necessary for multiple phases of operation, operating limits and safety considerations.\n? Employee Participation ? Employees at all levels are involved in key roles of the release prevention program.\n? Training ? Employees in the operating process are trained in detail o ensure proper operation of the plant.\n? Management of Change ? Process parameters are maintained through a management of change system which documents the changes as well s evaluates changes for sa"

Significant changes to the processes are evaluated in detail to verify the proper construction, operating procedures, emergency procedures and safety are addressed prior to operation.\n? Incident Investigation ? All incidents are investigated to ensure proper modifications are made to reduce or eliminate the potential for re-occurrence. \n? Hot Work Permits ? All hot work on site is monitored through a hot work permit system to reduce the potential of on-site fires.\n? Contractor Safety ? Contractors are evaluated and trained prior to performing work on site to reduce the potential of on-site fires.\n? Compliance Audits ? Audits are performed at a minimum of three year intervals to verify procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.\n? Emergency Response ? Plans are made with the community emergency response groups as well as onsite emergency response teams to ensure procedures are in place in case an emergency situation occurs.\n\nThe regulated toxic chemicals are managed on site with the following release prevention steps:\n3.1 Oleum\n\n? Routine inspection and testing of process equipment\n? Process monitored at all times\n? Process shut-down systems to control process upsets\n? Check valves to control Oleum flow\n? Alarms to assist Operators in process control\n? Secondary containment\n? Scrubbers to control emissions\n? Neutralization for spills\n? Compliance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule\n\n4.0 The Five Year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  No accidents have occurred during the past five years which involve the release of an extremely hazardous substance causing on-site deaths, injuries or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelter in place.\n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan which consolidates all of the var"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinated our plan with the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n6.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe General Chemical Newark Works facility has been in the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act program since 1986.  This has required the plant to go through detailed hazard reviews since this time for each process identified in the program.  We have successfully implemented the recommendations identified during these reviews.   The plant continues to operate using the release prevention program implemented at the site as identified above.  Newark Works is currently implementing the rigorous QS-9002 standard and continues to optimize plant equipment through the use of a productive maintenance program"
