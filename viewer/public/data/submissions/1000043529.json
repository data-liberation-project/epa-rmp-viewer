Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n\r\nHarcros Chemicals Inc. is committed to the safe operation of its plants for our employees, the public, and the environment.  We have demonstrated this commitment through a system of management practices, which help to ensure safe operations at this facility.  The Risk Management Program is a part of our system, which helps us manage risks.  The requirements of the Risk Management Program can be found in the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program (the RMP Rule).  \r\n\r\nAt this facility, we handle ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, which are hazardous substances.  The same properties that make ethylene oxide and propylene oxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.  Harcros Chemicals implements controls to help prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  If a release were to occur, we will determine for each situation whether evacuation of our employees is required.  Public and private response agencies will be notified and we will assist them in their response activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nEthylene oxide and propylene oxide are received by rail car.  The chemicals are transferred to reactors where they are consumed in the process to make less hazardous product"

The use of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide in this process are subject to RMP Program Level 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The process that uses ethylene oxide and propylene oxide is not only subject to the Risk Management Program Rule but is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The following addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nHarcros Chemicals encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Employee participation ranges from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as members of a process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Information created as part of our plant accident prevention program is available to all employees.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nHarcros Chemicals maintains a variety of technical documents and information concerning process chemicals and equipment, which is essential to an effective process safety management program and to process hazard analyses.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response, is included in Material Safety Data Sheets (i.e. Safety Data Sheets).

The emergency response program\r\n\r\nThis facility does not have an emergency response plan.  Trained public and private emergency response personnel will handle any incident determined to be an emergency.  Employees of Harcros Chemicals will be available to assist responders.  Our Emergency Action Plan has detailed information on actions employees are to take in event of an emergency.  These actions include evacuation procedures, emergency alarms, on-site emergency equipment available, and phone numbers of public and private emergency responders.  The Emergency Action Plan is reviewed and updated every year. \r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nHarcros Chemicals strives to improve safety of our processes through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.  The only specific safety improvement currently planned is the modernization of the rail spur used for ethylene oxide and propylene oxide rail cars."

The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nHarcros Chemicals has practices and written procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.  Maintenance employees involved in maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment are provided an overview of the process and its hazards.  Training is also provided in the procedures applicable to employees' job tasks to assure employees can perform tasks in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practice\r\nHarcros Chemicals has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of entry and exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of residual ethylene oxide and propylene oxide before equipment is opened, (4) a permit procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit procedure to ensure adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

Incident investigations are initiated as soon as possible after the incident but no later than 48 hours after the incident.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team consists of persons knowledgeable of the process and other persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  Responsibilities are assigned to assure recommendations developed to address investigation findings are followed through and documented.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help assure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.
