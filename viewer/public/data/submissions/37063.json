      "SummaryText": "The Cobb County Water system strives to make their operations safe, not only for it's employee's, but for it's neigbors and customers as well. In compliance with the RMP rule Cobb County has evaluated and set in place emergency management procedures for the use of Chlorine at the Robert L. Sutton Water Reclamation Facility (WRF). The Robert L. Sutton WRF is located in Cobb County, Georgia in the City of Smyrna. The tertiary, forty million gallon per day wastewater facility is part of the Cobb County Water System and administered by the Water Protection Division. Large quantities of chlorine are used by the R.L. Sutton facility for treatment and disinfection of wastewater.  In January of 1999, Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. performed a Chlorine Hazard Assessment for the Cobb County Water System to review planning and safety procedures and determine toxic end points for worse-case and alternative scenarios.\nThe Robert L. Sutton WRF uses chlorine solution to disinfect wastewater effluent before surface discharge to Chattahoochee River. The chlorination facility at this plant uses ton containers to provide chlorine gas for the disinfection process. \nAtmospheric dispersion modeling using the risk management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40CFR Part 68) prepared by the US Environmental Protection Agency, October 27 1998, was used to determine the toxic endpoint of the release. \nAir sampling detectors are located at all the chlorine handling locations and will alarm if atmospheric chlorine concentrations exceed 3 ppm. Training in handling safe procedures is performed once a year by the chemical supplier and occurs once a year.  SCBA training occurs once a year and is conducted by the Water Protection Safety Coordinator. Ton container repair kits are located at all the Cobb County WRFs.\nNo accidental chlorine releases have occurred at this facility in the past five years. \nWritten procedures are posted in the case of an emergency."
