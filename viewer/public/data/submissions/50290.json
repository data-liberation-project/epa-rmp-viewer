Regulated Substance(s)\n\nThe substance(s) that are routinely stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia at or above the threshold level for the RMP. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed to area fertilizer suppliers and/or farms as a source of land applied Nitrogen fertilizer, or could be distributed to industrial use customers. \n\nMaximum Quantity Stored at this site is 101,000,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in two 9,708,738-gallon atmospheric storage tank(s). The maximum quantity handled would be 50,500,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\n4.  Accidental Release Program\n         \nThis Anhydrous ammonia facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) program is one part of the comprehensive loss prevention and control system implemented at this facility. The implementation of PSM, Administrative Procedures, and Safe Work Practices represent the facility's main active elements of the accidental release prevention program.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nTwo reportable incidents have occurred in the last five years at the facility.  On March 8, 2003 an operator was inspecting a leaking valve on a tank truck when the truck driver inadvertently opened the valve.  The operator was exposed to ammonia vapor, and sustained chemical burns to his mouth, throat, and nasal passages.  He was hospitalized overnight and released the following day.  This was the first lost time accident at this facility in over 15 years.    \n\nOn June 30, 2007 ammonia gas was released at the"

      "SummaryText": "start of a ship off-load and caused employees at a neighboring facility to shelter in place.  The ammonia load arm had been connected to a ship, and liquid ammonia was being introduced into the load arm to cool it down before the off-load.  Liquid ammonia leaked out of a failed seal in a load arm swivel joint and evaporated.  The leak was discovered after about 15 minutes, and the cool-down was then terminated.  According to witnesses, the release generated brief and mild odor on the Simplot side of the fence.  However, some employees at Evraz Oregon Steel, the neighboring facility to the north, experienced eye irritation, and about 80 employees left the production area and sheltered in place for about 90 minutes.  No recordable injuries were reported.  \n\nAs a result of this incident, the terminal emergency response plan was updated with a better emergency phone number for Evraz.  Also, additional maintenance is being conducted on the marine arm, even though existing maintenance frequencies and procedures met or exceeded manufacturer recommendations.  The additional maintenance procedure is to move the marine arm and swivel joints approximately every month. Fewer ammonia ships have visited the terminal in recent years than in the past, and one consideration is that long periods of inactivity could result in adhesion of the swivel joint seals to the sealing surfaces.  If the seals are adhered to the sealing surfaces, they can tear and cause leaks when the arm is moved.  Moving the joints on a more frequent basis will spread the lubricant around, and should prevent seal adhesion, tears, and leaks. \n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194, and 33CFR 127."

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic.  As this is an ongoing process, improvements are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections, incident investigations, and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."
