This Plan has \n\nbeen developed in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part \n\n68, ?Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions?.  The purpose of these provisions and \n\nthis RMP is to prevent accidental releases of toxic and flammable substances that can \n\ncause harm to the public and to the environment.\n\n\n\nThis RMP was originally developed by Triton Environmental, Inc. on behalf of Global \n\nspecifically to prevent and mitigate accidental releases associated with butane storage \n\n(temporary storage) and handling operations at the Revere facility.  The RMP provides \n\na summary of the risk management program implemented at the Terminal and was \n\ndeveloped following the Environmental Protection Agency?s ?Risk Management \n\nProgram Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities (40 CFR 68)?.  The RMP is available \n\nto government agencies and the public for review.\n\n\n\nTighe & Bond has performed the requisite review and regulatory update necessary for \n\ncovered facilities on their five year RMP Submission Anniversary.  This review \n\nincluded:\n\n\n\n*    A hazard analysis of the covered process using a methodology involving \n\nchecklists developed from EPA RMP Guidance and NFPA 58, as well as a \n\nphysical inspection of the covered process;\n\n*    \n\n*    Performance of an off site consequence analysis (OCA) taking into account data \n\nrevised from the year 2000 census; and\n\n*    \n\n*    A general review of operating and maintenance procedures with facility \n\noperations and environmental personnel.\n\n*    \n\nThis Plan has been designed to serve as a ?stand alone? document, as well as, to be \n\npart of the Terminal?s Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).\n\n\n\nThe following items provide and overview of Global?s RMP, in accordance with 40 \n\nCFR 68.155.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Covered Process\n\n\n\nGlobal operates a marine petroleum te"

The terminal can be segregated into three operating areas; \n\nvessel dock, tank farm and loading rack.\n\n\n\nThe various products are off-loaded from marine vessels at the dock.  This dock is \n\nprovided with cranes to maneuver transfer hoses, mooring line connections and \n\nbreasting dolphins.  The docks have the necessary gauges to monitor transfer operation \n\nand drip pans to capture small spills.  Each dock is provided with a dock house to \n\nprotect employees from the elements during dock operations.\n\n\n\nProducts may also be transferred to bulk storage tanks via a truck pump-off station.  A \n\nnumber of smaller additive and dye tanks at the terminal are filled directly from tanker \n\ntrucks.\n\n\n\nDistribution piping is used to transfer the product off-loaded from marine vessels to \n\nabove ground storage tanks located in a segregated tank farm area.  Materials are \n\ntransferred to the tank farm using pumps supplied on the transporting vessel.  Dock \n\npiping and the majority of piping in the tank farm areas are located above ground.\n\n\n\nProducts are transferred for sale to a truck loading rack or shoreline pumping station.  \n\nThis terminal also has the capability of transferring product to other terminals via intra-\n\nfacility piping.  Pumping to these locations is performed by inter-facility pumps through \n\npredominantly above ground piping.\n\n\n\nThe covered process at the terminal involves blending butane with gasoline in a \n\ncontrolled enclosed system.  Butane blending occurs in a designated area of the facility \n\nnear the terminal office building.  The system incorporates a 100 gallon storage tank, \n\nloading towers, an indirect bath vaporizer, blending system and associated piping \n\nsystems.\n\n\n\nButane stock is temporarily stored at the facility in two rail cars with a maximum \n\ncapacity of 144,738 pounds per rai"

The system was shut down, purged with nitrogen and all unloading \n\nconnections were capped in September 2001.  However, butane blending operations \n\nmay commence at any time in the future, which necessitates this program and \n\npredictive filing.\n\n\n\nIn the event that this process operation was to continue, a detailed engineering review \n\nand maintenance inspection of the covered process would be performed prior to starting \n\nblending operations.
