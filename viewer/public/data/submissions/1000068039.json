      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Poet Biorefining-Big Stone facility is located approximately 2 miles west of Big Stone City, South Dakota. Poet Biorefining-Big Stone's main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel. Production at the facility began in January 2002. Poet Biorefining-Big Stone produces ethanol using the dry mill method. Corn meal is mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce fermentable sugars. Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol. The fermented mash (beer) contains up to 20% alcohol and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous Ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in three storage tanks.  The denaturant is then blended inline, as it is being loaded, with the 200 proof anhydrous Ethanol making it unfit for human consumption and completing the process.  The inline blending process is conducted with set parameters to meet State and Federal requirements for Standard 200 Proof Ethanol and E85 shipments. The denaturant is natural gas condensate (NGC).  The NGC is stored in two storage tanks.  \n\n\n\nChemicals Regulated Under EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program\n\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation. The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage tank, and the associated blending/transfer equipment and piping. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policy and Program\n\nPoet Biorefining-Big Stone is committed to the protection of it employees, the surrounding community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. In the event of an emergency, Poet Biorefining-Big Stone's Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or th"

Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety. In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of Poet Biorefining-Big Stone to notify the Big Stone City Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPoet Biorefining-Big Stone is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation. Public access to the facility from the highway is restricted by a gate. Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access. The plant is fully lit. Personnel are on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based alarm system. The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors). The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms. All of the facility storage tanks have secondary storage containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\n\n\nIn addition to these physical features, Poet's prevention program includes process safety information (Safety Data Sheets, regulated substance inventory, and equipment and process specifications), periodic reviews, written operating procedures consistent with safety information, training, maintenance schedules and procedures, and compliance audits.  \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has an excellent record with regard to minimizing recordable and reportable accidents. There have been no incidents since startup of the facility that require inclusion in the five-year accident history re"

New computer based maintenance software (Maximo) has been implemented, this includes more detailed automatic scheduling and work order generation for all preventative maintenance inspections and tests.\n\n"
