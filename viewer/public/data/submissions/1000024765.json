      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\nThe Rancho California Water District (RCWD) Santa Rosa Water Reclamation Facility is located in Murrieta in Riverside County, California. The facility includes chlorine use for disinfection, and sulfur dioxide for removal of chlorine residual. \r\nThe chlorine system consists of the chlorine bulk storage system, chlorinators, chlorine rapid mix basins, and chlorine contact basins. Chlorine is stored onsite in sixteen, one-ton cylinders (8 duty, 8 standby).  During normal operations, chlorine is withdrawn from the cylinders and the gaseous chlorine is fed by chlorinators to injectors which mix chlorine with water, forming a solution.  The RCWD water department also stores a maximum of 60 @ 150 pound cylinders in the chlorine room which are for use at RCWD well sites and pump stations throughout the district area.  \r\nThe dechlorination system consists of sulfur dioxide storage and sulfonators. The sulfur dioxide storage consists of eight, one-ton cylinders (4 duty, 4 standby) located inside the chlorination/dechlorination building.\r\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored separately; each in a separate, 28ft by 44ft storage room of the masonry block Disinfection Building.\r\nA scrubber system is available to treat releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\nChemicals Subject to USEPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)\r\nRCWD uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Santa Rosa Water Reclamation Facility (SRWRF) in quantities large enough to trigger the USEPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) and California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  The USEPA RMP threshold quantities for chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.  The CalARP threshold quantities for chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are 100 pounds and 500 pounds, respectively.  The maximum quantities present are 41,000 pounds of chlorine and 16,"

There are also 150 pound cylinders stored in the chlorine room for RCWD water department use.\r\nThe RCWD Santa Rosa Water Reclamation Facility also is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with chlorine storage and disinfection systems, and sulfur dioxide storage and dechlorination processes.  The threshold quantities under PSM for chlorine and sulfur dioxide are 1,500 pounds and 1,000 pounds, respectively.\r\n\r\nAccidental Releases During Past Five Years\r\nThe RCWD Santa Rosa Water Reclamation Facility has not had any releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.  \r\nRCWD's RMP programs include the following to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\r\n\u00bf\tReview of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine storage and disinfection systems, and dechlorination systems, to verify that they are properly designed and installed.\r\n\u00bf\tUpdating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures. All procedures are reviewed and certified annually.\r\n\u00bf\tInitial safety training and 3-year refresher training is provided for all operators and maintenance staff.\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures to provide safety information to all contractors.\r\n\u00bf\tRegular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, including documentation of all inspections.\r\n\u00bf\tPrompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\r\n\u00bf\tSafety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\r\n\u00bf\tInvestigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases.\r\n\u00bf\tPeriodic evaluation of the safety records of all outside contractors who work on the RMP-regul"

In the unlikely event of an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, the key elements of RCWD's emergency response program are as follows:\r\n\u00bf\tAll plant staff members (including administrative and clerical staff) are trained in the specific elements of the program.\r\n\u00bf\tA team of supervisors and operators are trained, certified and equipped for hazardous materials (HAZMAT) emergency operations to repair accidental releases.\r\n\u00bf\tThe plant uses a combination of visual and audible alarms and a plant loudspeaker system to alert the staff of a potential accident and to conduct in-plant communications.\r\n\u00bf\tIn the event of a large release, the facility would immediately contact a telephone call-down list that includes the Riverside County Fire Department, and several nearby commercial establishments that could be affected if the wind were blowing toward them during the release.\r\n\r\nSafety Improvements\r\nRCWD will continue to improve safety by continually updating process safety information, providing employee training, annually reviewing operating procedures & emergency response plan, encouraging employee participation and incorporating system improvements identified during scheduled hazard reviews.  \r\nBased on safety reviews that were conducted as part of the 1999 RMP implementation, RCWD has completed the following actions to either reduce the likelihood or severity of potential chemical releases:\r\n\u00bf\tInstalled USFilter scrubber with a treatment capacity of 9,400 pounds in August 1999 to handle chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide releases.\r\n\u00bf\tEstablished an annual contract"

As a result, important safety activities, such as emergency eyewash/shower flushing, are scheduled and reminders are provided to operators.\r\nBased on the 2011 SRWRF RMP 5-Year Update, the proposed safety improvements for the SRWRF chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems processes involve the following:\r\n\u00bf\tTo better prepare RCWD operators who attend the deliveries and minimize potential leaks/spills during delivery, the Standard Operating Procedures of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide suppliers will be requested for review.\r\n\u00bf\tWith the intent to minimize health risks during 1-ton container change-out or maintenance, it is emphad that RCWD operators should continue the current practice where 1 operator inside uses a full face air purifying respirator and 1 operator stands by outside with a SCBA ready for rescue. \r\n\u00bf\tIn an effort to make sure proposed system changes are necessary, safely implemented and well documented to others, RCWD should continue to remind operators to perform Management of Change reviews, and, if system changes are approved, Pre-startup Safety Review forms are to be filled out and the Operating Procedures, P&IDs etc must be updated.\r\n\u00bf\tRCWD SRWRF operators will be informed that, in addition to the RMP, the RMP Manager maintains a separate binder that includes key RMP issues, such as the list of PHA and audit recommendations and implementation schedules, up-to-date process flow diagrams, and current material data safety sheets for quick reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity Improvements\r\nThe typical security measures at the SRWRF site include the perimeter fence, staff-controlled electric entrance & exit gates and lighting. Recently, RCWD installed locks on the Disinfection Building doors that require specifically programmed cyber keys to access the chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The cyber key system allows RCWD to track which key opens the gate/doors and when the lock is activated."
