The first is in a series of   8 \u00bd X 11 inch 3 ring binders which have been issued to all managers.  The second is a pocket size version of the same procedures which has been issued to all employees. These were revised and reissued in 2005.\n\nThese procedures are behavior based and include scheduled (weekly) safety meetings, required supervisor safety observations and periodic documented process inspections. (See section c)\n\nThe safety meetings are used to review and train employees on specific policies. They are also used as a means to review the results of supervisor observations during the last period.\n\nThere are several levels of emergency responses. They range from individual employees using established Standard Operating Procedures (SOP\u00bfs) to mitigate the situation all they way to a full evacuation of the facility and calling on community based emergency responder to resolve the problem. (See section \u00bfE\u00bf for details).\n\n\nb.The substance handled\n\nThe substance is anhydrous ammonia\nCAS number 7664-41-7\nThere is 75,000 lbs. stored in 2 inter connected tanks\n(See also section c)\n\nc.The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe site operates seasonally from late spring through late winter. Shut down of the facility is usually in May & June.\n\nThe process starts when grapes are received and sent to a series of refrigerated coolers using ammonia as a refrigerant.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program begins with a pre-start up, operational inspection of the entire refrigeration system. This is a documented inspection performed by both an outside refrigeration contractor (Industrial Refrigeration, Exeter, CA) and the Delano Farms refrigeration operator. (See also post operation review). Any operational deficiencies are corrected prior to start up of the system.\n\nThe next"

These are documented using an inspection checklist.\n\nThe last step involves a post operational review after shut down. This is also a documented inspection but this one is only performed by the Delano Farms refrigeration operator.\n\nAll system components have been identified, using the piping and instrument drawings (P & I D) and have been individually tagged. All components were assessed by a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team. \n\nThe PHA team assigned a numeric/alpha risk factor to each component. The numeric rating looked at the component\u00bfs likelihood of failure and the alpha character rates the consequences of that component\u00bfs failure.\n\nFrom this rating system SOP\u00bfs were developed that will isolate each component in the event of failure. (see also section e) In the event of a component failure during the operating season that results in an accidental release of ammonia, designated employees will follow these SOP\u00bfs to minimize any release (Except for the \u00bfWorse Case Scenario\u00bf) These SOP\u00bfs have been filed in the P & I D binders.\n\nE. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated toxic substance being held at the facility above the threshold quantity. It is received in two separate but interconnected tanks with a maximum capacity in both tanks of 75,000 lbs.\n\nDuring normal operations, each tank contains about 10,000 lbs with the remainder being used somwhere else in the system. When the plant shuts down seasonally, the system is Pumped down and all the ammonia is returned to the two main receivers. At this time, the two tanks are at or near maximum capacity.  The two King valves are closed and the tanks are no longer interconnected.\n\nThis worse case scenario is based on a catestrophic failure of either tank during this phase when the tank would be at or near capacity. In this case, the entire 35,000 lbs would be released, as a liqui"
