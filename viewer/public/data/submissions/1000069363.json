Skyland Grain, LLC strives to maintain a safe and healthy work place. Our owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nSkyland Grain, LLC maintains and operates their Anhydrous Ammonia Plant in strict accordance with all state and local authorities.  Our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. In addition, Senior Management reviews the status of each facility and institutes changes to make the facility safer. \n\n\n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site-specific operating procedures, plant maintenance and employees are competency tested over the training material. Each employee uses ammonia proof goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of emergency safety water during nurse tank and maintenance operations.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, we had an incident.  \n\n\n\nSkyland Grain, LLC.'s anhydrous ammonia program is designed to minimize risk to employees, any first responders, and the surrounding public.  In addition, our program is designed to consult and coordinate response needs with the local emergency planning and response organizations and make sure they are aware of the hazards of anhydrous ammonia.  Part of this coordination is discussing Skyland Grain, LLC.'s emergency action plan, their emergency contact information, and any other information that local emergency planning and response organizations identify as relevant to local emergency response planning.\n\n"
