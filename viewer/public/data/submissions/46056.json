      "SummaryText": "The owners, management and employees of Moultrie Grain Association are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and LEPC so they can p;lan for response to any release and minimize the impact.\n\nAt this facility, anhydrous ammonia is received by rail and distributed for use as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 400,000 lbs.  \n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 400,000 lbs which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity.  The distance to endpoint is approximately 6 miles.\n\nThe alternate case scenario would be a release from the rupture of the 3 inch transfer hose with 26,000 lbs released over 2 minutes.  The distance to endpoint is 1.5 miles.\n\nThis facility compolies with the rules and regulations related to the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions as administered by the IL Departemtn of Agriculture.  These rules are consistent with ANSI K 61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at this facility for the past five years.\n\nThis facility has a written emergency response plan and provides the state and local authorities with this information as required by law.  Our emergency response plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the Douglas County LEPC.  \n\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance and safe operations.  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
