The PSM/RMP manual is reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nWilliams management understands that it has the duty of providing a safe working environment and of taking measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP manual.  \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe PCGP is a natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction facility designed to process 700 MMSCFD of raw field natural gas.  The purpose of the PCGP is to separate NGL out of the raw field gas thereby producing a residue gas and natural gas condensate liquid.\n\nTo effect the separation, the inlet field gas is chilled using a propane refrigeration system.  This process causes the NGL to condense out of the chilled gas stream.  As the gas is chilled, ethylene glycol is sprayed/injected into the field gas to absorb water.  Ethylene glycol, NGL, and residue gas are then separated in the cold separator process unit.  The remaining gaseous stream is sold as residue gas product and leaved the facility via pipeline.  The NGL stream is stored onsite in pressurized storage tanks prior to being trucked offsite for sale.  The ethylene glycol is regenerated and reused within the process. \n\nThe PSM/RMP regulated substances handled at this facility are NGL and propane.  Following is the break down of the location of these materials at the PCGP. \n\nNGL Plant Propane System: Maximum weight = 93,664 lbs\nNGL Product Storage = 1,515,214 lbs\nNatural Gas = 67,302 lbs\n\nThe propane refrigeration and the NGL extraction systems at the PCGP are the processes regulated under the 1990 CAAA Section 112?. \n\nBecause of the overfill pr"

Worst case and alternative case release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For a worst case scenario, the assumption is the complete release and ignition of the contents of all four (4) Natural Gas Liquids storage tanks located on the west end of Parachute Creek Gas Plant train II simultaneously.  This scenario involves approximately 1,500,000 pounds of NGL (figures reported as rounded to two significant digits) and has a distance to endpoint of 0.90 miles from the source of the release. \n\nThe alternative scenario is the activation of the inlet pressure safety valve.  Assuming full flow relief this would release 11,000 pounds of natural gas per minute.  At the rate of release the distance to endpoint is 0.30 miles from the inlet pressure safety valve.  Therefore, the representative alternative scenario is the activation of the inlet pressure safety valve because it results in the greatest distance to endpoint. \n\nPrevention Steps for NGL Release\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the PCGP PSM/RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the Program 3 elements.\n\nEmployee Participation ? includes provisions for active participation by plant employees, in the development and implementation of the facility PSM/RMP program as well as ready access to program information, process safety information, which has been collected in the facility office and is summarized in the PSM/RMP manual. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis ?

Assures that new processes or plant modifications meet the proper criteria before initial startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity ? To ensure the ongoing integrity of the process equipment by establishing and implementing written procedures for systems inspections and maintenance.\n\nHot Work Permits ? Require controls as specified by the Safety Manual and Procedure before hot work is performed on the regulated process.\n\nManagement of change ? Ensures that the proposed system changes are comprehensively evaluated before implementing the change.\n\nIncident Investigation ? The investigation of any catastrophic (or potentially catastrophic) incident associated with the regulated process.\n\nCompliance Audit ? Conducted at least once every three years to ensure the continued compliance of the PSM/RMP program.\n\nAccident History ? Within the five year period prior to the submittal of this RMP there were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency response Plan ? This facility has established and maintained an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP compliance manual.\n\nThe goal of the PSM/RMP program is to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical released and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes."
