      "SummaryText": "    Introduction\n\nUSEPAA?s RMP regulation (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP regulation applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under A?68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release. Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA PSM standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.  The E. Morgan Stickney Water Treatment Plant (Stickney Plant) processes do not meet the Program 1 criteria, are not subject to the OSHA PSM standard, and are not classified in any of the Program 3 NAICS codes; therefore, the facility is subject to Program 2 requirements.\n\nThe Mobile Area Water and Sewer System (MAWSS) operates the E. Morgan Stickney Water Treatment Facility (Stickney Facility) located at 4800 Moffat Road in Mobile, Alabama.  At the treatment plant, the facility stores approximately eight (8) one-ton cylinders of chlorine.  The one-ton cylinders of chlorine are used on-site as a disinfectant for treated surface water. Since the Stickney Plant utilizes more than the threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process, the facility is required to submit an RMP as defined in A?68.150.  The initial RMP was submitted as required by June 21, 1999.  To comply with the five-year update requirement, the offsite consequence analyses have been reviewed to determine whether the "

Standard protocols have been established for items such as system operations, maintenance, training, and incident investigation. \n\nThe Stickney Facility has a minimum of three (3) and a maximum of ten (10) employees on duty at any given time.  Daily inspections of the areas storing and/or using chlorine are conducted by the facility employees.  The area that stores the one-ton cylinders is fully enclosed and is equipped with a caustic scrubber for control of a chlorine release. The caustic scrubber system is equipped with chlorine detectors that will automatically activate the scrubber system if a chlorine concentration of three (3) ppm or greater is present.  In addition, MAWSS has installed emergency chlorine valve actuator, which will shut off the chlorine being supplied from the cylinders within 1.5 seconds after detecting a leak.\n\nIn the event a significant release occurs, the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency (MCEMA) would be notified immediately to respond.  The MCEMA would dispatch experienced HAZMAT personnel trained to handle such situations.\n\n    A?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\n\n\n    A?68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention \n\nAs required for Prevention Program 2 processes, one worst-case release analysis and one alternative release scenario, has been conducted.  In addition, emergency response activities have been coordinated with local responders, which is also required for Program 2 processes. Also as required, a program and document management system is in place.\n\nPro"

      "SummaryText": "gram 2 allows streamlined prevention program requirements; however implementation of the following elements are required: safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations. \n\nMalcolm Pirnie, Inc., with the assistance of Stickney Plant management and staff familiar with the processes operation and maintenance, conducted a compliance audit as part of the RMP update in January 2005.  The results of this audit, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.\n\nA hazard review of the chlorine system using the A?What-IfA? method was conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc., with the assistance of Stickney Plant management and staff familiar with the processA? operation and maintenance, in March 2005.  The results of this review identified recommended changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the chlorine system.  The results of the hazard review, including recommendations for improvement in safety, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.\n\n\n    A?68.155(d) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Smith Plant facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years that have resulted in on-site injuries or off-site injuries or other off-site impacts.\n                \n\n    A?68.155(e) Emergency Response Program\n\nIf a release were to occur, Stickney Plant employees would immediately contact the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency (MCEMA), whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine at the facilities.

The system also contains an emergency \"panic button\" located outside of the storage area to allow for operator-initiated emergency shut-off.\n\n\nShut-Off and Isolation Systems\nOther release prevention devices include equipment shutdown and isolation systems.  Flow control valves are placed at strategic locations to direct the flow of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide depending upon plant operating conditions.  These flow control valves also serve to isolate portions of the system in the event of component malfunctions or line failure.\n\nRelease Containment Systems\nRelease Containment devices incorporated into the design of the plant are primarily for spill containment.  These containment provisions for the plant are described in the facility's Best Management Practices (BMP) Plan.  The containment system discussed below is primarily for mitigation of a chlorine release.\n\nContainment Systems\nThe chlorine storage is located in an area that is fully enclosed on all sides.  The enclosure surrounding the cylinders helps to mitigate the transport of any released chlorine by reducing the effects of wind.  \n\n\n    A?68.155(f) Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in both the compliance audit and the Hazard Review.  These recommendations, and target dates of implementation, are documented in the RMP."
