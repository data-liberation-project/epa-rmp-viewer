Chemical-specific exposure prevention steps include availability of a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), air purifying respirators for the refrigeration employees, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.  Refrigeration employees are provided with HAZMAT training on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, the Company performs periodic audits and Process Hazard Analyses to enhance continued safe performance.  Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are being tracked regularly for timely completion as required.\r\n\r\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of ammonia release scenarios as worst case release and alternate release scenarios.  We incorporate several management systems to decrease the likelihood of an incident occuring.  This site has not experienced any ammonia incidents that have resulted in offsite consequences since the last RMP was submitted.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nA review into the facility's accident history revealed that there have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (June 2009 - June 2014) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nPlainville Farms has an in-house Emergency Response Team that is trained to handle an ammonia release.  All refrigeration operators are OSHA Technician Level trained (24 hours) and five (5) of the total number of refrigeration operators are Incident Commanders that are an additional 8 hours trained at the Incident Level.\r\n\r\nThe Response Plan are filed with the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee.

The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organizations and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated at least once per year.

The reason for submitting this RMP is to comply with the mandatory five year update.  This facility has one refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process. \r\n\r\nThe total ammonia inventory is 33,435 pounds.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention program is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and to minimize the negative consequences should a release occur.\r\n\r\nPlainville Farms is committed to continuously improving the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.

Drills are conducted and critiques are made to improve the response process.  The Emergency Response plan is designed to comply with all government response agencies.\r\n\r\nPlainville Farms accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n\r\n-Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration employees\r\n-Written employee participation program\r\n-Preventative maintenance program\r\n-Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration employees\r\n-Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\r\n-Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\r\n-Management of Change procedures\r\n-Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\r\n-Up-to-date process safety information\r\n-Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\r\n-Hot work permits for work on or near the ammonia process\r\n-Line break procedures\r\n\r\nThis program was developed with the participation of Plainville Farms refrigeration employees and focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration process equipment.
