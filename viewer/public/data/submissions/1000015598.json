      "SummaryText": "Milliken Chemical, a Division of Milliken & Company, owns and operates the Cypress Plant.  The Cypress Plant is a specialty chemcial batch operation located in Blacksburg, SC, which is approximately 5 miles northeast of Gaffney, SC.\n\nThe first priority of the Cypress Plant is the health and safety of its associates and the surrounding community.  OSHA recognized the Cypress Plant as a Star site in 1997 and has re-certified this classification since then in 2006, 2007, and 2010.  Of equal importance is protection of the environment.  To this end significant resources are committed to ensuring complete compliance with all regulations and that the plant is operated in a manner that protects the quality of our environment.\n\nThe U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulates Phosphorous Oxychloride when it is stored in quantities in excess of 5,000 pounds in a single location.  Cypress will become subject to these regulations because we would like to store this chemical above the 5,000 pound threshold.  Cypress currently receives and stores Phosphorous Oxychloride in drums.  Storing it in quantites above 5,000 pounds will allow us to receive in full shipments rather than smaller, partial shipments.\n\nCypress uses Phosphorous Oxychloride as a building block chemical in the manufacture of colorants to be used in plastics and urethane foams.\n\nThe Cypress plant is a program 3 facility due to the fact that the worst-case scenario modeling for Phosphorous Oxychloride predicts the potential for off site consequences.  Program 3 requires both a worst case and alternative case modeling analysis to be performed.\n\nThe U.S. EPA explicitly specifies the conditions the the worst case scenario release.  According to the General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (EPA 550-B-98-003) page 4-4, the chances of a worst case release occurring are very low.  The assumptions required for the worst case release are very conservative, including complete failure of all safety systems and worst"

These endpoints are concentrations below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without serious health effects.  The distance to the end point estimated under the worst case scenario should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger, but rather it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.  The EPA intended these distances to form the basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders and the general public rather than the basis for any specific actions.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the Cypress Plant is a release of the contents from a 55-gallon drum of Phosphorous Oxychloride at the loading dock.  The assumption is that the entire contents of a drum would be released instantaneously.  There are residences and commercial areas within this radius.  As noted earlier in the quote from the U.S. EPA, the worst case scenario represents the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for Phosphorous Oxychloride is a 55-gallon drum rupture at the loading dock.  This scenario assumes typical meteorological conditions rather than worst-case conditions as used in the worst case release scenario.  Again, there are residences and commercial areas within this radius, though it is a smaller radius than the worst case scenario.  As noted earlier in the quote from the U.S. EPA, the worst case scenario represents the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.\n\nThe Cypress Plant is committed to the education and training of all associates in the area of safety an"
