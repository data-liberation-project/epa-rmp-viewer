In particular, IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems is used as a general guide.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into Farm John's accident history revealed that there has been no facility reportable ammonia releases over the last five years (November 1999 - November 2004).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nFarmer John has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility, which is detailed in the PSM/RMP documentation.  Emergency response activities are also coordinated with the City of Vernon Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will initiate internal response procedures and call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the Department of Public Safety Emergency Management Services.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center and the Emergency Spill Report Center will be called. \n\nFarmer John maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nFarmer John will be responsible for evacuating and ensuring the safety of its employees.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) was conducted on September 1st through the 3rd, 2004, to address safety issues regarding the ammonia ref"

These studies were performed to define potential hazards associated with operational deviations of the systems.  As a result of the studies, a number of recommendations were made, such as procedural changes, ammonia awareness training and some equipment upgrades.  These recommendations are scheduled to be completed in a prompt manner.\n\nIn addition, the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year to help with their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for Farmer John employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.\tContinue to train all employees in Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's Risk Management Program, and the California Accidental Release Prevention program.  \n2.\tContinue to have employee involvement in updating and refining the above mentioned safety programs via the facility's Employee Participation program.  \n3.\tContinue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Farmer John facility located in Vernon, California, utilizes anhydrous ammonia to provide refrigeration for processing areas and cold / freezer storage rooms.  Senior management at Farmer John is committed to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management as well as the Safety Director administers the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer\u00bfs documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFarmer John has an emergency response team in place that has coordinated their emergency response efforts with the local City of Vernon Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Farmer John to evacuate the employees and to allow the HazMat team / fire department respond to the emergency.\n\nThe majority of the ammonia equipment is located inside the engine rooms.  However process rooms and cold / freezer storage rooms do have small flooded accumulator / evaporator units and piping.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Farmer John facility is located at 3049 East Vernon Avenue in Vernon, California. The facility is situated directly south of the Los Angeles River / Channel and approximately 1.1 miles southwest of Interstate 5.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban, comprised of a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia System\n\nRefrigeration at Farmer John is achieved via three anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems which are titled the North, Plant, and Soft Chill Systems.  The North and Plant Systems are interconnected via one norm"

      "SummaryText": "ally closed liquid line which is opened only in the rare event that ammonia must be transferred quickly from the North to South Engine Room.  Also, occasionally the Soft Chill and Plant Systems are interconnected via the Pump-out Compressor.  The Pump-out Compressor is set to pull suction from either the Plant or Soft Chill System (only one system at a time).  Two bolted flanges keep the suction line `switch-over' pipe securely fastened to one of the two systems.  The compressor's discharge line is normally connected to the Plant System's Intermediate Pressure Accumulator / Intercooler but can be setup to send ammonia vapor to the Soft Chill System's compressor suction line or send ammonia to the Water Diffusion Tank (again via a switch-over pipe).\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are closed systems that transform the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back to a liquid.  The systems, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, transform ammonia through various cyclical physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for processing areas and cold / freezer storage rooms.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature as portions of the liquid flash to vapor.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  \n\nFarmer John refrigeration personnel estimate the facility's total ammonia inventory at 110,000 pounds: 30,000 pounds within the Soft Chill System, 50,000 pounds within the North System, and 30,000 pounds within the Plant System.\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe Farmer John ammoni"

      "SummaryText": "a refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation, the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  Operating Engineerings, knowledgeable persons in the ammonia refrigeration industry, work at the facility to regularly maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the South Engine Room.  If ammonia is detected at a concentration of 250 ppm, audible and visual alarms are triggered inside the room.  Upon detection of 25,000 ppm, the detectors will de-energize the south engine room and activate ventilation fans which move the air/ammonia mix through a scrubber located on the roof.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibility of any ammonia releases.  The system must be manually restarted following a power outage.\n\nThe system also incorporates pressure relief valves.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to the atmosphere or water diffusion tank (depending on location) via relief lines.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately by an Operating Engineer or  refrigeration contractor.\n\nIn addition to th"
