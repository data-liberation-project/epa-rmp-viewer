Our prevention program includes the use of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training for all employees that work with anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the county Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These steps have been taken to ensure a quick response to any release and to minimize the impact of the release to the community and environment.\n\nFacility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\nWorst Case/Alternative Case Scenario:  This facility has developed a worst case and alternative case scenario however it has been withheld from this executive summary as security sensitive information as requested by USEPA.\n\nAccidental Release Program:  Effingham Equity complies with all rules and regulations relating to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including the Illinois Department of Agriculture regulations as well as OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111.  Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for all affected employees.\n\nFive year Accident History:  There has been one accidental release of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years.  The incident was caused by theft.  The incident is detailed in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  Effingham Equity has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.  Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know information is provided to thye Illinois Emergency Management Agency, LEPC, and the local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Improving safety at Effingham Equity is an on-going process.
