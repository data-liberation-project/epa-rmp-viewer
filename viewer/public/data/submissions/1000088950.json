Many of the operating personnel have been trained to the Hazmat Technician level, and do receive annual refresher training, but they will only take defensive actions in the event of an ammonia release.  The emergency plan is coordinated with local fire and emergency responders. \r\n\r\nPlanned Safety Improvement\r\nThis facility holds regular safety meetings with all Management Staff, Lead Personnel and other team members where all aspects of safety are discussed in regard to improving and maintaining a safe work environment.  Minutes of these meetings are kept in SharePoint and used to monitor progress toward safety improvement of any items discussed and agreed upon.  Systems and procedures are reviewed and updated when needed and certified on an annual basis to assure that all operations are being done in a safe and effective manner."

      "SummaryText": "Trident Seafoods Corporation has implemented the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP, which included written descriptions of all elements for these program requirements.  To strive for a coordinated and effective program, employees have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element.  There is a single person identified as having overall responsibility for these programs.  Program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and system requirements.  The entire program is reviewed at least every 3 years in a complete documentation compliance audit review.  A follow-up report of the audit is generated to improve any program elements found or felt to need improvement.  A process hazard analysis is done for the entire system every five years.  A follow-up report is also generated for the hazard analysis to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Trident Seafoods intent that the PSM/RMP for the Wrangell, Alaska Facility be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.  \r\n\r\nRelease Considerations\r\nFollowing program guidelines, a Worse Case release of ammonia was analyzed.  Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) release scenarios were considered.  Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a report.  The alternative releases were in most cases releases that were of potential concern as determined in the Process Hazard Analysis of the system and facility.  The information generated from the consideration of the worse and alternative releases is used in developing the emergency action plan for the facility, and for coordination with local emergency responders.  \r\n\r\nFive Year Release History \r\nThis system has not had any reportable releases of ammonia in the last five-year period.  If any actual release occurred, or even a near miss, an inc"
