The Adena facility has over the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated highly hazardous chemical per the U.S. .Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 40 CFR-68 RMP and OSHA 29CFR 1910-119PSM.  Adena Beef has a unified Risk Management Program (RMP) as well as OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program that are presented in this plan.\r\n\r\nThe Plant first received ammonia in November 2013 and had developed this plan.\r\n\r\n1.1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\r\nAdena Beef's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the EPA, RMP and OSHA's PSM program.\r\n1.1.1.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\r\nAdena Beef has a management system in place which is led by the Adena Beef's Plant Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of PSM/RMP elements.  This program, along with other facility-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of an ammonia release at the facility.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plant's Process Safety Information.\r\n1.1.2.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\r\nAdena Beef maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of its prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, as well as PSM elements needed to implement the program.  These are maintained in the Adena Beef plant Document Management System (DMS).  The unified PSM/RMP program was implemented in November, 2013 prior to receipt of the maximum inventory above the 10,000-pound threshold.\r\n\r\n1.2.\tTHE ADENA BEEF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE FT MCCOY, FLORIDA SITE (b)\r\nAdena Beef employs 15 ful"

Limited Partnership (Adena Meat)  The site is located at either 19789 CR 315 or NE 199 St. Rd., Ft. McCoy, FL.\r\nThe Plant includes a separate ammonia operation storage room and adjacent control room system.  The boundaries of the ammonia system subject to PSM/RMP regulation include the bulk ammonia storage and feed control rooms and the associated coolers and freezer evaporation units as well as the vent makeup and exhaust systems.  \r\nAmmonia is delivered to numerous refrigerator units and returns to the compressor room where it is cooled and liquefied for further use in the roof-mounted condenser.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\r\n1.2.2.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE (b)(2)\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule 10,000 pound EPA and OSHA threshold quantity.  Adena's ammonia process was installed as part of the process of supplying plant refrigeration.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The ammonia is stored in a receiver and distributed to the refrigerator process control systems. \r\nAnhydrous ammonia is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Ammonia's formula is NH3.  The OSHA PEL is 50 ppm.  It is flammable and is a gas at standard conditions.  Ammonia is liquefied by compression.\r\n\r\n1.3.\tWORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (c)\r\nTwo off-site consequence analyses were conducted which include two ammonia release scenarios.  The first is a worst case release.  The second is a more probable alternative"

The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur as the worst-case scenario.\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA specified endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/l.  This endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\r\n1.3.1.\tWORST CASE   (c)(1)\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions outlined in RMP-Comp.  Results demonstrate a distance of 1.0 miles to the toxic endpoint.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at zero residences.* The area within the one mile radius is best any churches, schools, residences, recreation, industrial, as well as historic areas\r\n1.3.2.\tALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of a pipe or valve in the ammonia system.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 1/16-inch diameter hole in a pipe, valve or even a vessel.

Additionally, Adena Beef demands training of contractors to its standards. \r\n1.4.2.\tAMMONIA-SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM (d)(2)\r\n1.4.2.1.\tAmmonia-Specific Policies-Procedures\r\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include: the policies and procedures listed above and those of the ammonia specific program.  These include:\r\n\u00bf\tSpecific procedures for the operation of the ammonia process are outlined below. \r\n\u00bf\tCompletion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to startup of the ammonia system was conducted in November, 2013 for the new equipment installation.\r\n\u00bf\tSpecific emergency response procedures for ammonia releases as outlined below under both operating procedures and in the emergency response procedures.  See the appendix of the Emergency Response Program book. \r\n\u00bf\tSpecific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and operations level leak repair for ammonia. \r\n\u00bf\tFinally, the details of the facility and equipment design are key to the safe operations of the ammonia system.\r\n1.4.2.2.\tFacility Design\r\nThere is an ammonia storage process area:  the compressor room.  Liquefied ammonia under high pressure is supplied via a pipe network to numerous refrigeration and freezer systems.   The high pressure ammonia evaporates to a gas in the refrigeration or freezer systems.  This ammonia gas is then drawn back into the conden"

      "SummaryText": "guidance demonstrated the rate of ammonia release is 100 lb/min*.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is 0.1 miles.  The residential population that would be impacted by this release is estimated at zero individuals.*\r\n* Population counts and key receptors are recorded in the Plant's Process Safety information.  The only public impacted in the release area are vehicular traffic on county roads and streets as well as farm works in the adjacent property.  (IE cowboys who heard cattle with in the radius.)\r\n\r\n1.4.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d)\r\nAdena Beef's accidental release prevention program is based on EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program and OSHA's PSM program.  The unified program is in place and is being effectively used.  It is part of the facility's operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall plant-wide program.  The second is the ammonia-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Marion County (City of Ft. McCoy) Fire/Rescue, and Haz Mat Team as well as the Sheriff's Department as well as the Local Emergency Preparedness Committee.\r\n1.4.1.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\r\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\r\n\u00bf\tAdena Beef has detailed process safety information on all of its refrigeration operations. \r\n\u00bf\tThe plant document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \r\n\u00bf\tTraining and on-the-job experience is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphas awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used as well as first aid and emergency response to a release. \r\n\u00bf\tMaintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of eq"
