We observe all necessary safety precautions in handling formaldehyde to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle formaldehyde, the safety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nThis facility complies with all requirements for formaldehyde storage.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is feed production.  We receive formaldehyde by transport truck and store it as a liquid in an atmospheric vessel.  Access to the process is restricted to authorized employees and contractors.  The maximum amount of formaldehyde that can be stored at this facility is 6,400 gallons (water capacity).\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of one 6,400 gallon tank when filled to its maximum allowable capacity, resulting in a release of formaldehyde.  The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 1.50 miles, based on RMP Comp, EPA's release analysis software.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are estimated to be 478 residents and a school within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe alternative release scenario consists of the release of 1,450 pounds of formaldehyde solution over a period of ten minutes due to a leaking pipe.  The operator observes the leak and isolates the leaking pipe by closing"
