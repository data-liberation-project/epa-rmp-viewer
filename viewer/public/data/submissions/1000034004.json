      "SummaryText": "1.1  Introduction\r\n\r\nPacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) operates the Gateway Generating Station (GGS), a nominal 530 megawatt (MW) natural gas-fired combined cycle electric power generating facility located in Antioch, California.  The GGS uses aqueous ammonia in its selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) to the atmosphere, as well as for condensate hydrogen ion content (pH) control, and anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant medium to chill cooling water used to reduce the inlet air temperature entering the combustion turbine.  As the company responsible for operating GGS, PG&E takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia seriously.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps PG&E takes every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n1.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nPG&E's vision is to be the leading utility in the United States; to that effect, PG&E's values are presented below:\r\n\r\n- We act with integrity and communicate honestly and openly. \r\n- We are passionate about meeting our customers' needs and delivering for our shareholders.\r\n- We are accountable for all of our own actions; these include safety, protecting the environment, and supporting our communities.\r\n- We work together as a team and are committed to excellence and innovation.\r\n- We respect each other and celebrate our diversity.\r\n\r\nThe GGS accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory programs are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\n\r\nAs a supplier of energy to app"

The GGS has also prepared an Emergency Action Plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\r\n\r\n1.3  Facility Description and Regulated Substances Information\r\n\r\nThe GGS is located on Wilbur Avenue, 1 mile northeast of the City of Antioch, in Contra Costa County, California, on the southern shore of the San Joaquin River.  Highway 4 and the Antioch Bridge are just east of the site.  Immediately south and west of the site are existing industrial facilities.  The river borders the north side, while a recreational marina, open space, and additional industrial land uses are present east of the site. \r\n \r\nThe GGS combined cycle power unit consists of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine generators, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), and one steam turbine generator.  In the combined cycle process, electricity is generated from the combustion turbines and the steam turbine.  Each combustion turbine generator converts the thermal energy of the natural gas fuel to mechanical energy, which drives the electrical generator.  At the same time, the thermal energy from the exhaust flue gas off the combustion turbines is directed to the HRSG to convert pressurized water into steam, which turns the steam turbine to drive the electricity generator.  The facility also includes two 195-foot-tall exhaust stacks on the HRSGs, one air-cooled condenser system, a wet surface air cooler, an inlet chiller system, storage tanks, a control building, electrical power transformers, and transmission facilities to interconnect the generated electricity to the power grid. \r\n\r\nBoth anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia are used at PG&E's GGS.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in a chiller system.  Aqueous ammonia is used in the GGS's SCR system to reduce NOX emissions and for condensate pH control.

Figures 1-1 and 1-2 show simplified process flow diagrams of the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia processes, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored and handled at the GGS exceeds the Risk Management Program, PSM, and CalARP Program threshold quantities.  Therefore, the GGS anhydrous ammonia process is subject to Risk Management Program, PSM, and CalARP Program regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia process is a Program 3 process. \r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia stored and handled at the GGS exceeds the Risk Management Program and CalARP Program threshold quantities, but not the PSM threshold quantities.  Therefore, the aqueous ammonia process is subject to Risk Management Program and CalARP Program regulations, but not PSM requirements.  The aqueous ammonia process is a Program 2 process.  \r\n\r\n1.4  Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\n\r\nManagement System\r\n\r\nRisk Management Program and CalARP Program regulations require those facilities with processes subject to Programs 2 or 3 to develop a management system to oversee the implementation of the program elements.  The management system has to be assigned to a qualified person or position that has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP.  PG&E has assigned the Plant Manager as the qualified person who has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP.  The Plant Manager is assisted by the Operations Supervisor, Plant Engineer, Maintenance Supervisor, and Environmental Compliance Manager in the implementation of the RMP.
