      "SummaryText": "BACKGROUND\n\nTennessee Valley Authority (TVA) bought this facility from Quantum Utility Generation in April  2015.  TVA owns and operates this gas-fired power plant, a 780 megawatt (MW) combined cycle facility, near Ackerman, Mississippi, to supply electricity to the power grid.  Construction commenced on the facility on August 15, 2002.  Commencement of operation is considered to be March 26, 2004 with Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality's (MDEQ's) receipt of the certification of construction for the diesel fire pump.  A Title V permit application was submitted to the MDEQ in March 2005.  A revised Title V permit application with revised facility and equipment details was submitted dated April 3, 2008.  An amendment application including replacement pages to the April 2008 submittal was submitted dated May 23, 2008.  A Title V Operating Permit was issued on September 4, 2009, and the permit was modified on February 22, 2013. The TVOP expired on August 31, 2014. A timely and complete renewal application was submitted to MDEQ in February 2014, six (6) months prior to expiration. The Title V Operating Permit was issued June 4, 2018 and will expire May 31, 2023.  Operations of the facility is allowed until the Permit Board takes final action on the permit application, as specified  in 11 Miss. Admin. Code Pt. 6, R.2.a(1)(c), R.4.B,and R.4.C(2).\n\n\n\nPROGRAM APPLICABILITY\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to processes storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity.  The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  One such chemical and threshold is ammonia (stored in a 20 weight percent or stronger concentration) in excess of 20,000 pounds.  To minimize the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), TVA operations include a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control system.  The SCR system uses 29.4 or less weight percent aqueous amm"

This worst-case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.   \n\n\n\nThe result of the Hazard Assessment is a \"zone of influence\" which, for toxics, is a distance at which the air concentration of the chemical is at the EPA concentration limit.  Nearly all individuals (including sensitive persons such as people with asthma) could be exposed to the EPA limit for up to one hour without irreversible or other serious health effects.  EPA states the following about the EPA toxics limit (endpoint) and the worst-case analysis.\n\n \n\n\"Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative.  The endpoints specified for the regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public.  These [toxic] endpoints are concentrations below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for one-half to one hour without any serious health effects.  In addition, the worst-case analysis is carried out using very conservative assumptions about weather and release conditions.  The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for a discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions.\"  \n\n\n\nA relea"

      "SummaryText": "se from one of the full, independent, identical storage tanks has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the Hazard Assessment.  Each storage tank is surrounded by a partitioned dike, which would fully contain a spill from a single tank, thereby reducing the evaporation rate (and thus, the impact area) of the spill.\n\n \n\nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using the equations and tables in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA Guidance), and with EPA's RMP*Comp Model. The worst case scenario does not consider the dike.  The impact distance from the RMP*Comp Model results in an impact distance of 1.0 miles. This result is greater than 0.2 mile distance to the nearest public receptor. The impact distance also extends beyond the facility property. \n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY AND RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\nThere is no accident history for the site; however, the site has coordinated its emergency response procedures with local responders.\n\n \n\nPROGRAM CLASSIFICATION\n\nCurrently, TVA does not meet one of the three criteria for a Program 1 process as the worst-case scenario impacts a public receptor.  \n\n1.  The potential worst-case scenario endpoint does not impact offsite receptors;\n\n2.  There have been no ammonia accidents with offsite impact; and\n\n3.  Emergency response has been coordinated with local providers.\n\n\n\nThe facility does not meet Program 3 requirements either.  \n\n1.  The process is in NAICS code 32211, 32411, 32511, 325181, 325188, 325192, 325199, \n\n    325211, 325311, or 32532.\n\n2.  The process is not subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR \n\n    1910.119        \n\n\n\nTherefore, the TVA operation is classified as a Program 2 facility.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION ACTIVITIES\n\nTo prevent future potential ammonia accidents with offsite impacts, TVA has undertaken prevention activities.  \n\n1.  The facility utilizes an extensive, interconnected alarm system to monito"
