      "SummaryText": "Facility Information\n\nSolar Grade Silicon L.L.C. (SGS) Moses Lake, Washington, facility is a manufacturer of silane and polycrystalline silicon for the photovoltaic industry.  SGS occupies an 80-acre plot, which is located 5 miles east of Moses Lake, Washington, on Road \"N\" NE.  The neighborhood is predominantly agricultural with several food processing plants, another chemical manufacturing facility, an industrial gas cylinder filling facility, and a corrugated cardboard production plant in the vicinity.  SGS employs approximately 165 employees.  An additional 97 personnel are employed on site by Advanced Silicon Materials, Inc. (ASiMI).\n\nProcess Overview \n\nThe SGS facility in Moses Lake, Washington, is comprised of three different production units: (1) Silane Unit, (2) Poly Reaction Unit, and (3) the Process Development Facility.\n\nThe Silane Unit, through a series of chemical reactions and separation steps, converts metallurgical silicon and hydrogen to a high purity silane gas.  Intermediates produced in the process are trichlorosilane and dichlorosilane.  Some of the silane is packaged in tube trailers and modules and temporarily stored prior to sale.  The Poly Reaction Unit uses the majority of the silane and converts it into hydrogen and polycrystalline silicon.  The hydrogen is recycled back to the Silane Unit.  The Process Development Facility, which investigates new methods for producing polycrystalline silicon, also uses silane gas.\n\nThere is one covered \"process\" as defined by the RMP rule at the Moses Lake facility.  This process includes the Silane and Poly Reaction production areas and the Process Development Facility (which are interconnected), and the silane module storage area located adjacent to the Silane production area. Together these areas are identified as the Polysilicon Manufacturing process.\n\nChemicals: \n\nSolar Grade Silicon has identified the following chemicals and maximum onsite quantities, which trigger compliance with the risk manageme"

All RMP applicable chemicals at the source are classified as flammables. \n\nIn addition to the above RMP-covered chemicals, Solar Grade Silicon has identified other potentially hazardous chemicals that could have either onsite or offsite impacts.  Risks from these non RMP-covered chemicals, as well as the RMP-covered chemicals, are minimized using similar design standards, procedures, controls, mitigation measures, and emergency response procedures.   Solar Grade Silicon is also working with the local Department of Emergency Management and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to coordinate emergency planning and emergency response for all potentially hazardous chemicals.\n\nAccident History\n\nIn the past 5 years Solar Grade Silicon has had no accidental releases meeting the criteria for reporting in the risk management plan.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSolar Grade Silicon's accidental release prevention program is based on the following essential elements: hazard reviews of equipment and processes, preventive and predictive maintenance programs, a management of change program, operator job certification and performance testing, accurate operating procedures, internal and external auditing and inspection programs, accident and near-miss investigations, etc.  Advanced process monitoring and control systems are in use at the facility, and critical parameters are monitored with duplicate instrumentation.  Loss of utilities is protected against through the use of installed and routinely tested backup systems.  Engineering and design standards ensure materials and equipment meet industry specification"

      "SummaryText": "s.  Solar Grade Silicon is known as an industry leader in silane handling safety.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSolar Grade Silicon's emergency response program has been coordinated with the local Department of Emergency Management and LEPC.  The program includes information on locations, quantities, and associated hazards of materials at the facility, as well as fixed and portable methods for containment and/or suppression of spills and releases, internal and external notification and communications procedures, alarm systems, and evacuation plans.  The facility itself is designed with numerous mitigating features, including containment and diking, deluge systems for fire and vapor suppression, strategically placed fire hydrants and fire monitors, and emergency scrubber systems.  Automatic and manual shutdown systems, as well as automatic isolation valves, are in place.  Backup firewater supplies and firewater pumps are installed.  Emergency equipment is routinely maintained and tested.  In addition, SGS maintains a highly skilled emergency response team on site 24-hours a day.  The team performs realistic monthly drills and exercises, covering a variety of response scenarios such as spill containment and cleanup, vapor suppression, firefighting, and response to injuries.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSolar Grade Silicon continues to seek and identify opportunities to improve safety through process hazard analyses, safety reviews and inspections, internal and external audits, incident and near-miss investigations, and employee and safety committee suggestions. In addition, the facility has successfully implemented a Behavioral Based Safety process, which assists employees in identifying ?At Risks Behavior.?"
