If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n\u00b7 The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\u00b7 Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\u00b7 The maximum quantity stored would be 130,000# in our three tanks, which are 18,000, and 12,000 gal. vessels.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail car with the capacity of approximately 80,000#.\n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or semi transport) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 80,000 pounds, which represents the volume the 18,000 gal. storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\u00b7The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .7 miles.\n\n4.The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\u00b7The facility has implemented the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \u00bfStorage and handling of anhydrous ammonia"

A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 DFR 1910.38;\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nc. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 DFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\nFor further information, contact: Mike Mahood, Plant Manager"
