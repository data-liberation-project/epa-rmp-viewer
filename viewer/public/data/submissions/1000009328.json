All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  \n\n\n\nThe Evonik Corporation Hopewell plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training and safety in the design installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  EC has implemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEvonik Corporation Hopewell plant is specialty chemicals production facility located at 914 E. Randolph Road in Hopewell, Virginia.  The plant is situated on approximately 40 acres on the east side of Hopewell in the industrial section of the city.  \n\n\n\nOrganic surfactants and esters have been manufactured at the EC Hopewell site since 1982, with an organo-modified silicones production facility added in 1991.  The Hopewell Polyether Plant (HPE-1) produces specialty polyethers began operation in 2004.  The plant employs approximately 150 employees at the Randolph Road site and is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\n\nEvonik Corporation produces organic surfactants, organo-modified silicones and polyethers at the Hopewell, Virginia facility.  As defined by the regulations, the Hopewell facility stores the following Highly Hazardous Chemicals (HHCA?s) in excess of the threshold quantities: \n\nA? Ethylene Oxide (CAS # 75-21-8), Maximum storage capacity = 174,488 pounds\n\nA? Propylene Oxide (CAS # 75-56-9), Maximum storage capacity = 177,399 pounds\n\nA? Allyl Alcohol (CAS # 107-18-6), Maximum storage capacity = 83,704 pounds  \n\n\n\nThe HHCA?s are util"

EPA defines the worst-case scenario as the complete release of the largest inventory of a chemical over ten minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel the farthest distance at ground level.  It assumes that none of the facilityA?s controls or safety systems is functional.  A worst-case scenario is a highly unlikely event.  \n\n\n\nThe worst-case toxic release for the Hopewell plant would be the catastrophic failure of the ethylene oxide storage tank.  Assuming all safety systems fail in the worst possible weather conditions, and a total release of the entire contents of 174,488 pounds  in 10 minutes using EPA mandated criteria, the off-site impact is predicted to be up to 8.7 miles as calculated by the EPAA?s RMP*CompA?  model.\n\n\n\nHowever this scenario is highly unlikely to occur as the tank is equipped with pressure relief devices to prevent over pressurization and subsequent rupture.  Additionally the tank is an above-ground mounded tank that protects it from fire exposure and mechanical damage.  The tank level, temperature and pressure are continuously monitored.  Additionally the tank and piping undergoes routine mechanical integrity inspections.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, this scenario is unlikely to impact up to 8.7 miles as the plant and emergency response personnel would utilize water deluge systems to minimize the release of ethylene oxide.\n\n\n\nGiven the severe guidelines of a worst case scenario, a more realistic alternate or planning "

This scenario involves smaller releases and allows safety systems to be included in the release containment and dispersion calculations.  These alternate release scenarios are useful to local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\n\n\nAlternate release scenarios are those which are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  Alternate release scenarios are those that lead to concentrations above the EPA specified endpoint and which extend past the facilityA?s fence line. EGC has utilized EPAA?s default modeling parameters and assumed releases at ground level.  All alternate release modeling utilized EPAA?s RMP*CompA? model, which yielded a toxic endpoint of less than 0.1 miles for all scenarios modeled.  Local area gas detection and intervention by plant personnel are considered as active mitigation measures.\n\n\n\n-Ethylene Oxide: The alternate release scenario involves a release due to a gasket leak on a 2A? unloading line.  The calculated release rate is 10 pounds per minute requiring twenty minutes to abate.\n\n-Propylene Oxide: The alternate release scenario involves a release due to a gasket leak on a 2A? unloading line.
