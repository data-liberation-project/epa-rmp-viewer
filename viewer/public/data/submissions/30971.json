Introduction:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Niota terminal is an ammonia terminal that unloads ammonia barges from the Mississippi River into a storage tank.  The ammonia is then loaded into trucks for transportation to agricultural distribution centers.  The facility has been in operation since 1967.\n \nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen Company, Niota Terminal, has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors since operations began in 1967.\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention and Record: \n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Niota facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths to plant personnel or contractors since it was constructed in 1967.   In addition, the plant has operated without a lost time accident for over thirty-two years.  There have been no RMP reportable releases of toxic chemicals in the last 5 years.\n \nC. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen facility in Niota has incorporated a safety vision that states, \u00bfWe, the employees of Royster-Clark Nitrogen, utilize teamwork, communication, and education, with the full support of management, to achieve safety excellence.\u00bf   Royster-Clark Nitrogen employees utilize this vision statement as a reminder of the priority of achieving safety excellence.  Employees are highly involved in creating and implementing safety programs and safety systems at the facility, with a focus on continuous improvement.\n\nHighlights of the Safety Program include:\n\nExtensive employee participation in the development, implementation, and review of safety systems and programs at the facility.

Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, networked computers that provide all employees instant access to up to date safety information, participation in Process Hazard Analyses, and continual employee training. \n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.   Within this system, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems. \n\nTraining of plant personnel includes: (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices. \n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the processes.  This system requires that process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and verify that existing controls have not been compromised.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all affected personnel receive training on the change. \n\nD.
