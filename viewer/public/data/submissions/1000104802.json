The maximum quantity released based on 85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06), as well as possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC {Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site. We believe the most likely release would be caused by damage to the liquid valve on a nurse tank due to a transportation incident. This could lead to the total loss of contents of the tank. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is determined per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. {ANSI) standard K61.1-1999 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration {OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, Breakaway couplers at risers, Emergency shut-off valves, Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.

In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 424510, Grain and Field Bean Merchant Wholesalers, however we are also engaged in providing agricultural inputs that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. The NAICS code we feel most applicable for this activity is NAICS code 424910 Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers. Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Planning at this time.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early and fall months. During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs. The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank.\n\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.
