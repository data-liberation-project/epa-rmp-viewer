The current training program is comprised of the following:\r\n\u00bf\tInitial employee training;\r\n\u00bf\tPeriodic refresher training;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\r\n\u00bf\tCompetency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\r\n\u00bf\tTraining records for each employee.\r\n\r\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspections were conducted on January 2, 2013 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted on October 2, 2013.\r\n\r\nRMP Change Management:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health.  The Facility RMP Change Management (RMPCM) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Review:  The pre-startup review applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated.  Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-startup safety review.  This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the RMPCM review.  Additionally, a pre-startup safety review is performed in conjunction with the RMPCM review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years.  Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n1.\tFACILITY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE POLICY\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of the TSI, A Division of The Tremont Group, Inc. (TSI), Dixon Facility (Facility) at 7235 Tremont Road, Dixon, California 95620 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Consolidated Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\r\n\r\n2.\tFACILITY INFORMATION\r\n\u00bf\tThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in Northern California.\r\n\u00bf\tAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) and aqua ammonia are received, converted, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients. \r\n\u00bf\tAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in either an 18,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) or a 30,050-gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 209,930 pounds.\r\n\u00bf\tAqua ammonia is produced from anhydrous ammonia and stored in a 10,000-gallon storage tank, an 18,000-gallon storage tank, or an 8,300 gallon storage tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 265,535 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.\tTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 131,288 pounds of anhydrous ammonia; this represents the volume of the largest storage tank administratively limited at 85% of capacity.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible p"

The worst-case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 131,670 pounds of aqua ammonia that forms a liquid pool.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a pipe break modeled with an increased wind speed and D Stability modeling parameters.\r\n \r\n4.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\t\r\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\r\n\r\nSafety Information:  TSI ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees.  The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on November 6, 2013.\r\n\r\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the ammonia processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  The most recent update of the hazard review for the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes was conducted on November 6, 2013.  Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\r\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The operating procedures were last revised on October 2, 2013.\r\n\r\nTraining:  The TSI Facility staff, as well as The Tremont Group, Inc. (Tremont) corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.  The training program was last reviewed on Octob"
