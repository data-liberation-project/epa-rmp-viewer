It is the intent of the Selma Terminal to incorporate the most recent construction and procedural guidance (NFPA #58-2008) into this process.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Selma Fire Department as well as the Johnston County LEPC.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services (Selma Ambulance) and Johnston Medical Center.  This facility trains its employees to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.\r\n\r\nBlanchard Terminal Company LLC - Selma Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and two 60,000 gallon butane storage tanks.\r\n\r\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the system's two 60,000 gallon butane storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate (potential off-site impact) release scenario is a BLEVE accident and associated fireball.\r\n\r\nBlanchard Terminal Company LLC - Selma Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.  The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC), instructions and recommendations.\r\n\r\nAs this is a new sy"

      "SummaryText": "stem, this facility has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Blanchard Terminal Company LLC - Selma Terminal's butane blending system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Selma Fire Department and request their assistance.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Johnston County Emergency Management.  The Selma Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\r\n\r\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.  Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this stationary source as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection.  \r\n\r\nBlanchard Terminal Company LLC looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Selma Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills.  Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."
