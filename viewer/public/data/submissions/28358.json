      "SummaryText": "1. Facility Policy\nThe owners, mangement, and employees of Pro Ag Solutions, LLC are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of anyhydrous ammonia to the environment.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility is prepaired to work with the local fire department, local law enforcement, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and all other pertinent authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and environment.\n2. Facility Information\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, sale and distribution of anyhydrous ammonia, which is used by farmers as fertlizer for crop production nutrients.  The maximun quantity stored at the facility is variable depending on demand.  A bulk storage tank at the facility stores 18,000 gallons (84,117 lbs.), but often times some of the \"nurse\" tanks (the tanks used for distibution of the product) are also filled.  These tanks average 1,000 gallons (roughly 4,700 lbs.) in size, and perhaps 50% (or roughly 34 tanks) may be filled at any one time, resulting in the potential of an additional 159,800 lbs. being on-site.\n3. The Worst Case Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n    a.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total content of a bulk storage tank, largest of which is 18,000 gallons (84,117 lbs.)  This release would occur over a period of 10 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million) is 2.23 miles.  The assumed atmospheric conditions are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, and a highly stable atmosphere. (Catagory F) \n      b.  Two alternative release scenarios have been developed and are based on most likely potential incidents.  These are a rupture in a transfer hose or piping, or a release from one of the 1,000 gallon nurse tank (resulting in a total discharge of the tank).  The distance to the endoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million is 0.4 miles for a p"

      "SummaryText": "ipe rupture, and 0.9 miles for the nurse tank rupture).  Thses are based on a rupture or puncture of a hose or piping of 0.5 square inches, and a rupture of 1.0 square inches for the nurse tank.  The assumed atmospheric conditions are a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, and a neutral to slightly stable atmosphere (Catagory D)\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility has developed a program which incorprates the precisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc.  and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n5.  The five-year Accident History \nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: \" have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility\"; nor \"To our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\nThe facility has written emergency action plan that follows OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38, coordinates with state and local authorities, and provides emergency planning and community right- to -know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  This plan outlines all activities and persons to be contacted in the case of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the facility.\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety Improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
