It is the responsibility of the Plant Manager to ensure that all procedures are followed.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, it is Sun Pacific's policy to immediately call the local CDF department and assist this agency.\n\nSun Pacific is a grower, packer, shipper located at 13129 Avenue 248, Tulare Ca, 93274 that uses chlorine gas stored on site in three one ton tanks sanitizing the wash water in our tomato dump tanks.\n\nRelease senerios:\nFor this document two separate scenarios were used:\"The Worse Case\" as required by law and the \"Alternative Release\" (most likely).  The worse case scenario was based on a sheared valve releasing 1000 pounds of liquid chlorine gas in 10 minutes.  Distance to the toxic end point is 3 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario was identified through the what-if study performed on April 4, 2006 at an RMP/PSM training at Sun Pacific-Tulare conducted by Charles Howell of SEACO Technologies Inc.  This scenario involves a leaking fitting or line that would possibly release 10 lbs. per minute for 15 minutes with a toxic end point of .2 miles."
