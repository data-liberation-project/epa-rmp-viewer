This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n    To save lives.\n    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n    To protect the environment.\n        To minimize property damage.\n\nAmericold maintains an emergency response (safety) committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold Milwaukei Plant 80545 facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating c"

The release was caused by an overpressure in a refrigeration compressor at the facility. During the incident 2 on-site and 1 off-site persons were injured, none of the injuries were serious. The incident caused the evacuation of persons both on-site and off-site.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Americold milwaukie Plant #80545 has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\nDuring the RMP Review, it was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills to ensur"

In addition, it was recommended that the facility contact the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDuring the review & update of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the Process Hazard Analysis study generated mitigation measures that would improve safety at the AmeriCold  facility (80545) located at 9501 S.E. McLoughlin Boulevard in Milwaukie, OR.  These action items were entered in a management plan and were addressed.\n\n\nIn addition to the equipment related mitigation measures recommended to improve safety at this facility, The Development Team made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety.  These recommendations are a result of the review of the PSM prevention programs and the Emergency Response Program for preparation of the Risk Management Program and Plan. These recommendations were entered in a management plan and were addressed."
