JEA is committed to operating this and other JEA facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of JEA and Contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  JEA is committed to operating this and other JEA facilities in full compliance with all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the Facility is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable OSHA and EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, JEA has developed an integrated Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan (the Plan) for the Facility.  Among the important components of the Plan are JEA's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the Facility, and JEA's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Facility. \n\n\n1.2  STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Facility is designed for the treatment of waste water from Jacksonville's sanitary sewer system.  The Facility uses chlorine for waste water disinfection (the primary chlorine system), and sulfur dioxide to control the level of residual chlorine in the treated effluent (the sulfur dioxide system).  The Facility has the capability to add chlorine to the return wells (secondary chlorine system) to control the growth of filamentous bacteria.  \n\nChlorine for the primary chlorine system is delivered to the Facility and stored in a 90-ton rail car that is located in a secured area on the Facility property.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine at this location is 180,000 pounds.  Sulfur dioxide is delivered to the Facility in a tractor trailer tank truck and transferred to a 5,000 gallon steel aboveground tank for storage.   When full, this tank holds 58,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  \n\nCh"

The secondary chlorine system is located adjacent to the secondary clarifiers.  The total maximum intended inventory of chlorine at this location is approximately 8,000 pounds in four one-ton containers.\n\n\n1.3 WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the 10-minute release of the full 180,000 pounds of chlorine from the rail car, as required by applicable Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  Consideration was given to a release of the full 58,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide over a ten minute period, however, the endpoint for that scenario was found to be a shorter distance from the Facility than that for the chlorine release.  Thus, the chlorine release was used as the worst case release scenario.  There are presently no passive mitigation measures in place at the Facility that would limit the quantity of the release as defined by the regulatory requirements.  Using the methodology prescribed in the regulations, this worst case release results in potential impacts to off-site receptors.\n\nA more realistic, alternative release scenario also was examined for chlorine. For this scenario, it was assumed that the container valve mounted on a full ton container is damaged, resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in 12 minutes.  This scenario also results in potential impacts to off-site receptors.\n\nA more realistic, alternative release scenario also was examined for sulfur dioxide.  For this scenario, it was assumed that a semi-tractor trailer truck leaves the road and runs over the sulfur dioxide storage tank filling station, breaking off the valve and plug at the end of the fill line resulting in a release of 130 pounds of liquid sulfur dioxide over a period of 11 seconds.  The release is limited by a check valve located at the storage tank. This scenario also results in potential impac"

This program is documented in the integrated Plan and is based on the requirements of applicable PSM/RMP regulations.  The effectiveness of this program is evident by the fact that the Facility has had no significant releases of chlorine in the five years prior to the date of this Plan.\n\n\n1.5  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the Facility in the five years prior to the date of the Plan that resulted in injuries or death to Facility or Contractor employees onsite or the offsite public, or damage to potential environmental receptors.\n\n\n1.6  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by Facility employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  This ERP has been communicated to the City of Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department (JFRD) and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  It is JEA's policy with regard to emergency response that its personnel are trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  These are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a hazardous substance release and who have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities of the release.  They would take no further action beyond notifying the authorities of the release.  Thus, it is JEA's policy for employees to call 911 in the event of a release emergency and allow the local Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Response Team to mitigate the release conditions.  The JFRD is presently responsible for determining when evacuation of offsite areas is necessary, and for public notification.\n\n\n1.7  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Plan incorporates a number of modifications to Facili"
