The Seminole Gas Processing Plant identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of the Baker Engineering & Risk Consultants, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow methodology for RMP radius of exposure for a 1-psi overpressure. According to the analyses, the maximum end point for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 724 feet (0.14 miles) from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained  in the Propylene Accumulator storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (80% at 60 degrees F). The maximum distance beyond the plant property boundary is 250 feet, which enters into the Oxy Seminole District pipe yard. Since the plant is located in a sparsely populated area, this worst-case release would not affect any public or environmental receptor beyond property owned and occupied by Occidental Permian.\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the Executive Summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.
