Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Rupari Food Services, Inc. (Rupari) facility located at 15600 Wentworth Avenue in South Holland, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being submitted as the five year RMP update.  This RMP includes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases.

Rupari Policies to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Rupari; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Rupari is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Rupari's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and we have taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur.

Rupari has developed an Emergency Action and Response Plan (EARP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\n\n\nIII.    Facility Identification\n\nThe Rupari facility is located at 15600 Wentworth Avenue in South Holland, Illinois.  Rupari is an importer, processor and distributor of quality pork products. Specializing in ribs, both domestic and imported, the company sells to both retail and foodservice customers around the country. \n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311612.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for processing and distribution.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating coolers, freezers, and production areas at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia in System 1 is approximately 23,000 pounds.  System 1 is used for cooling in the storage freezer, coolers, process areas, and compressor oil cooling.  System 1 consists of four (4) high stage compressors, two (2) booster compressors, two (2) evaporative condensers, three (3) storage freezer unit evaporators, eight (8) cutting room evaporators, four (4) holding cooler evaporators, one (1) injection room evaporator, two (2) shipping dock evaporators, one (1) palletizing room evaporator, two (2) receiving dock evaporators, two (2) RTE chill cell evaporators, one (1) RTE package room evaporator, one (1) RTE cooler evaporator, one (1) RTE cooler evaporator before the smokehouse, two (2) tumbling room evaporators, one (1) auto purger, one (1) low temperature accumulator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) high temperature accumulator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) high pressure receiver, and one (1) intercooler.\n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia in System 2 has been calculat"

In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - Rupari maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed on April 24, 2015.\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - Rupari has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Rupari conducted a PHA study for Systems 1 and 2 which was completed on April 3, 2015.\n\n?

Contractor Qualifications - Rupari has updated a site-specific contractor qualification procedure that ensures all contract employers' safety performance and programs are evaluated, a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained, information of potential hazards are communicated between Rupari and the contract employer, and required training and information is communicated, such as the provisions of the emergency response plan and control over entrance into process areas.\n\n?    Incident Investigation - Rupari has updated a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure will also make provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n\n?

Rupari committed to continuous improvement and periodically reviews and updates the Process Safety Management Program as best practices and new technology evolve.  \n\n\n\nXI.    Management Program\n\nRupari has updated a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This system has assigned qualified person(s) (or position) to assist in the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals will be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.  Currently, Simon Madrigal, EHS Manager, is responsible for implementation of the overall Risk Management Program.  \n\n"
