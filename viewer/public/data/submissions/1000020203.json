              "Description": "This process consists of two storage tanks and is interconnected with five reaction vessels in a manaufacturing building with interconnected piping.  The storage tanks are located within a concrete diked area complete with a firewater sprinkler system and a flammable vapor detection system.  The tanks are pressure vessels with a design working pressure of 75 PSIG.  The storage tanks utilize relief valves with rupture discs, freon refrigeration and a nitrogengas (inert) blanketing system as control devices.     The storage tank area contains a firewater system supply controlled by a flammable vapor detection system.  The presence of flammable vapor causes the fire water sprinkler system to activate causing a water deluge to occur in the ethylene oxide storage tank area.   The reactor vessels have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, a nitrogen gas purge system, emergency air supply, computer distributed control system, plus an instrument interlock system which will no allow ethylene oxide to be fed into a reactor vessel unless a number of process parameters are satisfied.  The plant personnel are trained annually in emergency response procedures including fire brigade training, hazard communication training and HAZWOPER training.  All production tickets are reviewed by the engineering department after a production run has been completed.",

The planet personnel are annually trained in emergency response procedures including fire brigade training, and HAZWOPER training.  All production tickets are reviewed by the engineering department after a production run has been completed.",

              "Description": "This process consists of the formaldehyde storage tank, seven reactor vessels in one manufacturing building, five reactor vessels in another manufacturing building, and the interconnecting piping.  The formaldehyde is stored in an insulated heated above ground storage tank.  The storage tank is blanketed with nitrogen gas and the nitrogen gas/formaldehyde vapors are vented to the plant vapor combustor system as a control device.  The tank is equipped with high liquid level shutoff protection and relief valve protection.  A firewater system with hydrant monitors is available for use in fire conditions.  Both fire fighting foam and spill control (vapor suppression) foam is maintained at the plant.  The reactor vessels in both manufacturing buildings have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, nitrogen purge systems, a vapor combustor for vapor destruction, emergency air supply and a computer distributed control system for batch reaction control.  The plant personnel are annually trained in emergency response procedures including fire brigade training, hazard communication training, and HAZWOPER training.",

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS).  Baker Petrlolite does not expect a WCS to ever occur.  An ARS is a more realistic scenario that is more likely to occur than the WCS at a facility such as Baker Petrlolite.  The ARS's will help the LEPC to improve the community emergency response plan.  \n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Baker Petrlolite Bayport manufacturing facility.  Because the processes at the Baker Petrlolite Bayport plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nBaker Petrlolite encourages plant employees to participate in all areas of process safety management and accident prevention.  Employee participation ranges from updating technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. The employees have access to all information contained in the Baker Petrlolite plant accident prevention program.  One of the ways to address process safety and employee safety issues is in the monthly plant safety committee meetings.  The committee consists of plant operators and management personnel.\n\nBaker Petrlolite keeps a variety of technical documents that used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

A program is in place for all process equipment to comply with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nBaker Petrlolite has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with various processes.  Each process is systematically examined to identify process hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  Baker Petrlolite uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis method to perform these systematic reviews.  The HAZOP team consists of people who have operating, maintenance, and engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as accident prevention and makes suggestions for additional measures as needed.  The team findings are then documented and all approved changes are implemented for corrective action.  These periodic reviews are conducted on a 5 year cycle and will continue until the covered process is no longer operating.  Again, the team findings are documented and retained.\n\nBaker Petrlolite maintains written procedures for the manufacture of specialty chemicals.  Each specialty chemical requires a specific \"batch ticket\" for the manufacture of that chemical intermediate or finished product.
