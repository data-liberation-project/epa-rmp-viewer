Davidson Wastewater Treatment Plant\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe City of Huntsville N.  B.  Davidson Wastewater Treatment Plant is committed to the safety of our workers, the public, and the environment. The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment. The City of Huntsville N.  B.  Davidson Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\r\n\r\n2.0 Description of The City of Huntsville N.  B.  Davidson Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe City of Huntsville N.  B.  Davidson Wastewater Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.
