The primary purpose of the facility is to repackage and distribute industrial gases to wholesale customers. The flammable characteristics of Methane, Ethylene, N-Butane, and Isobutane make it necessary to observe certain precautions when handling. Overall, the prevention of exposures and reducing the threat to associates personal health, as well as reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations. It is Airgas Specialty Gases policy to adhere to all applicable local, state, and federal rules and regulations. Overall safety of the facility depends upon the manner in which products are stored and handled, combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided to all personnel responsible for the use of the systems. \n\n\n\nWritten policies and procedures for handling these products are followed each day. Maintenance when necessary is performed by qualified Airgas personnel or contracted out to pre-qualified companies who have trained personnel in the proper maintenance of the systems. The mechanical integrity of the systems is maintained in accordance with all good engineering practices. Airgas maintenance personnel and contractors have access to the Operations & Maintenance manuals for all systems.\n\n\n\nThis facility has a Process Safety Management plan which is incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program requirements. The facility follows the Airgas Safety Management System that includes items such as Lockout/Tag out, Hazard Communication, Contractor Safety, etc. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan in place to aid in the prevention of accidental releases and natural disasters that may affect the facility. \n\n\n\nThe Williams County LEPC and the Stryker Fire Department have been provide"

      "SummaryText": "d copies of this plan. If a release were to occur at this location, associates would be notified of the release by activation of the audible alarm and muster at the evacuation point for a head count and notify the Stryker Fire Department if necessary.  The Stryker Fire Department is the primary response agency to a release at this location and is trained in Hazardous Materials operations. \n\n\n\nThis facility has a flammable worst case scenario. The flammable worst case scenario for a flammable release would be tank failure of the 11,000 gallon refrigerated storage tank storing Ethylene. This release if the vessel were full would have a release of 49,500 pounds of Ethylene. \n\n\n\nActive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. Passive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. \n\n\n\nThe distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 0.3 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered rural. This release scenario could impact approximately 8 persons in a 0.3 mile radius. This information was determined using RMP*Comp and MARPLOT software. \n\n\n\nAn alternate flammable release of Ethylene from a tube trailer would be the most probable release for this location. If this were to happen with Ethylene, an estimated release rate would be approximately 125 pounds per minute for a total of a 2000 pound release.  Pressure relief devices are designed to fail in the event of an overpressure and if there was a release it most likely would occur due to a failed relief device. \n\n\n\nThe distance to endpoint for the alternate release scenario is 0.1 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered to be rural. This release scenario could impact approximately 6 person in a 0.1 mile radius. This information was determined using RMP*Comp and MARPLOT software. \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from this facility in the past five year.\n\n"
