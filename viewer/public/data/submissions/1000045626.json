      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nJuly 18, 2014\n\n\n\nUSALCO Baltimore Plant, LLC (USALCO) manufacturers chemicals used in water and wastewater treatment and general industry.  Our products include Aluminum sulfate, Sodium aluminate, Aluminum chloride hydroxide sulfate, Aluminum chloride and Polymer.\n\n\n\nThe chemicals on-site that exceed the reporting threshold for RMP are Formaldehyde and Dimethylamine.  Formaldehyde is in an aqueous solution and stored in an 8,000-gallon tank at the facility.  The Dimethylamine is also in an aqueous solution and stored in an 8,000-gallon tank on site, although administrative controls limit the storage to 7,000 gallons.  Both chemicals are used in our polymer plant.\n\n\n\nDimethylamine is the worst case flammable.  Formaldehyde is the worst case toxic.\n\n\n\nA minimum team of two people and an unloading procedure and checklist are used for Dimethylamine and Formaldehyde unloading to ensure safe deliveries.  All storage and unloading areas have secondary containment; the polymer plant perimeter is curbed to create a containment area in the polymer plant.\n\n\n\nUSALCO is committed to handling chemicals responsibly, which includes continual environmental, health and safety training for plant employees as well as training our customers in the safe use of our products.  At USALCO we believe that all jobs can be accomplished without injury to employees or harm to the environment.  USALCO has trained personnel that will respond to any chemical release at our facility or customer's facilities.  Training is conducted to insure personnel can respond to emergencies that could occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical operators go through drug and alcohol testing at initial hire and for cause and participate in a random testing program.  Employees are encouraged to participate in the Safety Committee, Communications Committee and PSM/RMP Committee meetings.\n\n\n\nUSALCO uses standard operating procedures for handling chemicals in various processes.  The procedures plus the knowledge and experie"

      "SummaryText": "nce of the employees coupled with the design, maintenance and integrity of the various processes allow for a continuation of our history of no serious accidents.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nUSALCO has not had a reportable release since 1997.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nUSALCO trains all production and maintenance personnel to give them the ability to contain and mitigate emergencies at the plant.  USALCO is a member of the South Baltimore Industrial Mutual Aid Program (SBIMAP).  SBIMAP is a group of private companies and public agencies that have entered a mutual agreement to interact and practice emergency scenarios that may arise in the Baltimore Area.   SBIMAP meets regularly with the Maryland Department of the Environment Emergency Response Group and Baltimore City Hazmat.\n\n\n\nUSALCO personnel maintain proficiency through monthly meetings and emergency response training at various times throughout the year.  This is the basis for further plant specific training in the areas that utilize Dimethylamine and Formaldehyde. \n\n\n\nUSALCO schedules training on Dimethylamine, Formaldehyde and emergency response drills periodically.  USALCO Baltimore Plant uses a computerized maintenance management system to facilitate the inspections and records keeping that are part of the PSM process.\n\n"
