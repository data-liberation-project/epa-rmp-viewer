      "SummaryText": "  Enchanted Parks, Inc. has handled chlorine gas, without any reportable releases, for the last 14 years.  It currently uses chlorine approximatly 140 days per year.  During this time chlorine is consumed through a vacuum system requiring a suction to distribute the gas to the swimming pools.  All equipment is routinely serviced by in-house staff as well as outside vendors.  At the end of seasonal  operation all equipment used in the sanitation process is serviced for the following year.\n  The chlorine system is monitored with 2 different gas detectors.  An audible alarm sounds and park personnel and the local fire department are contacted.  Four park employees are trained at the hazardous material technician level.  Ongoing staff trainings occur during the time gas chlorine is on-site.  Our local fire department is located within 1.5 miles from the facility.  Currently several outside agencies inspect the facilities and operations.  Annual emergency drills are also practiced with the staff.  The Chlorine Handling Manual is updated periodically.\n  Enchanted Parks, Inc. strives to ensure the safety of all guests, employees and the surrounding community in every aspect of the operation."
