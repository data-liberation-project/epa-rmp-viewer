(BMC) Terminal facility located in Beaumont, TX was previously operated as a manufacturer of methanol and anhydrous ammonia.  During the month of December 2004 the manufacturing plants were shut down indefinitely and the facility converted to a Terminal operation for storage and transfer of methanol and anhydrous ammonia that is shipped to the site from other locations.  BMC is a subsidiary of Terra Industries Inc. (Terra) of Sioux City, Iowa.  \n\nIt is Terra\u00bfs policy to prevent accidental releases from the BMC Terminal by effective Process Safety and Risk Management programs and procedures.  This includes the following:\n\n*  Participation by all Terminal employees in every element of Process Safety and Risk Management.\n\n*  Conduct regular scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\n*  Utilize current and accurate process safety information.\n\n* Maintain current and accurate written operating procedures.\n\n* Provide timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment.\n\n* Oversee the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their job safely.\n\n* Follow established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety.\n\n* Administer a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards.\n\n* Investigating incidents when they do occur to promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience.\n\n* Audit the entire Process Safety and Risk Management program on a regular basis to verify that elements, procedures, and systems are in place and adequate.\n\n* Maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan, as well as participating in a well-trained and equipped onsite emergency response team.\n\n* A system to notify facility neighbors in the ev"
