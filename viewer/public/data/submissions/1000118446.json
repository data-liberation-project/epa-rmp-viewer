      "SummaryText": "Keystone Generating Station (Keystone) is a coal-fired, electric power generating station located in Shelocta, Pennsylvania. Aqueous ammonia (29.4 percent) is currently used by this facility in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system. This is accomplished by injecting the ammonia solution into the flue gas before it is passed over a catalyst. The facility is subject to RMP requirements for the use of the aqueous ammonia; the facility is considered a Program 1 facility. Program 1 is applicable to any process that has not had an accidental release with off-site consequences in the five years prior to the submission date of the RMP and has no public receptors within the distance to a specified toxic or flammable endpoint associated with a worst-case scenario (WCS) release. The aqueous ammonia system at Keystone has not had an\naccidental release in the past five years. There are no public receptors within the toxic endpoint distance associated with a WCS release from the aqueous ammonia system. Therefore, the aqueous ammonia process is subject to the requirements of RMP Program 1.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage is comprised of four 66,000-gallon storage tanks, pumps, piping, instrumentation, and controls. Administrative controls are used to ensure that the tanks are not filled above the 90 percent level. All four 66,000-gallon tanks are connected to a common header at the forwarding pipe skid. The storage tanks are in a concrete diked area for secondary\ncontainment. Tanker-truck unloading is also provided with secondary containment. The storage tanks are equipped with a number of safety devices including relief valves, pressure gauges, liquid level gauge, excess flow valve, and emergency shutoff valves. The remaining components of the system are also equipped with appropriate safety devices.\n\nThe maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of aqueous ammonia (0.14 mg/L) was determined for the WCS release by using dispersion modeling. The off-site consequence was evaluat"

      "SummaryText": "ed by quantifying the affected population and identifying the presence of public and environmental receptors affected by the releases. To determine the maximum distance outward within\nwhich the endpoints could be exceeded in the event of an accidental release (also known as the hazard impact distance), the USEPA's RMP*Comp software dispersion model was used. RMP*Comp is used to perform off-site consequence analysis required under USEPA's RMP Rule. The maximum distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release scenario was\ndetermined to be 0.2 miles. The results of the hazard area analysis were generated from MARPLOT. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis showed that there are no public receptors within the hazard area, and therefore, the aqueous ammonia system qualifies for Program 1."
