Accident prevention is a responsibility recognized and shared by all employees and all levels of management. \n\n\n\n- Prevent environmental incidents\n\nSpills and accidental releases to the environment are unacceptable. Through careful planning and regular review of our facilities and operations, we seek to identify risks and proactively eliminate them.\n\n\n\n- Ensure sustainable compliance, and go beyond compliance when necessary to protect human health and the environment\n\nVSC's operations encompass a wide range of activities that are subject to many national, state and local regulations and standards. The company has also established its own policies that support and, in some cases, are more stringent than the regulations. To achieve sustainable compliance, we continuously monitor our operations and the changing legal requirements and address any situations that may compromise our ability to comply.

We also strive to reuse or reclaim materials to the greatest extent economically feasible, to minimize the amount of waste requiring disposal. While this prevention approach is preferable, some amount of after-the-fact treatment of wastes is required in our manufacturing processes. We are committed to operating waste management and pollution control equipment to minimize environmental impacts.\n\n\n\nVSC Gurnee Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\n\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\n\n\nVSC uses two (2) RMP regulated chemicals: ethylene oxide and propylene oxide as raw materials.  These chemicals are used to manufacture surfactants.  The end products of the Gurnee site using the RMP chemicals as raw materials are used for personal care, food additives and automotive coatings.  \n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility complies with EPA's Risk Management Program, OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Process Safety Code. The facility's PSM program serves as the RMP Prevention Program.  The Prevention Program describes the policies and procedures in place to prevent and address accidental releases; these include Employee Participation, Process Hazard Analyses, Operating Procedures and Safe Work Practices, including Hot Work; Training, Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Contractors, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nThe site uses a mix of control equipment, procedures and processes, and work practice controls to reduce the risk"

A separate program logic controller (PLC) continuously monitors process safety parameters on equipment and activates controls to bring operations into a safe mode if parameters are exceeded; and,\n\n\n\nb.  Emissions control devices, including the site's main scrubber which capture emissions of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide from the manufacturing process and transform the emissions into innocuous chemicals which are routed to off-site treatment and disposal;\n\n\n\nc.  A wastewater pre-treatment system which transforms the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide before discharge to the North Shore Sanitary District's wastewater treatment plant; and, \n\n\n\nd.  A fugitive emissions and a leak detection program to detect leaks and fugitive emissions before they become a problem.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year accident History\n\n\n\nIn February 2010 the facility experienced a propylene oxide excursion when catalyst was left out of the reactor preventing the product from reacting. Several attempts were made to troubleshoot the reaction with PO being vented to the scrubber and new PO added. This action overcharged the scrubber capacilty with an estimated 9,500 pounds of PO. An estimated 2,740 pounds PO was discharged from the scrubber to the atmosphere.  Lab testing for catalyst before the oxide addition was added to the process operating instruction to prevent this from reoccurring.\n\n\n\n5.
