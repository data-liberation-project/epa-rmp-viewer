In the event an\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), \nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on\nthe specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people\nand the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during\nthe early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs .  \nThe maximum quantity on site and the capacity of the largest vessel have been shared with the local emergency response personnel. \n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and\nreloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  \nOur facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected  at various times of day and night throughout\nthe year.   Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest\nAnhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released is  based on 85 % tank capacity of the largest vessel as limited by design standards.   The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06).  Possible public and environmental receptors within the area has been provided to the County LEPC (Lo"

We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and \"pull away\" valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) was computed per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".   We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous\nAmmonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, Emergency shut-off valves,  Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.   We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.  We have developed an emergency Action Plan for employees, customers, and visitor protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and other acts of God that initiates evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our company including the Anhydrous Ammonia facility included in this plan.

We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29CFR 1910.38.

Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure they conform to the community plan(s).  We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia and\nPropane training programs by the local fire department(s), local emergency response team, community planners, etc. that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at all of our facilities.
