The BCL3 is then transfilled into 1A cylinders (70 pounds) and stored on-site until delivered to customers. Waste BCL3 from line purging is treated in a caustic eductor and scrubber system. The entire system is equipped with sensors, alarms, automatic shutoff valves, exhaust enclosures, and specialty piping. The process control system has rupture disks, excess flow switches, and manual control valves. The storage area is monitored 24-hours with sensors connected to the Life Safety System.",

The source material gas which is transfilled and sometimes purified may be packaged in ton cylinder units (i.e. tonners) or regular cylinders, depending on the gas.  The finished product varies from a single pure chemical gas to gas mixtures.  The finished product cylinders vary from 2000 pounds to less than 1 pound of gas depending on the  of the cylinder and the type of material involved.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas is committed to developing and maintaining the manpower, the equipment and the procedures necessary to prevent accidental releases of chemicals.  In addition we are committed to developing and maintaining the manpower, the equipment and the emergency response procedures necessary to mitigate a release quickly and effectively if it does occur.  \n\nRegulated Chemicals and Processes\n\nThere are 7 chemicals in 8 processes at the Matheson Tri-Gas Newark facility that are regulated under the Federal RMP Program. The detailed applicability of all inventory levels is listed in the on-site California RMP (Cal-ARP) documentation. The 7 chemicals regulated by Federal RMP regulations can be summarized as follows:\n  \nChemical ------ Process\n\nAmmonia ------ Bldg 7 NH3 Tonner Storage\nArsine ----- Bldg 7 AsH3 Cylinder Storage\nBoron Trichloride ------ Bldg 7 BCL3 1A Cylinder Storage\nChlorine ------ Bldg 7 CL2 1V Cylinder Storage\nChlorine ------ Bldg 7 CL2 Tonner Cylinder Storage\nHydrogen Chloride ------ Bldg 7 HCl 1A Cylinder Storage\nHydrogen Fluoride ------ Bldg 7 HF 1A Cylinder Storage\nTrichlorosilane ------ Bldg 7 HSiCl3 Pod Cylinder Storage\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Mitigation Measures\n\nThe major elements of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and release mitigation measures at this site are as follows:  \n\nLife safety system.

      "SummaryText": " A state-of-the-art life safety system was installed in late 1999 and early 2000.  This system monitors the presence of various toxic and flammable gases in areas where those gases are stored or processed.  Two-stage alarms are set for each sensor.  The low-level alarm alerts the facility that a problem may be developing.  The high-level alarm provides notification to the Fire Department as well as to the facility.  The system provides real time readouts of gas concentrations and records information that assists in both preventing and mitigating gas releases as well as information that can assist in improving the process.  \n\nAdherence to objective equipment standards.  One of the most significant contributors to the prevention of accidental releases at this site is the high standards to which all gas cylinders must be manufactured.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) has detailed requirements for manufacturing and testing cylinders. Cylinders must be manufactured according to a particular metallurgical standard and be able to withstand overfilling; an increase in pressure; an increase in temperature and the possibility that they will be hit or fall over.     \n\nPiping and other equipment such as tanks associated with gas processes adheres to TGO standards.  Toxic gas processing is done in exhausted enclosures that meet ventilation standards.  All residual gas is vented to scrubbers that are constructed to meet both air emission and fire code standards.  \n\nProcess hazard analysis.  Process hazard analyses are performed on relevant processes to determine potential hazards and recommendations for process improvements. \n\nDevelopment and implementation of standard operating procedures.  \n\nA comprehensive training program that includes classroom and on-the-job training. \n\nA systematic preventive maintenance program.

There are a series of internal and external electronic gates that restrict access into the facility. There are personel on-site 24/7/365 to inspect and safeguard all equipment and storage. Motion detectors and facility cameras are available for recording activity through the plant.\n\nFive-Year Accident History.

This would include the years from December 2005 to December 2010.\n\nEmergency Response Program.\nA brief description of the elements of this facility's Emergency Response Program are as follows:  \n\nIdentification and location of hazardous materials.  All hazardous material have been identified, located and mapped.  A cylinder storage procedure maintains consistent locations for each material.  \n\nA trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) of 20 members.  ERT members must go through refresher training every year.  At least four responders are always available during after-work hours.  Appropriate personal protective equipment is maintained at the site for response actions.  \n\nEvacuation procedure.
