In the event\nthat an accidental release should accur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s),\nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the\nspecific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people\nand the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nWe are engaged in \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous\nAmmonia.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing and reloading is\n#493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product \nsubject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle Propane\nfor both agricultural uses and home heating, which is under consideration as a listed substance.  We\ninclude Propane (as well as all crop protectants and petroleum products) in our planning, training and\nmaintenance programs, however only facilities used for Anhydrous Ammonia are included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammmonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the\nearly spring and late fall months.  During the balance of the year, inventories will be storage only, with\nlittle if any product transfer taking place.  The maximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage\nvessels at the location is 130,000 lbs.  The maximum on site vessel size is 18,000 gallons storing\n78,000 lbs.  The maximum quantity"

Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time empoyee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our\nfacilities have adequate lighting and are inspected at barious times day or night during use and\nthroughout the \"off season\" when not in use.\n\nItem number 3.5 addressing quantity released shows a total quantity released of 79 pounds however\ndue to the pressure in the line, the release rate is 200 pounds per minute which, given the release\nduration of 10 minlutes would indicate a release of 2000 pounds.  When the pressure of anhydrous\nammonia is reduced quickly, the material rapidly self-refrigerates to -33 degrees F.  Once the liquid\nreaches this temperature vaporization is quite slow, from where we estimate a 10 minute release\nduration.  Additionally, the excess flow valve which will stop the flow from the tank when flow rates\nexceed the rating, has an orifice which will allow 0.05 pounds per minute of ammonia to escape at\n100 psi.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous\nAmmonia tank, rfeleased as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 lbs.\nBased on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of\ndispersion to 200 PPM) based on EPA's OCA guidance tables, public and environment receptors, and\nresidential population within this area have been provided to our Local Emergency Planning Committee to\nassist them in emergency planning.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nWe have not had an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia at this site.
