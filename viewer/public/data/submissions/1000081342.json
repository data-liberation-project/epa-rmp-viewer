This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safety and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant, located near Cheyenne Wells, Co. operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The Ladder Creek Helium Plant handles methane, ethane, propane, and butane which are regulated flammables.  It processes approximately 35 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  The Ladder Creek Helium Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\r\n\r\n General Accidental Release Prevention Program \\ Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Ladder Creek Helium Plant. Because processes at the Ladder Creek Helium Plant are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regu"

      "SummaryText": "ing\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Ladder Creek Helium Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive initial training in Ladder Creek Helium Plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Consequently contractors working on or near process equipment at the Ladder Creek Helium Plant are trained on procedures to ensure that contractors \r\n(1) perform their work in a safe manner, \r\n(2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, \r\n(3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \r\n(4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, \r\n(5) understand and follow site safety rules, and \r\n(6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with \r\n(1) a process overview, \r\n(2) information about safety and health hazards, \r\n(3) emergency response plan requirements, and \r\n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Ladder Creek Helium Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

      "SummaryText": "adder Creek Helium Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\n\r\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally read.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\r\n\r\n Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: \r\n(1) conducting training, \r\n(2) developing written procedures, \r\n(3) performing inspections and tests, \r\n(4) correcting identified deficiencies, and \r\n(5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on \r\n(1) an overview of the process, \r\n(2) safety and health hazards, \r\n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, \r\n(4) emergency response plans, and \r\n(5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. \r\n\r\nWritten procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Ladder Creek Helium Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include \r\n(1)  control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, \r\n(2)  a lock tag try procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, \r\n(3)  a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, \r\n(4)  a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), \r\n(5)  a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes.
