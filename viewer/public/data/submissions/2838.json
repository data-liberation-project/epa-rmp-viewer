The Facility Policy\n    The owners, management, and employees of Pawnee Marketing LLC, Pawnee City Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or the other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility Information\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for final sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is only available during convertsion of 10-34-0 at this location and thenn only stored in D.O.T. approved tank truck.\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 40,000 pounds at anyone time. A full tanker would unload into an empty tanker parked on a concrete load pad. When conversion is complete the tanker is removed immediately.\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n     a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 40,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 8.5 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.25 miles.\n     b. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .09 miles.\n4   The accidental release prevention program.\n     The converter operates under the OSHA Process Safety Management Rules.\n     Mike Schilling - local manager has attended a anhydrous ammonia safety school through the Nebraska Department of Health and currently working toward becoming an EMT with local Fire Department.\n5.  The 5-year accident history\n     There have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n     Other than monitoring the equipment necessary for converting there are no other plans for safety changes."
