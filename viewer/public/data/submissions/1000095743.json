Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nINEOS Oxide, a Division of INEOS Americas LLC (INEOS) L.L.C. - Plaquemine, Louisiana Operations (INEOS) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. As an integral part of this commitment, INEOS has developed and implemented a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, emergency response and employee training associated with the processes at its Plaquemine, Louisiana facility. This program complies with all of the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" and Chapter 59 of LAC 33:III, \"Chemical Accident Prevention and Minimization of Consequences\".\n\n\n\nIt is INEOS' policy to always operate the manufacturing processes in a safe manner and according to established procedures and good engineering and management practices. As part of this policy, INEOS has established the appropriate management and administrative controls for the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that such a release may occur, trained emergency response personnel are available on site to take the necessary and appropriate corrective action to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\nINEOS has also established lines of communication with the Iberville Parish Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), in the event that an accidental chemical release may have beyond-the-fence line effects and for additional emergency response expertise that may be deemed necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

Specifically, INEOS owns and operates the Ethanolamine Unit and operates the Glycol Ether and Polyethylene Glycol Units for DOW. The three production units that now comprise the INEOS facility, manufacture approximately 18 different ethylene oxide and propylene oxide derivatives used in a wide variety of consumer products such as antifreeze, shampoo ingredients, automotive fluids, cosmetics, and water purification chemicals.\n\n\n\nINEOS uses a few organic chemicals as raw materials, including ethylene and propylene oxides, methanol, n-Butanol and ethylene glycol. Inorganic chemicals used in the process include phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide and ammonia, among others. \n\n\n\nNone of the products and byproducts manufactured at the INEOS facility are regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) established by Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The only RMP-regulated substances present at INEOS, above the RMP threshold quantities, are Anhydrous and Aqueous Ammonia. Ethylene Oxide [Oxirane] and Propylene Oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] are both used as raw materials in the INEOS processes, but are received by pipeline from nearby DOW facilities on a continuous basis and as needed in the chemical manufacturing processes. Consequently, there are no storage facilities for these two chemicals within the INEOS Block 55 perimeter.\n\n\n\nMaximum inventories and threshold quantities for RMP-regulated substances at the INEOS facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana are shown below.\n\n\n\nRMP Regulated Substance Inventory Quantities (lbs):\n\nAmmonia (Anhydrous) (24-hr.

Quantities of these chemicals on-site do not exceed the RMP threshold quantities. The amounts shown are the volumes of the existing in-line surge drums.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received on-site via pipeline from a 3rd party contractor.  It is stored under pressure in a spherical tank (DS-205) until being pumped into the process. DS-205 has a gross storage capacity of approximately 750,000 lbs. of ammonia, but the necessary administrative controls (written operating procedures and level controls and alarms) are in place to limit the maximum amount of ammonia in the tank to 500,000 lbs. DS-205 has no refrigeration, therefore the material is kept under pressure usually between 75-85 degrees F. The vapor pressure of anhydrous ammonia in this temperature range is between 140 and 180 psia.\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia is generated on-site when the anhydrous ammonia is mixed with condensate in an ammonia absorber (D-210) in the front end of the plant. The aqueous ammonia is stored in D-210 until being fed to the reactor through a high-pressure pump and piping.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nINEOS has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out by the USEPA under 40 CFR Part 68.

Health and safety procedures are being reviewed and revised as needed by INEOS. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe INEOS facility maintains detailed records of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes, including those that involve the regulated chemicals.

These studies included the process units that now comprise the INEOS facility. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses include What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, the DOW Fire and Explosion Index, the DOW Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis (PHA). It is DOW's practice that these studies be undertaken periodically by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and that any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. INEOS management is committed to continue these practices. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the manufacturing processes, INEOS maintains complete and up to date written standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each process. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. The SOPs also discuss potential deviations "

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks and responsibilities are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of the change and provided the necessary training so that they understand the modification(s), the reason(s) for the change, and how their job responsibilities will be affected as a result.\n\n\n\nINEOS' MOC procedures were implemented under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements: therefore, they are compliant with RMP requirements as well. These procedures require, among other things, that process safety considerations be evaluated anytime a process change is considered to evaluate any potential on-site and off-site impacts and whether the change will require a process hazard analysis (PHA) to be conducted.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nProcedures are in place at INEOS to perform Pre-start up safety Reviews related to new processes and to modifications in existing processes.
