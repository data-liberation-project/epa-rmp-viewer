To maintain frozen conditions in the warehouse, VDF operates a mechanical refrigeration system in which the refrigerant is anhydrous ammonia.  No manufacturing is done at the site.  Products are brought to the site by truck for storage;  various assortments of these products are then assembled for reshipment to area outlets.\n\n\n\nThis refrigeration plant was newly constructed in 1987 and recently purchased by VDF.  VDF maintains an active safety management program to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The facility complies with OSHA's PSM regulation and maintains the associated documentation.  Periodic training and drills are conducted to ensure familiarity with all emergency procedures.\n\n\n\nA rigorous program of operator training, preventive maintenance, and periodic inspections is maintained to prevent the accidental release of ammonia, and all required safety programs are in force at the facility.  \n\nSince VDF purchased the facility, there have been no reportable accidental releases of ammonia and no accidents involving the release of ammonia.  VDF has coordinated emergency response activities with the local (Manteno) Fire Department which is less than one (1) mile away.\n\n\n\nThe facility is located to the East of the Village of Manteno, in a county  location which remains rural in nature.  The refrigeration system is adequate for the amount of cooling needed, and is capable of holding 26,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  All ammonia is stored in the system; there is no additional storage on-site.\n\n\n\nVDF personnel are trained to respond to minor releases and minor repair/maintenance problems.  However, for a major release, the facility would call upon the Manteno Fire Department for emergency response.  Facility personnel are trained in response actions which consist of minimizing da"
