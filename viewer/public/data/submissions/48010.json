Bigler Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining its facility in a safe, environmental manner.  Contractors and employees will be involved in all design, installation, operation and mantenance of our equipment.  The plant will focus on process safety, which is to be implemented in safety policies, practices and procedures designed to safely handle any hazardous substance.  The facility is a member of a site-wide Emergency Response Team that includes fire, rescue, medical and environmental response.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\nThe Bigler Terminal is located at 1500 North South Street in Pasadena Texas, 77501.  The terminal will receive an LPG stream by pipeline that will be stored in T-4609 sphere.  The LPG product will be loaded into railcars and trucks to be delivered to customers.  The LPG stream is a mixture of C-4 olefins and saturates which is also governed by strict HRVOC environmental regulations. The terminal has developed procedures to safely handle the C-4 olefins and saturates to minimize exposure to the environment.\n\nToxics - None\n\nOur processes use the following chemicals in excess of the threshold quantities specified in EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) reglation.\n\nFlammables\nWe can store up to 378,000 gallons of flammable mixtures on site.\n\nFlammable mixture includes Butane, 2-Butene-trans, 2-Butene-cis, 1-Butene, 2-Methylpropene, Isobutane, and 1-Pentene.\n\nOur comprehensive operations and maintenance procedures, accidental release prevention activities and contingency planning efforts will allow us to effectively manage the hazards that these materials pose to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nThe results from these scenarios will be used to help ensure that our emergency response plan and t"

Employees will routinely participate in process unit and plant wide safety improvement reviews, focusing not only on process safety but also personal safety issues. These personnel will assist in developing all operating procedures and will participate in process hazard analysis.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \nThe Bigler Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with our various chemical processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process will be systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  We primarily use the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  These studies will be conducted using teams of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  These team"

At least every five years, the plant will update and revalidate these hazard analysis results.  Recommendations from these studies will be sent to management for evaluation and implementation.  Final resolution of the recommendations will be tracked, documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe plant will maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdown.  These procedures have been developed and will periodically be revised by experienced operators, as needed.  Such procedures will not only aid in consistent day-to-day operation but will also provide a basis for consistent training of new operations personnel.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Bigler Terminal has well-established practices and procedures in place to properly maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, monitoring and control systems, pumps and all other critical equipment.  The basic aspects of the program will include:  proper training, written procedures and plans, periodic inspections and testing, correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities are a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nAll of the individual elements of our prevention program will work together to help prevent process upsets and accidental chemical releases.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the general system elements discussed above, the Bigler Terminal will have additional safety features on specific areas of concern.\n\nRelease Detection\nHydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n- Process relief valves that discharge to a flare\n-"

Our program will provide the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we will coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.  We will have mobile fire protection equipment, alarm systems, trained emergency responders and communications links to off-site responders to help prevent or minimize a release.\n\nPlanned Activities to Further Improve Safety\nThe Bigler Terminal, which is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management rules, will have a comprehensive Safety Management Plan that is focused on continued improvement.  Within that management plan will be the values to maintain and safely operate facility equipment all the time."
