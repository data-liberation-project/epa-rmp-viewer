Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company (Dow) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public \nsafety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, \nsuch as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and \nmaintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent \nforeseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained \npersonnel will respond to isolate and deny entry and control the release to the extent possible.   \nDow personnel will also notify the Torrance Fire Department who will assume command of the \nincident, if necessary, until the release is stopped.\n\n\nSection 2.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Dow facility, located in Torrance, CA, primary activities are the manufacturing of \npolystyrene plastic and polystyrene foam products.  Ethyl chloride is the only regulated \nsubstance present at our facility, and is used to manufacture polystyrene foam products.\n\n\nSection 3.  Worst Case Scenario \n                  Alternative Release Scenario with Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures  \n\nThe ethyl chloride storage tank and tank car unloading process is subject to the requirements of \nthe EPA\u0012s RMP regulation.  This regulation requires Dow to analyze the process to determine \nthe worst case release scenario and an alternative, or more likely, release scenario.  The worst \ncase release scenario submitted for this process involves a catastrophic release of 274,000 lb. \nof ethyl chloride from the storage tank.  The storage tank\u0012s dike was considered as a passive \nmitigation system when evaluating this scenario.  Passive mitigation systems are those devices, \nequipment, or technologies that function without human, mechanical, or other energy source."

Active mitigation systems are the converse of passive \nmitigation systems, in that they require human, mechanical, or other energy sources to function. \nThe release is also controlled by monitoring and detection systems including 1) flammable gas \ndetectors, 2) a television camera, 3) sensors measuring pressure, temperature, and level \ndeviations.\n\nThe EPA RMP*Comp(TM) methodology, developed by the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA), was used to model both the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\n\nSection 4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  All facilities at the Dow Torrance, CA \nsite were designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Fire \nCode, and all other applicable codes and standards in place at the time of construction.

We also \nhave an air operating permit ID under Title V of the Clean Air Act.  The following sections briefly \ndescribe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary \nsource.\n\na)  Employee Participation\n\nDow truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  \nCompany employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident \nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Specific examples of employee \nparticipation range from writing and updating operating procedures to participating as a member \nof: 1) accident investigation teams, 2) project pre-startup reviews, and 3) process hazard \nanalysis (PHA) teams.  All employees are encouraged to report any unsafe conditions and to \ninitiate the Management of Change process to correct the condition.  Dow employees are also \nencouraged to intervene in unsafe acts to prevent injury to other employees.  Employees have \naccess to all information created as part of the Torrance site Injury and Illness Prevention \nProgram.  In addition, the Torrance site has a Site Safety Steering Committee whose function is \nto address overall site process safety and employee safety issues.  The Site Safety Steering \nCommittee has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, \nengineering and plant management.\n\nb)  Process Safety Information\n\nDow keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the \nprocesses located at the Torrance, Ca site.  These documents address chemical properties and \nassociated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and \nequipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including \nexposure hazards and emergency re"

This information is supplemented by documents that \nspecifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the \ninadvertent mixing of chemicals.  Safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., \ntemperature, level, and composition) are maintained in documentation located in the plant \ncontrol room.  Dow ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process \ncontrols and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument \nsystems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  These reference documents are readily \navailable to all employees.  Several of these documents are also supplied to the Torrance Fire \ndepartment, such as MSDSs and site maps, which show location of hazardous materials \nstorage.  Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining \nup-to-date process safety information.\n\nDow also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design \nand construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, \ndesign pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, \nin combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing \ninspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility \nchanges to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\nc)  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nDow has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various \nprocesses are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically \nexamined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these \nhazards.\n\nDow primarily uses the Fire and Explosion Index (F&EI) and Chemical Exposure Index (CEI) \nanalysis techniques as scr"

If the F&EI \nand/or CEI analyses determine that a significant hazard exists from a process unit, then a \nHazard and Operability (HAZOP) study is completed for the unit.  In all cases, the analyses are \nconducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as \nengineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, and makes \nrecommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as needed.  A relative \nrisk ranking is assigned to the recommendations to aid in prioritization of the corrective actions.\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are then forwarded to local management for review.  Local \nmanagement prioritizes the recommendations, compiles a corrective action list with responsible \nparties and target completion dates and forwards this to corporate management for final review.  \nLocal management is accountable for the completion and documentation of these items.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly \nfrom the original design safety features, the Dow facility periodically updates and revalidates the \nhazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will \nbe conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and \nfindings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are \nforwarded to local management to be prioritized and addressed accordingly. \n\nd)  Operating Procedures\n\nDow maintains operating procedures written to provide clear instructions for safely conducting \nactivities associated with the process.  The operating procedures include the following items.\n\n  * Startup\n  * Normal Operations\n  * Shut down\n  * Emergency Shutdown\n  * Startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown\n \n These proced"

The operating procedures are maintained current and \naccurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of \nchange process.\n \n In addition, Dow maintains information describing normal operations in a set of documents \ncalled Best Run Data.  Operating limits, consequences of deviation from these limits, and \nrecommended actions that should be taken to avoid or correct the deviation are found in the \nprocess control computer logic programming documentation.  This information, along with \nwritten operating procedures, is readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as \nnecessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n e)  Training\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, Dow has implemented a \ncomprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New \nemployees receive basic training in personal safety, plant operations overview, and emergency \nresponse via the Minimum Requirements Checklist.  After successfully completing this training, \na new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.\n \n After operating technicians demonstrate (e.g., through oral tests and skills demonstration) the \nknowledge adequate to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can \nwork independently.  The entire initial training process takes approximately two years to \ncomplete.  In this two-year period, operating technicians only perform those tasks that they \nhave demonstrated competency in.  Additionally, all operating technicians periodically receive \nrefresher training on plant systems to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at \nan acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this \ntraining is documented for each operator, including the means us"

Because contractors \ncan work with, on, or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that \ncontractors: 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and \nskills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the \nevent of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform Dow personnel \nof any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors \nwith: 1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency \nresponse plan requirements, and 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  A Dow \nplant representative verifies that these items have been accomplished through the safe work \npermit process.  In addition, Dow evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during \nthe selection of a contractor.  Dow personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to \nensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n \n\n g)  Pre-startup Audits\n \n Dow conducts a Pre-startup audit for any new facility or facility modification that requires a \nchange in the process safety information.  The purpose of the Pre-startup audit is to ensure \nthat: safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for \nstartup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This audit provides one additional check to \nmake sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting \nsystems are operationally ready.  The Pre-startup audit team uses checklists to verify all \naspects of readiness.  A Pre-startup audit involves field verification of the construction and \nserves a quality ass"
