              "Description": "Nation Pizza Products uses a direct ammonia refrigeration system for cooling Process Rooms, Holding Freezers, Coolers, Docks and Blast Freezers.  The refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a two stage evaporation/condensation cycle.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia related equipment could be divided into four sections.  \n\n1.    The ?ultra low pressure? equipment contains (2) Blast Freezer Evaporators, (2) Surge Drums, Ultra Low Temp Accumulator (ULTA-1), Transfer Vessel, Oil Pot and (2) Booster Compressors. \n\n2.    The ?low pressure? equipment contains (4) Freezer Evaporators, Low Temp Accumulator (LTA-1), Transfer Vessel, Oil Pot and (2) Single Stage Compressors.    \n\n3.    The ?intermediate pressure? equipment contains (4) Cooler Evaporators, (5) Corridor Evaporators, (15) Process Room Evaporators, (4) Dock Evaporators, (1) Glycol Chiller, High Temp Accumulator (HTA-1), Intercooler (INT-1), Transfer Vessel, (2) Oil Pots and (3) High Stage Compressors.\n\n4.    The ?high-pressure? equipment includes the (2) Evaporative Condensers, Pilot Receiver, Constant Pressure liquid receiver and associated piping/valves.\n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration provides cooling by utilizing the heat input required to change a liquid to a vapor (latent heat of evaporation) and then heat output discharged when a gas collapses to form liquid (latent heat of condensation). ?Heat? is quantified by definition and is ?labeled? as calories or Btu (British Thermal Unit).  One Btu, by definition, equals the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water, 1 ?F when the water is 70 ?F, and at sea level pressure.  All other compounds reference this definition.  For example, the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of liquid ammonia at 70 ?F and 128.8 psia  = 1.129 Btu/lb (this is also referred to as the ?Specific Heat?). The amount of heat required to vaporize 1 pound of ammonia (at a corresponding pressure to 70 ?F, 128.8 psia) = 508.6 Btu.  Therefore, a system is 500 times more efficient in heat transfer per pound of ammonia utilized if the system incorporates change of state: liquid boiling off forming a vapor.\n\n\n\nThis ?heat? must be removed from the system or the system would reach a point that no more ?heat? could be absorbed (e.g. the liquid evaporates, and now must be condensed).  This is accomplished by compressing the gas to a pressure such that Air/Water passing over the Condenser coils would accept heat from the gas.  The (vaporized) gas, in rejecting heat, condenses, and thus provides liquid to begin the cycle again.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia flow direction is based on pressure differences (either by gravity or forced) and by the difference in volume between a gas and a liquid containing the same amount of ammonia.  The active driver of this system is the compressor.\n\n\n\nThe evaporation/condensation cycle is as follows:\n\nUltra Low Suction\n\n?    Ammonia gas at low pressure from the Ultra Low Temp Accumulator (ULTA-1) enters the booster compressor suction line and is compressed to higher pressure corresponding intermediate pressure.  The ammonia is co-mingled with lubricating oil in the compressor.\n\n\n\n?    The intermediate-pressure gas is directed to the oil separator to remove the majority of oil (employed to lubricate and cool the compressor).\n\n\n\n?    The intermediate-pressure vapor passes to the intercooler where it is cooled to the saturated suction temperature of the intermediate suction.\n\n\n\nIntermediate Suction\n\n?    Ammonia gas at intermediate pressure from the Intercooler (INT1) and the High Temp Accumulator (HTU-1) enters the high stage compressor suction line and is compressed to higher pressure corresponding to the Saturated Condensing Temperature.  The ammonia is co-mingled with lubricating oil in the compressor.\n\n\n\n?    The intermediate-pressure gas is directed to the oil separator to remove the majority of oil (employed to lubricate and cool the compressor).\n\n\n\nLow Pressure Suction\n\n?    Ammonia gas at low pressure from the Low Temp Accumulator (LTA-1) enters the singe stage compressor suction line and is compressed to higher pressure corresponding to the Saturated Condensing Temperature.  The ammonia is co-mingled with lubricating oil in the compressor.\n\n\n\n?    The intermediate-pressure gas is directed to the oil separator to remove the majority of oil (employed to lubricate and cool the compressor).\n\n\n\nHigh Pressure\n\n?    The high-pressure vapor passes to the evaporative condensers where the latent heat is removed from the gaseous ammonia and the ammonia is condensed into liquid. The fans and water pumps automatically start (sequentially) to maintain the ammonia high-pressure set point.\n\n\n\n?    The condensed liquid ammonia is collected in the pilot receiver and then flows into the central constant-pressure receiver.\n\n\n\n?    The constant-pressure (CPL) ?sub-cooled? liquid ammonia is directed to all evaporators through a Hand Expansion valve where (CPL) liquid pressure is reduced allowing the  ammonia to remove heat from air passing over the evaporator, vaporizing (boiling) in the process. The Vapor/Liquid is returned to either the Ultra Low Temp Accumulator, Low Temp Accumulator or the High Temp Accumulator depending on which system the evaporator is on. All access liquid is transferred back to the constant pressure receiver utilizing the transfer system on each accumulator.\n\n\n\nSecondary Ammonia Cycles\n\n?    High Pressure Liquid (HPL) ammonia is directed from the pilot receiver to the compressors and is injected into the compressor for oil cooling.\n\n\n\n",
