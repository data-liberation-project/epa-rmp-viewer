Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\r\n\r\nThe management and employees of Bureau Service Company  are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Tiskilwa Fire Department, Bureau County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 1892 1825E. St., Henry, IL  61537, is the storage and distribution of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of (1) 30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized  facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 281,227 pounds; this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in nurse tanks.\r\n\r\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA'S Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of title 8 Illinois Administrative Code Part 215: Anhydrous Ammonia, Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities, based upon the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA'S) \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" (6th Edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI / CGA G-2.1 2014\" , and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling\" of Anhydrous Ammonia\".

The Emergency Response Program.\r\n\r\nThe facility has:\r\n* A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\r\n* Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\r\n\r\nIn the event of emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Tiskilwa Fire Department and Bureau County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\r\n\r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.
