DGC achieved its goal of becoming a certified Responsible Care Company by passing a certification audit in December 2008 and has retained certification since.\n\nAchieving this goal demonstrates that DGC's effective management system works to continually improve in the areas of health, safety, security, environmental performance and product stewardship as stated in the policy. The third party Responsible Care Management System recertification process was performed in 2020 with DGC being an approved Responsible Care site based on this audit.\n\nThe elements of the Process Safety Management Systems within the RMP are detailed in Section 7. As a follow-up to our Responsible Care certification, there has been a refocus and effort to upgrade and support the initiatives for process safety. \n\nDGC is committed to chemical risk management which includes eliminating or reducing hazards, preventing incidents, minimizing or containing incidents, preparing the public for possible incidents, and responding promptly to emergencies.\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Program, DGC meets with area residents to discuss programs in place to protect the public. These meetings present an opportunity to share information about new activities taking place at the Synfuels Plant. DGC also views this as an opportunity to answer questions the public may have about the plant and its operations.\n\nIn addition to public meetings, DGC offers tours to local residents to help learn more about the plant. Another convenient way for the public to obtain information regarding issues of concern is through contact information on the www.dakotagas.com website. \n\nDGC accomplishes off-site safety by safely designing/building/modifying oper"

A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated Emergency Response Plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards. Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur. The LEPC maintains a coordinated Emergency Response Plan for the community, detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials. The plan is available for public inspection. DGC must file detailed information with local, state, and federal agencies concerning hazardous materials located on-site and emissions of hazardous materials.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our on-site emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. DGC health and safety procedures ensure that emergency response facility personnel are well trained through the use of an extensive in-house and off-site training program.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBefore EPA adopted the new RMP regulation, DGC took proactive steps upon initial ownership to ensure worker safety and protection of the public and environment by implementing policies concerning health, safety, and environment. The existing DGC Emergency Response Plan was modified to conform with the requirements of Section 112(r) of the CAAA. Changes to the existing Emergency Response Plan primarily involved performing a new Hazard Assessment and putting the existing Emergency Response Program and OSHA Process Safety Management Program into Section 112(r) format.

Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Synfuels Plant provides a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including response to and mitigation for fires, explosion, hazardous and gas releases; adequate first aid and medical treatment; evacuations; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public; as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nPotential off-site impacts are addressed through an in-place Emergency Response Plan to deal with the DGC health, safety, and environmental policies. In case of an off-site release impact, DGC is responsible for notifying residents and businesses downwind out to 4 1/2 miles from the plant. The notification will be done by using the computerized out-calling system. Mercer County Emergency Services will notify residents beyond 4 1/2 miles. Notification will be made to the Mercer County Sheriff's Office, North Dakota State Emergency Commission, National Response Center, and the on-call DGC Environmental Department representatives. In case of an accidental release with a potential off-site release impact, the public will be instructed to either shelter-in-place or evacuate.\n\nDGC has a long-standing commitment to protect the safety of our employees and the public through risk management. We continuously review and improve our accident prevention and emergency response program and procedures. Employees are highly skilled and trained to safely design, construct, operate, and maintain the plant and perform their jobs. Fully trained response teams are thoroughly prepared to respond to facility accidents and other incidents. DGC employees work hard to follow all applicable safety regulations and have established strict safety programs and procedures to make the plant as safe as possible.
