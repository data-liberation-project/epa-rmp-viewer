A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the process safety overview information for each process to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits Document.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Company - Texas City Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled."

However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Company - Texas City Plant is located at 2800 FM 519 East, Texas City Texas 77590.  The plant is owned by BP Amoco Chemical Company.   The plant produces 2.9 billion pounds a year of petrochemical products including paraxylene and metaxylene.  The plant contains four operating units and an OSBL area.  Four of these areas are covered under the RMP rule (PX1, PX2, PX3, OSBL).  All four of the covered units qualify for Program 3 coverage. The covered processes contain regulated flammable mixtures held above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and the OSBL area contains a 29% solution of aqueous ammonia over the threshold quantity.   The flammable mixtures contain various regulated substances such as but not limited to propane and ethylene.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to calculate worst case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated substance on-site.  The purpose in calculating these types of scenarios is to encourage community dialogue on chemical accident prevention and risk reduction.  The BP Amoco Chemical Company - Texas City Plant has performed these calculations using the methodology given i"

      "SummaryText": "Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Company - Texas City Plant uses several analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  These techniques include HAZOP, What if / checklist type reviews.  All analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n \r\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed by management for resolution.  A written action plan is generated by management assigning responsibility and determining an expected completion date for each recommendation made during the PHA.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked in an electronic database to completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and tracked.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Company - Texas City Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal sh"
