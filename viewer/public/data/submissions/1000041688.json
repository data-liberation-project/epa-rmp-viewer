This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Company - Texas City Plant is located at 2800 FM 519 East, Texas City Texas 77590.  The plant is owned by BP Amoco Chemical Company.   The plant produces 2.9 billion pounds a year of petrochemical products including paraxylene and metaxylene.  The plant contains four operating units and an OSBL area.  Four of these areas are covered under the RMP rule (PX1, PX2, PX3, OSBL).  All four of the covered units qualify for Program 3 coverage. The covered processes contain regulated flammable mixtures held above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and the OSBL area contains a 29% solution of aqueous ammonia over the threshold quantity.   The flammable mixtures contain various regulated substances such as but not limited to propane and ethylene.\n\n\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to calculate worst case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated substance on-site.  The purpose in calculating these types of scenarios is to encourage community dialogue on chemical accident prevention and risk reduction.  The BP Amoco Chemical Company - Texas City Plant has performed these calculations using the methodology given i"

      "SummaryText": "n the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.  The results of these calculations have been provided to the EPA and to the Galveston County LEPC, and have been shared with members of the local community.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nFollowing is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the BP Amoco Chemical Company - Texas City Plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Company - Texas City Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.

These techniques include HAZOP, What if / checklist type reviews.  All analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n \n\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed by management for resolution.  A written action plan is generated by management assigning responsibility and determining an expected completion date for each recommendation made during the PHA.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked in an electronic database to completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and tracked.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Company - Texas City Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal sh"
