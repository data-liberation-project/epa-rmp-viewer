ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES: We at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and protection. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at this facility. It is our goal and objective to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If an accidental release were to occur, Brenntag has coordinated emergency response\n\nactivities with Hillsborough County Fire/Rescue which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release. We are also able to employ resources from our Brenntag facility in Orlando, FL if necessary.\n\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE & THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: Brenntag's primary activities at this facility encompass chemical warehousing and distribution. Currently, there are two regulated substances present at this facility that exceed the Threshold Quantity (TQ) as defined within 40 CFR 68.130. Those substances are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.
