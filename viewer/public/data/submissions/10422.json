The plant primarily manufactures anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) that provide Farmlands half million producer-members with high-quality, cost effective nutrients for the crops they grow to feed families around the world.  As a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing operation, this facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agencys Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require for facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan requirements include submission of the risk management plan to include hazard assessments defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Farmland Industries, Inc., Beatrice Nitrogen Plant at Beatrice, Nebraska.\n\n Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n \n The Beatrice Nitrogen Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility consisting of a large scale natural gas feed ammonia production unit and an integrated urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) production unit.  These products are primarily used as agricultural fertilizers.  Carbon dioxide production is also a segment of facility operations.\n \n Initial operation began in 1965. The original small UAN unit was replaced in 1969 with a larger plant, which was revamped and upgraded in 1998.\n \n The facility produces, handles, and stores large quantities of anhydrous ammonia in its operations.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water for the production of ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with by product carb"

Ammonia and air in the same plant are used to produce nitric acid that is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate. The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product.\n \n Each of these production units along with the ammonia storage and handling constitute the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management Program rule.  Regulated substances include the primary product of the plant, anhydrous ammonia, which is also the main feed stock for urea-ammonium nitrate production.  In addition, flammable substances as a class: methane (natural gas), and hydrogen (produced as an intermediate in ammonia production), specifically are regulated under Risk Management.  Finally, chlorine is also present in regulated threshold quantities on the site.  It is used as a biological control agent in the cooling water systems associated with the production units.\n \n \n Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n \n The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases from this facility.  It is this facilitys policy to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substance and, in particular, hazardous and regulated substances; and to minimize and eliminate to the extent possible even minor and inconsequential releases of any type.  Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of this plant, to the safety of its employees, and to the safety of the general public.\n \n To achieve its goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\n \n7 A knowledgeable and highly trained and motivated employee group\n7 A well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n7 Improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention where appropriate\n7 Excellence in safety programs and practices and a superior safety and acciden"

      "SummaryText": " five years.\n\nSynopsis of Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management Plan rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility, the regulated substances include anhydrous ammonia and chlorine as regulated toxics, and flammables as a class, which include methane and hydrogen.  The rule requires an analysis of the worst case toxic as that scenario affecting the greatest distance and a worst case flammable accident as a vapor cloud explosion.  Alternate scenarios, which are more reasonably likely events, for each regulated toxic and flammables in general, must also be presented.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release-Anhydrous Ammonia\nConsidering the seasonal nature of fertilizer use and application in agriculture, large quantities of the ammonia produced at this facility must be stored until needed by the ultimate consumer.  The RMP rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst case event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nFor this facility, the largest single quantity of anhydrous ammonia is held in the atmospheric storage tanks, each of which contains 33,000 tons.  However, the worst release pertains to the 200-ton anhydrous ammonia high-pressure non-diked bullet tank.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire amount is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of a single tank.  A publicly available model (DEGADIS) which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release events modeled this unlikely event.   Details of the results of this modeling are provided elsewhere in the Risk M"

      "SummaryText": "anagement Plan submittal.\n\nTo assure that the event indicated above was, in fact, the worst case as the rule defines it; failure of the other on-site ammonia storage tanks, were also modeled.  In addition, a worst case failure of chlorine containers was similarly modeled.  Neither of these resulted in a distance greater than the circumstance noted above.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst case is so low as to be non-existent.  Analysis of this unlikely scenario was completed as required by the rule.  Facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, and preclude such massive and improbable failures.\n\nWorst Case - Flammable\nAs the rule requires, the largest quantity flammable release and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion must be analyzed as the worst case for these substances.  In this facility, a failure releasing the entire contents of the ammonia synthesis loop constitutes the largest flammable release.  This quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look up Tables. Although large volumes of flammable gases are handled daily by the plant, actual in-process inventory is relatively small, considering the quantity of inert gases and steam mixed with the flammable gases.  Consequently, impact distance is relatively limited as a result.\n\nAlternate Case Toxics \n\nAmmonia\nMore reasonable and likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as in the loading and other transport activities.  Significantly lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards are present as they are throughout the plant, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.  Such events can include failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario, modeled with the DEGADIS model for this facilit"

Modeled impact distance is substantially lower for more reasonable, but not necessarily likely, release events. \n\nChlorine\nChlorine is used at several locations in this plant as a biocide agent for cooling water systems, much as it is also used in swimming pools.  It is used as a gas from one ton chlorine cylinders through an injection system to the circulating cooling water.\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumed is failure of the connecting tubing from the cylinder and release of gaseous chlorine.  This release was also modeled using the DEGADIS dispersion model.\n\nFlammables\nLarge volumes of flammable gases are handled throughout the plant, even though actual physical inventory is relatively low.  More likely flammable release events include failures of smaller pipes and lines in comparison to the large release contemplated in the worst case analysis.\n\nMore reasonable and likely events result in minimal impact distances.  The alternate scenario assumed a vapor cloud explosion as a result of a pressure relief valve in the ammonia synthesis loop lifting for a duration of 4 minutes.  The impact distance of this event utilized the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look Up Tables. \n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the plant, which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously, as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
