      "SummaryText": "1. Purpose:\n\nFranklin Area Wastewater Treatment Plant (FAWWTP) processes 3.2 mgd of water from the communities of Carlisle, Germantown, Franklin and unincorporated areas of Montgomer and Warren Counties. The FAWWTP is a secondary treatment facility. The chief objective of secondary treatment is to reduce the concentration of dissolved and colloidal organic matter contained in the wastewater that cannot be removed by primary treatment. Chlorine is added to the secondary clarifier effluent between May 1 and October 31 each year. Sulfur dioxide is then added to remove residual chlorine before final dishcarge to the Great Miami River.\n\n2. Storage:\n\nChlorine is delivered to the treatment plant in one-ton containers. By administrative control, a maximuim of 2 one-ton containers of liquid chlorine is stored on site in the chlorine storage room.\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\nThe FAWWTP Risk Management Program (RMP) includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards.\n- Operator Training\n- Preventive maintenance program\n- Process specific safety equipment\n- Safe and effective standard operating procedures, written with operatior participation\n- Hazard review of equipment and procedures\n- Auditing and inspection programs\n- Comprehensive management Program\nFurther, FAWWTP maintains an active environmental, health and safety program with the following elements specifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the chlorination process.\n- Respirator protection (SCBA) program\n- Chlorine detectors\n- Chemical right to know program\n- Personal protective equipment program\n\n4. Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nTwo lift station are equipped with manual clean Bar/ basket to remove material which will readily float and settle. Activated sludge process is a method of biological secondary treatment. The primary clarifier is a nine million gallon lagoon"

      "SummaryText": "equipped with fine bubble diffusers. Chlorine is delivered to the treatment plant in one-ton containers. A maximum of 2 containers of liquid chlorine is stored on site in the chlorine storage room. Chlorine is added to the secondary clarifier effluent between May 1 and October 31 each year. Sulfur dioxide is then added to remove residual chlorine befoe final dishcarge to the Great Miami River.\n\n5. Worst-Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario as postulated in the regulation (40 CFR 68.25) is the release of the greatest quantity (of chlorine) in a single vessel. The entire contents of the vessel are assumed to be released as a gas over a 10-minute period. The largest single vessel at the treatment plant is a one-ton container; therefore, 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine will be released as a gas over a 10 minute period. A release of this magnitude would only be possible if the shell of the container failed and the liquid chlorine formed a pool and vaporized over a 10 minute period. The likelihood of this type of catastophic release is minimal. According to EPA model RMP*Comp A\u00c2\u00bf, using the rural site option, the distance to the endpoint is 3.0 miles. There are 17 schools, one hospital and a population of 31,603 within a 3 mile radius of the facility.\nThe meteorolgical conditions associated with the worst-case scenario, is a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and very stable atmospheric conditions. The stable atmospheric will limit the mixing of the chlorine gas with the ambient air as the gas travels downwind from the point of release. The cloud formed by the chlorine release will grow in  and decrease in concentration as it travels downwind.\n\n6. Alternative - Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe alternate release scenario would be a very small release with the vacuum system in place. If anything from the cylinder to the feed equipment gets cut, broken off or loosened the head on the chlorine cylinder would shut do to the lack of vacuum, with no discharge to the atmosp"

      "SummaryText": "here.\n\n7. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The chlorine system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with applicable codes and state law.\nThe treatment plant maintains a SCBA and Chlorine Institute's Emergency Kit \"B\" for one-ton containers. This equipment is stored in a room that is adjacent to the room that houses the ton containers. FAWWTP personnel receive training on the use of the breathin apparatus and the emergency kit. The kit contains vlave leaks and repair small holes in a ton container and capping devices for the fusible plugs in the ton containers. Ton containers are equipped with fusible metal pressure relief devices. Most ton containers have six fusible plugs, three in each end. The fusible plug is designed to melt between 158 degrees F and 165 degrees F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or other exposure to high tempature.\nChlorine gas is heavier than air and will settle to the lowest elevation when released. The chlorine storage area is equipped with an exhaust fan that is mounted near the floor on an exterior wall. There are also air intake vents located near the floor so that the chlorine gas will be vented outside the building. The fan can be activated by a switch located outside the building and also by a switch inside the building. Two exit doors are provided in the chlorine storage room.\n\n8. Five - Year Accident History:\n\nFAWWTP has never had an accident involving chlorine that required hospitalization, care by a physician or that caused death, injury, property/ environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n9. Emergency Repsonse Program:\n\nThe FAWWTP has a site specific Emergency Repsonse Plan (ERP), that outlines employees procedures in the event of an emergency.\nThe Facility's ERP includes specific procedures"
