The Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant has also implemented all the elements of Williams Midstream?s System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.  \n\nThe Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant?s Emergency Response Plan is site-specific. It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant processes raw natural gas into methane and other natural gas liquids. The raw natural gas is received by gathering system pipelines. The finished products are delivered to various pipelines.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The plant has also implemented all the elements of Williams Midstream?s System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards. Key elements of these programs include:\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nOperating Procedures: The Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up,  (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, "

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR?s): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.  \n\nMechanical Integrity: The Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.  \n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined space entry permits and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed into a permit required confined space.  \n\nTraining: The plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  The program includes Classroom, OJT, and computer-based training. E"

The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.

Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant is shared and coordinated with San Juan County Emergency Management.  This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which include local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  The Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the San Juan County Emergency Management. The plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the San Juan County Emergency Management and emergency response organizations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant plans to install additional engineering safeguards and continued learning and training of employees and contractors. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulated substances."
