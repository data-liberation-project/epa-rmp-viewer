The DuPont-Joliet facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases of non-regulated materials over the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nDuPont-Joliet is a non-responding facility that responds to small incipient releases and provides first aid. The facility relies on the support from the local emergency response agencies and coordinates response with them.  The facility\u2019s response plan includes first aid and medical treatment, small spill response, evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. The plan is shared with the Channahon Fire Department and with the Will County LEPC."

      "SummaryText": "Facility Process and regulated chemical\n\nThe Dupont-Joliet facility produces polystyrene foam board using blowing agents of liquified and compressed gases and pelletized forms of resins, flame retardants and other additives. Blowing agents are stored in outside tanks and are transferred to the process where they are combined with the extruded molten polymer. This mixture is then cooled and dropped in pressure to produce a polystyrene board that is then trimmed and cut to the final size and packaged. One of those blowing agents is a regulated liquified flammable gas present at amounts greater than 50,000 lbs.\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility (overall approach to chemical safety)\n\nThe DuPont-Joliet facility is strongly committed to its employees, the public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating and emergency procedures, maintenance, 1st party assessments of processes, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to use DuPont methodologies to carryout hazard reviews are Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Reactive Chemicals / Process Hazard Analysis (RC/PHA) and to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances based on those reviews and implementation of loss prevention principles.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with the OSHA PSM rule and conducts comprehensive hazard analyses to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  Qualified personnel with expertise in process safety engineering and process operations revalidate these analyses at a regular interval.  In addition, the facility uses a number of tools to prevent incidents including monitoring devices, relief systems, red"
