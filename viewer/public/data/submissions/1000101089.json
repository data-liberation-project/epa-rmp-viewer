The Emergency action plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility:\r\n\r\n  1.) To save lives.\r\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.) To protect the environment.\r\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated incident commander for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\r\n\r\nFacility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures. In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger. The facility plant manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, was conducted for the facility in May 2022. An independent Mechanical Integrity Inspection was also completed in 2021. These assessments provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Llano Logistics facility. \r\n\r\nIn addition to these technical studies, the maintenance department and safety committee is plan"

      "SummaryText": "IAR). In addition, the facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 regulation. This included conducting an initial PHA to examine potential release scenarios and identify measures to reduce the consequences and/or likelihood of such events. The PHA has been revalidated every five years.  The PSM prevention programs included developing written operating and maintenance procedures as well as other policies and programs to manage the handling of ammonia at the facility (Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Employee Training, and Participation, etc.). \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow facility personnel to monitor system operations. This monitoring system is comprised of liquid level controls, pressure and temperature controls and indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility personnel to effectively monitor and control refrigeration operations. \r\n\r\nThe facility is equipped with ammonia gas detectors located in the Engine Room and in the warehouse. \r\n\r\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator. The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases. Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nBased on the EPA RMP coded definition of accident, an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted on May 17, 2022, revealed that there have been no incidents that meet the EPA RMP definition criteria of accident in the last five years (May 2017 - May 2022). However, there were two incidents in 2020 that exceeded the National"

      "SummaryText": "ion Center uses anhydrous ammonia to provide refrigeration for a cold storage operation and has a maximum intended inventory of 27,000 pounds (engineered calculation of 26,200 pounds). The Ice Plant uses 7,500 pounds for the production of ice. Both processes are closed loop systems, which operate continuously. Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation. Cold storage and dock areas use evaporators to maintain room temperatures in the Distribution Center and four Ice Makers are used to freeze water at the Ice Plant. Both systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage and dock areas.\r\n\r\nThe Ice Plant system containing 7,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the smaller charge but base on the high pressure liquid receiver being located outside, it was used for calculating the worst case scenario because the potential loss would be greater.\r\n\r\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of the ammonia refrigeration equipment is located inside the respective engine room. The condensers are mounted on each engine room roof and the evaporators are placed in their respective dock or storage areas. Access to the engine room is limited to authorized personnel.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe facility operates in accordance with the suite of standards published by International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (I"
