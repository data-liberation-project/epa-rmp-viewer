Our hazard analysis shows that with even minimal preventive measures in place, this  scenario is practically not possible.  \n     The next most likely scenario we could propose, our alternate worst case, is also extremely unlikely to occur and would result in a release of only 28 lbs in less than one minute.  Within that time, safety features engineered into our process would detect and automatically shut off the flow of chlorine, ending the release.  \n     Following are some of the precautions and procedures in place to prevent accidental releases including the worst case and alternate release scenarios described in this report.\n\nAccident Prevention\n     While preparation for response to a release is important, our primary goal is to prevent one from ever happening.  Our prevention program, in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Risk Management Planning regulations, ensures that regulated substances are safely stored, used and handled.  The West Carrollton Mill's accident prevention program consists of the following elements.\n     Process Safety Information:  We have compiled information to assist our employees who operate the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by it.  This information comes from Material Safety Data Sheets and our chlorine and equipment suppliers.\n     Process Hazard Analysis:  A hazard evaluation has been preformed by an experienced team to identify, assess and control the hazards involved in each part of the process.  Using what if scenarios and checklists, the team periodically evaluates the entire process for hazards.  In addition, the team reviews all incidents that occurred since their last evaluation for their potential to result in a release.  They examine engineering controls for situations that could result in failure and administrative controls and operating procedures for potential consequences of deviations from them.  \n     Operating Procedures:  Written procedures"

      "SummaryText": "The paper mill operated by Appleton Papers Inc. at West Carrollton, Ohio (West Carrollton Mill) has been in operation at its current location since 1948.  It was purchased by Appleton Papers Inc. in 1984.  We at the West Carrollton Mill are proud to be part of a company that has earned a reputation as an innovative producer of carbonless and thermal papers used in a variety of commercial printing and specialty applications.  Our 460 member workforce is made up of employees in production, maintenance, engineering, technical, clerical and management roles.  Many of our employees have been with the company or employed at this location for 25 years or more.  In many cases, multiple members of the same families earn their living here, parents and children, siblings, cousins, aunts/uncles and nieces/nephews.  Most live within a few miles of the mill and are raising their families in West Carrollton and neighboring communities.\n     Safety, of our employees and of the community is a high priority at Appleton Papers Inc. and at the West Carrollton Mill.  We recognize that every person is irreplaceable and that injury or loss of live is devastating to whole families.  We recognize the responsibility to our employees and the community that goes along with using hazardous chemicals.\n     We have eliminated the use of pure ammonia as a nutrient in our wastewater treatment process replacing it with a less hazardous, liquid product.  We have reduced the amount of propane stored on site to power forklifts and changed our storage method from a large tank to small cylinders. We have minimized the use of chlorine, for example, by eliminating its use for the treatment of our process water.  Its only remaining use at the West Carrollton Mill is for the bleaching of recycled paper pulp.\n     The West Carrollton Mill recycles 360 tons of wastepaper every day.  That's over 250 million lbs of paper every year that would otherwise go to a landfill.  Chlorine is used at the West Carroll"

We have begun   the process of choosing a suitable replacement for chlorine in our process that will still allow us to produce paper from recycled fiber that meets our customers' requirements.\n     There are three primary components of our Risk Management Plan.  Following is an overview of how we are effectively protecting the safety of our employees and the community through:\n     7 Hazard Assessments\n     7 Accident Prevention\n     7 Emergency Response Planning\n\nHazard Assessment\n     In addition to identifying and planning to prevent a worst case or alternative release, we periodically examine every part of the process that contains chlorine.  Each piece of equipment, every pipe, every fitting, every valve, every control loop is analyzed to identify what might go wrong and how to prevent it.  For each situation identified, we plan a solution to eliminate that potential cause of a release.  The solutions are carried out as quickly as possible and their progress is tracked until all are complete.\n     In addition, as required by the Risk Management Planning regulations we modeled our worst and alternative release scenarios using EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis model.  Air dispersion models are limited in their ability to accurately predict the impact of a chemical release.  Their limitations increase as the complexity of the topography surrounding the release site increases.  Although the model assumes almost no wind and flat terrain, buildings and terrain features such as hills would disrupt and redirect airflow.  The model also assumes no reaction with the ground, air or water.  However, it is likely that some of the chlorine would be consumed in reactions with elements found in the environment.\n     EPA's worst case scenario requires facilities to predict the path of a release of the entire contents of our largest vessel in 10 minute"

Management ascertains and documents that each employee has received and understood the training.\n     Mechanical Integrity:  The West Carrollton Mill has developed a comprehensive maintenance program that applies to tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps  in the covered process.  Written procedures, training for process maintenance activities, monthly inspection and testing, prompt correction of equipment deficiencies and quality assurance are all included in this program.\n     Management of Change:  Written procedures have been established and implemented to assure that changes made to the process will have no adverse impact on safety.  This process is a HAZOP analysis that looks at all possible impacts of the change.  Any proposed change that increases the likelihood of a release won't be made.  The management of change procedures include review and approval, provisions for documentation of the change in all other areas of the accident prevention program and requirements for training.

Emergencies for which we have planned responses include not only chemical release, but also fire, explosion, floods and severe weather, including tornadoes.\n     These plans begin with internal warning alarms, a chain of command and specific responsibilities for key employees.   An emergency response team known as the Mill Emergency Organization responds to fires and chemical spills (except chlorine), provides first aid and coordinates evacuation of the mill if necessary including during a chlorine emergency.  A second team consisting of the employees who work with chlorine and know the processes the best, is known as the Chlorine Response Team.  They have the equipment and training to respond to, isolate and repair leaks in the chlorine system.  Should the Chlorine Response Team or the Mill Emergency Organization feel that the community is threatened, the community emergency response plan is activated.  \n     The community emergency response plan is activated by contacting the West Carrollton Fire Department for assistance.
