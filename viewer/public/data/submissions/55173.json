Mammoth Pacific is extremely diligent in the handling of isobutane and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Mammoth Pacific staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using isobutane for geothermal power production.\nMammoth Pacific has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Isobutane System.  Mammoth Pacific?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of isobutane. \n    Stationary Source and Regulated Subsnce:\nMammoth Pacific?s geothermal power production facility is fueled by geothermal brine from nearby Casa Diablo Hot Springs, located in Mammoth Lakes, California, approximately 5 miles east of the City of Mammoth Lakes and 0.5 miles east of State Route 395. The area around the facility is rugged and generally uninhabited. The facility uses isobutane as a binary working fluid in a Rankine cycle for power production. There are a total of three plants in the facility: G1 (Mammoth Pacific I, MP I); built in 1984, and plant G2 (Mammoth Pacific II, MP II) and G3 (Pacific Lighting Energy Systems I, PLES I), built in 1990.  \nMammoth Pacific Limited Partnership is a partnership between Ormat and Constellation Energy Group. The facility utilizes hot geothermal brine as a energy source in a binary Rankine cycle with isobutane as the working fluid. Thermal energy from the brine is transferred to the isobutane as it is vaporized, pressurized, compressed, and cooled "

The electricity generated by this process is then sold to Southern California Edison.\nThe site is currently operated by Mammoth Pacific staff and is manned 24 hrs a day. The facility employs approximately 21 personnel.\nThe regulated substance managed at the Facility is isobutane. Isobutane participates in a closed-loop power cycle, traveling through accumulators, compressors, heat exchangers, turbines, and condensers in order to produce electricity. The maximum intended inventory is 526,500 lbs of isobutane, the majority of which is contained in the isobutane accumulators. \n    Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Anasis:\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for each of the two geothermal power production systems.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab 2 of the CalARP Submittal Binder.\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Two alternative release scenarios were modeled. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab 2 of the CalARP Submittal Binder.\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the use of isobutane has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Mammoth Pacific has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the vapor cloud explosion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics o"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\nThe facility?s maximum intended inventory of isobutane is 526,500 lbs.  Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 lbs threshold quantity for EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities.  As a result, the isobutane covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3 and Cal/OSHA PSM.\nThe Isobutane Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n?
