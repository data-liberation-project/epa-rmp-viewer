      "SummaryText": "Palermo Villa, Inc., d/b/a Palermo's Pizza in Milwaukee, Wisconsin operates a plant which makes frozen food products.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at the plant.  We have complied with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) standard since the refrigeration system was designed and installed in 2006.  To date we have not experienced any accidents which have resulted in the release of anhydrous ammonia.  Palermo's Pizza meets or exceeds the accidental release prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP  and OSHA's PSM standards including inspections, operator training, and conducting process hazard analyses.  We have coordinated our emergency response plan with the City of Milwaukee Fire Department and the Milwaukee County Sheriff - Emergency Management Bureau.\n\nPalermo's Pizza is currently in the process of expanding its plant and the associated refrigeration system.  We are using the recommendations from past process hazard analyses and our operating experience to improve the safety of the refrigeration system during this expansion.  Palermo's is continuously reviewing and upgrading our safety, health and environmental programs.  Contact us if you would like to review the alternative or worst-case release scenarios described in this report.\n"
