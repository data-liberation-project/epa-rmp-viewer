The Plan is designed to ensure that MCP responds effectively to emergency situations to protect MCP personnel, the public and environment. The ER Plan includes a designated Emergency Coordinator with written procedures to be followed in the event of a BD leak or release. The EC will coordinate with local emergency responders such as the Harrisburg Fire department, Hazmat responders and be responsible for emergency notifications to the police, medical responders and governmental agencies. \n\nResponse procedures include activation of alarm systems,deluge and fire pump systems,SDS information, response equipment and site plans. An LEL alarm system is tied into the plant control room at the Charlotte facility.  MCP personnel are routinely trained on fire responses, spill prevention and countermeasures and hazardous material handling. Contract response companies are also available for emergencies.\n\nMCP is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee."

      "SummaryText": "The Mallard Creek Polymers(MCP)Speed-rail facility periodically receives 1,3-Butadiene (BD)via rail car. The BD is transferred into tanker trucks for transport to the MCP facility located at 2800 Morehead Road in Charlotte NC, approximately 10 miles away. The BD is then used in  manufacturing operations at the MCP Morehead facility.  MCP conducts a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) at five (5) year intervals or when changes occur or new projects are implemented. MCP follows Good Engineering Practices (GEP), utilizes a computerized preventative maintenance and documented Mechanical Integrity programs conducted by qualified personnel. The OSHA Mechanical Integrity program includes critical equipment checks and testing to confirm /validate reliability. All equipment modifications are formally reviewed and approved through a Management of Change process by qualified personnel and before equipment is placed into service.  The site was audited on 1/29/2019 by NCDEQ with no findings.\n\nRoutine inspections and audits of the Speed-Rail safety programs are conducted both internally by the EHS and process engineering groups as well as external inspectors from the local fire department and Insurance carrier inspectors. The Speed-Rail facility utilizes a formal documented Accident / Incident reporting system to include near misses. This process reviews all incident to identify the root cause for prevention and follow-up. \n\nThe Speed-Rail facility is normally unmanned unless transfer operations are being conducted. One(1)employee is present when transfers are being made.During those periods when the Speed-Rail is unmanned, the site is monitored remotely 24 hours per day by the MCP Morehead facility. When BD transfers are being made from a rail car to a tanker truck, trained operators are present who possess the skill and ability to complete the BD transfer. Formal written procedures are followed during the transfer of the BD. Monitoring and safety procedures include safety interlocks,"
