      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Valero LP - Laredo Products Terminal\n\nWe at the Valero LP ? Laredo Products Terminal are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass the storage and sale of motor fuel.  We have two  regulated substances present at our facility above the threshold quantity:  propane/butane mix, which  is used to separate pipeline tenders, and ethyl mercaptan, which is used for odorizing propane before sale.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative scenarios, we have used the EPA's online modeling software, RMP*Comp?.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe Valero LP ? Laredo Terminal has invested a great deal of time and effort to reduce the potential of any hazardous material release.  These efforts include the stringent design codes that the facility is built to, the routine inspections and monitoring that are performed daily, as well as the periodic internal inspections and repairs.\n\nThe combination of these four systems ensures that small releases will be addressed quickly and even large releases can be effectively mitigated with no impact on the surrounding community.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from propane pipeline interface storage.  In this scenario 258,707  lb. of propane pipeline interface is released from one of the storage tanks without consideration for emergency shutdown valves or operator action.  The vessel is assumed to be completely full, and that the entire quantity is released as a vapor.  The "

      "SummaryText": "vapor then finds an ignition source, with ten percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance to the 1 psi endpoint will have offsite impacts.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release of propane pipeline interface.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 5,125 pounds of propane pipeline interface in ten minutes from a leak in a pipe.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include operator action and Emergency Shut Off valves.  After comparing the effects of fire and overpressure, the vapor cloud explosion scenario was chosen as worse than fire.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure would involve offsite effects.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nValero LP - Laredo Products Terminal maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with our facility were identified and controlled effectively.  The methodology used to carry out this analysis is a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The study was undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will revalidat"
