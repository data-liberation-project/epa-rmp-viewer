This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass the storage and sale of motor fuel.  We have two  regulated substances present at our facility above the threshold quantity:  propane/butane mix, which  is used to separate pipeline tenders, and ethyl mercaptan, which is used for odorizing propane before sale.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative scenarios, we have used the EPA's online modeling software, RMP*Comp\u00bf.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe Valero LP \u00bf Laredo Terminal has invested a great deal of time and effort to reduce the potential of any hazardous material release.  These efforts include the stringent design codes that the facility is built to, the routine inspections and monitoring that are performed daily, as well as the periodic internal inspections and repairs.\n\nThe combination of these four systems ensures that small releases will be addressed quickly and even large releases can be effectively mitigated with no impact on the surrounding community.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from propane pipeline interface storage.  In this scenario 258,707  lb. of propane pipeline interface is released from one of the storage tanks without consideration for emergency shutdown valves or operator action.  The vessel is assumed to be completely full, and that the entire quantity is released as a vapor.  The"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Completing a Pre-Startup Safety Review and implementing a comprehensive mechanical integrity testing and inspection program are some of the major steps we are taking to improve safety at our facility.  These changes will be  implemented with the startup of the propane handling operation and will be continuous."

Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance to the 1 psi endpoint will have offsite impacts.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release of propane pipeline interface.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 5,125 pounds of propane pipeline interface in ten minutes from a leak in a pipe.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include operator action and Emergency Shut Off valves.  After comparing the effects of fire and overpressure, the vapor cloud explosion scenario was chosen as worse than fire.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure would involve offsite effects.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nValero LP - Laredo Products Terminal maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with our facility were identified and controlled effectively.  The methodology used to carry out this analysis is a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The study was undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will revalidat"

Findings related to the hazard analysis were addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Valero LP - Laredo Products Terminal maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nValero LP - Laredo Products Terminal has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nValero LP - Laredo Products Terminal carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations.  These personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Valero LP - Laredo Products Terminal to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nValero LP - Laredo Products Terminal promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nValero LP - Laredo Products Terminal believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Valero LP - Laredo Products Terminal has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor\u00bfs work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5"
