              "Description": "The silane system has several preventative elements which ensure a safe and leak free operation.\n\nA HAZOP was performed on the silane system in May of 1999. This HAZOP was performed by Air Liquide personnel who have had extensive experience with silane. Recommendations from the HAZOP are now under review . Recommendations that are accepted have a projected implementation of 12/99.\n \nA visual inspection of the silane system is carried out  prior to each use. Silane leakage will leave a white or brownish type staining (silicon dioxide powder) on the system components where leakage has occurred. Following the visual inspection a  leak check with high pressure helium gas is performed at the working pressure of the system.  A final pre-startup preventative step is a vacuum leak check of the system. The system must maintain a specified vacuum level for a period of time to confirm there are no leaks in the system. The pressure and vacuum pre-startup checks ensure the system is leak free prior to any silane entering the system.\n\nWhen the transfilling of silane is taking place only the required amount  of the bulk source unit  valves are open while the remainder of the bulk unit valves are kept closed. This minimizes the amount of product that could escape should a leak develop. This also reduces the time the operator will need to shutdown the system if an emergency occurs on the silane system or anywhere else in the plant which warrants a plant evacuation. At the end of each day the bulk product source unit  valves are closed and the fill system is emptied of silane.\n\nAll filling of silane is monitored by weight and pressure using calibrated scales and gauges. This cross check between weight and pressure minimizes the possiblity for any overfill condition to occur.\n \nThe silane system is designed with a minimal amount of threaded connections and is welded where ever possible.  All piping is 316L grade stainless steel.  All valves on the silane system and bulk product sources are of a tied diaphragm or bellows design which offers the highest leak free integrity. Emergency shutdown buttons allow the operator to quickly stop the flow of product to the cylinders being filled should the need arise.\n\nSilane greatest hazard is its fire potential. The manifold where the cylinders are connected for filling is in a room rated at Class I, Division II. The system incoporates a fire detection/suppressant system at the fill system and bulk source.",

              "Description": "The hydrogen chloride system has a relatively basic design as compared to most chemical processes.  The system consist of a bulk product source which is a tube trailer of hydrogen chloride piped a short distance into the plant where the fill operation of cylinders take place. Between the tube trailer and the cylinders being filled is a minimal amount of piping and valves.\n\nA HAZOP was performed on the hydrogen chloride system in May of 1999. Recommendations from the HAZOP are under review. The recommendations which are accepted have a projected implementation date of 12/99.\n\nPreventative program elements are in place to ensure the hydrogen chloride system operates safely and maintains a leak free status.\nOn a daily basis the operator performs a visual inspection of the hydrogen chloride system for any signs of leakage which would manifest itself as external corrosion or discoloration on system parts. After a visual inspection the system is given a pressure leak check with helium gas up to the system working pressure. The system must be certified leak free prior to any introduction of hydrogen chloride.  \n\nThe hydrogen chloride tube trailer consists of  6 tubes. However, only one tube is open at any one time. This minimizes the amount of product in the system if a leak occurred and also reduces the amount of time the operator would need to shutdown the product source should an emergency warrant it. In addition,  hydrogen chloride gas is withdrawn from the tube trailer gas phase instead of liquid phase which greatly reduces the volume of product to deal with should a leak develop. When the system is not in use all tubes of the trailer are kept closed.\n\nHydrogen chloride is a corrosive product. The entire fill system is constructed of 316L stainless steel or hastelloy material. These metals offer the highest resistance to hydrogen chloride corrosion. The system is periodically disassembled and washed out which prevents corrosive reactions from occurring. All system components are baked out to remove moisture which is a catalyst for corrosion propagation.\n\nThe weight of  hydrogen chloride in the bulk source tube trailer and into the cylinders filled from this source are monitored on calibrated weight scales. This monitoring prevents the possibility of an overfill condition. The maximum allowable product fill density (the allowable amount of product that can be put in a cylinder) is  governed  by the Department of Transportation. This maximum fill density has a built in safety cushion which further minimizes the possibility of an overfilled condition.",

Bulk product source units containing 2000 lbs. of chlorine are emptied through a system into smaller size cylinders. The system has a minimal amount of valves and piping.\n\nThe preventative program elements in place for the chlorine system are the following.\n\nThe chlorine system is given a daily visual inspection for the purpose of detecting any leaks. Chlorine leaks would be evident from signs of external corrosion or discoloration on system parts. Prior to each use the system is subjected to a pressure leak check with helium up to the working pressure of the system. The system must be leak free before any chlorine is introduced into the system.\n\nThe chlorine system is constructed of 316L stainless steel to minimize any corrosive effects from the chlorine. A minimal amount of threaded connections are incorporated in the system.  The system is periodically disassembled , washed and baked out to remove any trace moisture. This periodic cleaning removes potential corrosive sites in the system while the baking step's main purpose is the removal of moisture which is the prime catalyst for corrosion to begin in the system.\n\nThe weight of product received in the bulk product source (ton)  and the cylinders filled from the ton are monitored with calibrated scales.  The product fill density (the amount of product allowed in a certain size cylinder)  is governed by the Department of Transportation. This value has a built in safety cushion to further prevent the accidental overfill of a cylinder.\n\nGaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the bulk source cylinder instead of liquid phase. This minimizes the volume of product to contend with should a leak develop on the system. The bulk product source chlorine ton is closed at the end of each or when not in use.\n\nThe chlorine system is contained entirely in a process building. This passive mitigation situation results in a much smaller dispersion distance from a product release.",

Some of these gases are very familiar to the public. For example, helium, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. The properties of the gases filled at the Morrisville plant range from nonreactive and non toxic to reactive and toxic. The compressed gases that fall under the RMP reporting requirements and  are used at the Morrisville plant are chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and silane. \nThe Morrisville plant's primary activity is to fill product (compressed gases) from a  bulk product source into compressed gas cylinders. This type of activity is commonly referred to as  repackaging. Therefore the Morrisville plant activity is best described as a \"repackager of compressed gases\".\nThe Morrisville plant, like it corporate headquarters, fully supports the Responsbile Care Program and is active in all six codes of conduct which make up the program.     \nThe Morrisville plant maintains its own emergency response team which is fully trained to handle an emergency with any of the chemical products on property. The team has a fully equipped emergency response trailer which is capable of going over the road to emergencies outside the plant. Any emergency situations on plant property are handled from the plant's Command Post Building. This building was specifically built to act as command center for plant emergencies.  The command post is equipped with  emergency equipment, product information,  emergency contact phone list, and an independent phone line should the plant phone system go down or be inaccessible. \nThe Morrisville plant has an Off - Site Emergency Response Plan which is approved annually by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

Other key elements of the PSM Program which the Morrisville plant utilizes are Management of Change and Pre Startup Safety Review which assist plant management in monitoring the safety of a chemical process at the initial startup and throughout the lifetime of the process.\nMorrisville management is an active member of the local Community Mutual Aid Committee. This organization is comprised of local chemical companies and emergency service groups in the area such as the LEPC , fire departments, hospitals, and first aid personnel. Through this organization dialogue between the operating chemical plants and emergency services is maintained. New chemicals and processes, changes in regulatory and code requirements, training sessions, table top and live practice scenario drills make up the agenda. The committee meets approximately every 2 months.\nThe Morrisville plant has been  ISO - 9002 certified since February, 1994. This is a certification of the quality system performed by an independent third party auditer twice a year. Key elements of this certification include documentation control (e.g., procedures), training, calibration of process equipment, and inspection and testing of product. These same requirements are also critical for chemical process safety making the ISO -  9002 a strong asset where training and control of a process are necessary elements.\nThe Morrisville plant is equipped with a 24 hour, 7 day a week security and fire detection system with  links to local fire and police departments.  \nThe Morrisville plant has had no reportable accidental releases for the last 5 years.

All of these elements are documented, controlled, and monitored as detailed previously per ISO 9002 requirements and the Hazardous Communication Program.\nStandard operating procedures specify rigid leak testing and package preparation for all products. The primary concern for these steps is safety but the quality of the products must be of the highest level. The primary clientele for the Morrisville plant are electronics customers who use compressed gases in the process of making semiconductor chips. This application demands the purest raw materials be used in the process which includes the compressed gases. Very small leaks invisible to the naked eye or to standard leak testing techniques can be found prior to any introduction of product into a system or final package. This is accomplished by using sophisticated helium leak detection systems which have a far greater magnitude of sensitivity for finding leaks.\n\n\nWORST CASE/ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe following are the worst case and alternate case scenarios that have been formulated for the Morrisville plant products that are subject to the RMP plan. There are three products addressed in this document; silane, hydrogen chloride, and chlorine.\n\nSILANE - WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nSilane is a flammable gas which Morrisville receives as a bulk product source in an ISO container. An ISO container is very similiar to a standard gaseous tube trailer except that the container has the ability to be removed from its trailer chasis.This mobility allows this type of container to be placed on the deck of a ship for transportation overseas or be transported over land by railroad on a flatbed car.

The tubes are approximately 20 feet long and have a diameter of 22 inches.  There is a shutoff valve at each end of the tube. Each tube has its own safety relief devices at each end which activates due to a combination of excessive heat exposure and subsequent pressure buildup within the container. The manifold that interconnects the tubes has 2 main shutoff valves which can be used to withdraw product.These main manifold shutoff valves are  pneumatically actuated and are defined as  \"normally closed\" meaning that the valve will remain closed unless activated by pressure to its dome.\n \nTo determine the worst case scenario for silane Air Liquide conducted a hazardous operations analysis (HAZOP) on the silane system. The following was determinded to be the worst case scenario based on the experience and knowledge of the HAZOP team and the known history of silane in the compressed gas industry.\nEach tube on the silane ISO container contains a maximum of 588 pounds of product. This product limit is based on the standard operating procedures and practices in place. The product supplied in the ISO container is weighed in and rechecked prior to shipment to Morrisville. Upon arrival to Morrisville, the container is check weighed again ensuring no overfill of product has occurred. During the use of the Iso container numerous visual inspections and leak checks are performed. \n \nThe conclusion reached by the HAZOP team is that the worst case scenario would be a complete failure of one of the tubes on the ISO container which would release the tube contents of 588 pounds. This complete failure would come from the mechnical failure of the tube. \n\nThe likelihood of this occurence was given the HAZOP rating description of \"once in the lifetime of the plant or less than once in 100 years\"  which equates to virtually impossible.

Inspections includes a periodic 5 year requalification of each tube for structural integrity by a Department of Transportation certified testing facility. No tube has catastropically failed in silane service.  Each tube has an individual shutoff valve which keeps them isolated from each other. \n\nIf a tube of silane released its entire contents the distance calculated for a 1PSI overpressurization is 0.66 miles. This calculation was derived from the equations provided in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Manual for a worst case release of a flammable gas producing a 1PSI overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nSILANE - ALTERNATE SCENARIO\n\nThe determination of the alternate (\"most likely\") scenario for a  silane release was derived from the HAZOP analysis performed on the silane fill process by Air Liquide personnel at the Morrisville plant. A risk rating was assigned to each potential product release scenario. The risk rating is calculated from the combination of the likelihood of the scenario occurring and the severity of the scenario. The HAZOP analysis team was made up of members who have had extensive experience with silane and were well qualified to make these determinations.\n\nThe overall risk rating  value was the primary factor in choosing an alternate scenario. Also considered when the risk rating was fairly equal  for different scenarios was to choose the scenario with the largest potential release. This ensured that the largest affected zone was considered for emergency planning considerations. \n\nSilane is not only a flammable but has the property of being pyrophoric (spontaneously combustible) .

This is due to the limited amount of silane that could be  released and also  silane's pyrophoric property as detailed in the previous paragraph.\n\nThe alternate scenario chosen for silane was a  release from the main connection of  the ISO container manifold. This type of release will produce a jet fire. The data used to determine the amount of the silane released and the endpoint came from the Compressed Gas Association Silane Study (release rate) and the Charm Modeling Program, Version 9.1  (endpoint) . These data sources were used to calculate the scenario because of silane's unique pyrophoric properties which limit the use of standard type formulas and assumptions. These calculations determined the entire tube (588 lbs.) would release through the main manifold connection given a mitigation repsonse time of 10 minutes. The reponse time of 10 minutes is a very conservative number. The mitigation steps Morrisville has in place will significantly reduce the time to isolate the leak source and minimize the damage. \n\nThe worst case and alternate case scenarios result in the same amount of product release but the difference is in the hazard condition they produce. The leak from the trailer main manifold connection will produce a jet fire where the worst case scenario was a catostrophic failure of the trailer tube producing a vapor clould explosion. \n\nThe main manifold connection has a 1/2\" tubing connected to it which feeds the supply of silane from the ISO container to the silane fill system.  There were several other scenarios in the HAZOP analysis that  were comparable in risk rating but this scenario offered the largest potential product release.\n\nThis silane release scenario will  have several active mitigation measures in place to minimize the consequence of this release"

      "SummaryText": ". The ISO container is positioned under a fire detection/suppressant sprinkler system. Once a fire is detected the sprinkler system will activate and begin to spray the ISO container manifold and immediate area. The primary purpose of the sprinkler system is to protect the surrounding area from fire. Since Silane is pyrophoric it will continue to produce a flame as long as there is a leak. \nThe ISO container has 2 pneumatically controlled header valves. The operator can remotely shut down the silane product source by cutting the nitrogen supply off that keeps these valves open and therefore stop the flow of silane and the leak out of the manifold connection.\nThe nitrogen that activates the pneumatic valves is supplied through plastic tubing. The choice of this material over a metal type supply piping was intentional. Should a leak of silane occur the heat and flames produced can melt the plastic, cut off the supply of nitrogen and close the pneumatic valves, resulting in the isolation of the product source.       \nIn summary, any of the perceived alternate scenarios that could develop into a silane release can be managed by the Morrisville emergency response plans in place. Silane's pyrophoric property minimizes the dispersion distance. \n\nHYDROGEN CHLORIDE - WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nHydrogen chloride is a toxic product which is received at the Morrisville plant in tube trailers.  Hydrogen Chloride is a liquefied gas under its own vapor pressure of 613 psig @ 70 degrees fahrenheit. The hydrogen chloride tube trailer consist of 6 tubes. Each tube is 40 feet long with a diameter of 24 inches. Each tube has a shutoff valve at each end and each tube incoporates a safety relief device at each end which is activated when the tube is exposed to elevated temepratures (165 degrees fahrenheit) and results in overpressurization of the tube.

It was determined that the worst case scenario would be the mechanical failure of a tube. This release would have off site consequences. The distance that was calculated from a worst case scenario was  2.4 miles as determined from the RMP Comp Version 1.06 modeling program. The likelihood HAZOP description rating assigned was \"once in a plant lifetime or less than once in 100 years\" which equates to virtually impossible. This determination was based on the administrative controls in place, the structural integrity of the tubes, and historical performance of hydrogen chloride in tube trailers for the industry. Administrative controls include monitoring of product filled into the trailer by the supplier and the recheck of this product weight when received at the Morrisville plant.  The product fill density, the amount of product allowed in a container as determined by the Department of Transportation, is established at a value which allows for temperature exposures up to 130 degrees fahrenheit and for small errors in overfilling. The standard operating procedures in place call out for numerous visual and leak check inspections of the hydrogen chloride system (which includes the trailer)while on property and in use. In addition, each tube in the trailer must be requalified for structural integrity every 5 years by a Department of Transportation certified testing agency.  \n\nHYDROGEN CHLORIDE - ALTERNATE SCENARIO\n\nThe determination of the alternate (\"most likely\") scenario for a product release on the hydrogen chloride system was derived from the HAZOP analysis conducted on the process by Air Liquide , Morrisville, Pa. plant personnel.\n\nThe potential product release scenarios developed from the HAZOP were each assigned a risk rating factor.

The HAZOP team personnel all had extensive experience with hydrogen chloride and were qualified to make these determinations.\n\nThe HAZOP produced several scenarios with comparable risk ratings. The scenario chosen was one that produced the most potential product release and would extent beyond the fence line of the Morrisville plant.\n\nThe alternate scenario chosen was the release of hydrogen chloride through a failed safety device on the end of one of the tubes of the hydrogen chloride trailer. \n  \nThe release rate was calculated by Air Liquide's Research and Development department utilizing formulas  specifically developed for the sudden release of a pressure vessel. The amount of release calculated for this scenario was 1300 pounds of hydrogen chloride. The endpoint was calculated at 0.5 miles using the RMP Comp Version 1.06 modeling program.The release duration was established at 30 minutes which was the estimated time needed to have the release under control. This endpoint will not encroach on any residential areas. \n\nThere are active and passive mitigation measures in place to minimize the amount of product released should this event occur.\n\nIn the event a release through a safety device would occur the remaining product in a tube can be transferred to another tube on the trailer or into empty containers. This action produces two results; 1) the product that could leak out is reduced and 2) the rapid transfer of product into another container produces a cooling effect on the leaking tube which in turn lowers the vapor pressure of the hydrogen chloride and the rate of leakage from the safety.\nThe hydrogen chloride scrubber can also assist in the process of emptying a tube with a leaking safety.\n\nTo reduce the travel of hydrogen chloride vapors  pass the property fence line a water spray supplied from the plant hydrant system positioned over the leaking safety will be used to knock down a substantial amount "

A passive mitigation measure is that hydrogen chloride will cool down in the event of a substantial leak . This in turn lowers the vapor pressure of the hydrogen chloride and results in lowering the leak rate.   \n\nCHLORINE  - WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nChlorine is supplied to the Morrisville plant in containers commonly known in the compressed gas industry as a \"ton container\" because they contain 2000 pounds of chlorine product.  Chlorine is a liquefied gas under its own vapor pressure of 85 psig @ 70 degrees fahrenheit. The ton container has a cylindrical shape and lays in the horizontal position. It is typically moved around with a fork truck.  The ton is approximately 7 feet long and has diameter of 24 inches. This container style has been used for decades in industry for chlorine service.  The container has two valves installed at one end - one for vapor withdrawal and one for liquid withdrawal. It also has 6 safety devices - 3 at each end of the container which are temperature activated should the container be exposed to elevated temperatures (greater than 165 degrees fahrenheit).\nThe HAZOP analysis performed on the chlorine system determined the worst case scenario would be the mechanical failure of the ton container. This failure would result in the contents of the ton (2000 lbs.) being emptied in 10 minutes and have an endpoint of 0.9 miles as calculated from the RMP Comp Version 1.06 modeling program. The release distance would not encroach on any residential areas. \nThe HAZOP description rating assigned to this was \"once in a plant lifetime or less than once 100 years\"  which equates to virtually impossible. The reasoning for this HAZOP likelihood rating was based on the administrative controls in place and the historical performance of the ton container in industry. \n\nThe chlorine system is completely housed in a process building"

Based on the data and information contained in the RMP Offsite Consequences Analysis Manual the building will reduce the release rate down to 55% of its original calculated value of 2000 pounds to a value of 1100 pounds.  Air Liquide agrees that this number is the minimum reduction the building enclosure will provide. This value was incorporated in the equation for calculating the endpoint for the worst case scenario. \nThe chlorine ton containers are visually checked,  leak checked , and product weight checked during and after fill by the supplier. The product fill density, the amount of product that can be put into a container as determined by the Department of Transportation, has been set at a value which allows for container temperature exposures up to 130 degrees fahrenheit and for small amounts of accidental overfilling. \nWhen chlorine containers are received at the Morrisville plant the same inspections the supplier has perfromed are repeated. In addition, the ton container must be requalified every 5 years by a Department of Transportation certified testing facility to verify its structural integrity. \n\n\nCHLORINE - ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe determination of the alternate (\"most likely\") scenario for a chlorine release was derived from the HAZOP  analysis performed on the chlorine fill process by Air Liquide personnel at the Morrisville plant.  A risk rating was assigned to each potential product release scenario. The risk rating is calculated from the combination of the likelihood of the scenario occurring and the severity of the scenario. \n\nThe risk rating value was the primary factor in choosing an alternate scenario.

This endpoint will not encroach on any residential areas. The amount of the release is based on a 30 minute response time needed to mitigate the leak. \n\nThe active and passive mitigation measures are as follows.\nIn the event a leak should develop at the safety device the safety can be capped using the emergency repsonse kit specifically designed for this type of container. The kit is called a \"Chlorine B Kit\" and is manufactured by the Chlorine Institute of America.  Once capped, the container can then be drained of all product and the safety replaced. \nThe contents of the container can also be sent to the scrubber or to another container which will lower the vapor pressure of the chlorine and slow the leak rate substantially.\nPassive mitigation is the fact that the chlorine fill system is contained within a 15,000 square foot building. This natural barrier will reduce the escape of gas down to at least 55% of its orignal release rate. This value is sourced from the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Manual and Air Liquide has incorporated this into the calculations for determining an endpoint."
