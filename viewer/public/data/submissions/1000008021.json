Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nWah Chang's basic commitment to responsible stewardship of the environment, protection of the community, protection of employee health, and assurance of product safety extends to the processes covered by the new EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Wah Chang (WC) facility at 1600 Old Salem Road in Albany, Oregon has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations which may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment.  This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nThe facility plans to meet or exceed regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at the facility have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  The RMP regulated chemicals include chlorine, aqueous ammonia, phosgene, and titanium tetrachloride. \nPrograms have been developed to comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and EPA's 40 CFR part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions in the Risk Management Program.  \n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to extract zirconium and hafnium from zircon sand and produce various metal products.  These products are sold to customers who produce final products for the nuclear industry, the industrial process industry and other related industries.  Zirconium chemical products as well as byproducts are also sold. \nThe regulated substances handled at this facility are chlorine,"

The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWah Chang has developed worst-case and alternative case release scenarios for each regulated substance.  The development of the worst-case scenario is dictated by the EPA.  The amount of the substance released for the worst-case scenario is equal to the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe line.  For toxic chemicals that are normally gases at ambient temperature and are handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the chemical is assumed to be released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The release rate to the atmosphere is calculated as the quantity released divided by 10 minutes unless passive mitigation is in place.   For toxic gases that are handled as refrigerated liquids at ambient pressure, if the released substance is not contained by passive mitigation systems or if the contained pool would have a depth of 1 cm or less, it is assumed that the substance is released as a gas over 10 minutes.  If the released substance is contained by passive mitigation systems in a pool with a depth greater than 1 cm, it was assumed that the quantity is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool and the release rate to the atmosphere was calculated at the boiling point of the substance. \nThe alternative case release scenarios for the regulated toxic substances were developed by WC based upon experience with the substances.  These scenarios are considered more likely to occur than the"

      "SummaryText": "worst-case release scenarios.  However, the alternative case release scenarios are still considered unlikely to occur.  As part of its release prevention program, discussed in detail in the next section, WC is constantly monitoring, reviewing, and upgrading its standard operating procedures and equipment.  In addition, WC has developed a detailed Emergency Action Plan (EAP)to minimize the effects of a release should one occur.  In addition to these administrative controls, WC has automatic release mitigation systems in place for the regulated substances, which are discussed below.  \nWith the exception of the worst-case scenario for phosgene, the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case and alternative case scenarios for each substance was calculated using EPA's RMPComp computer modeling program.   The Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) model version 2.1 was used to calculate the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario for phosgene.   The RMPComp model is considered conservative and would generally give longer distances than computer model developed specifically for WC.\n\nFor the following reasons the 2004 modeling used to calculate distance to the toxic endpoint continues to be valid:\n*Amounts of regulated substances handled at WC have not changed.\n*The 2000 U.S. Census data remains the most current; the next U.S. Census will occur in 2010.\n*The worst-case and alternative case scenerios are unchanged.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements which will help the facility to minimize releases of regulated substances.
