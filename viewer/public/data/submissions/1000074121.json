After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.), they can work independently. All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nF. Contractors\r\n\r\nSweeny Refinery uses contractors as part of its regular work force and during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to help verify contractors have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of the potential hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules and procedures, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they may discover during the course of their work. Various information is communicated and provided to contractors to help accomplish this to include:\r\n- Process overviews,\r\n- Information regarding safety and health hazards (e.g., SDSs),\r\n- Emergency Response Plan information,\r\n- Safe work practices applicable to contractor work activities.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Sweeny Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as part of the contractor selection process. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to help ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. Meetings are held monthly with facility contractors and plant personnel to promote effective information sharing and to ensure site and work requirements are adequately communicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nG.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate priority attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked to completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in the facility formal corrective action tracking database.\r\n\r\nTo confirm the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Sweeny Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation.\r\n\r\nD. Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nSweeny Refinery maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, to include: unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Formal processes and procedures are developed and maintained through the Training Team to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date.\r\n\r\nE. Training\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program consisting of various job/certification models for all employees involved in operating a process.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nC. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nA formal PHA process is established to help ensure that potential process-related hazards are identified and controlled. Within this process, PHAs are conducted to systematically examine covered processes to identify potential process-related hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary method used to perform these PHA evaluations. Additional PHA tools and methodologies (e.g., Layers of Protection Analysis, What-If, etc.) are utilized based on need and appropriateness for the process under review. The PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise.

Two types of releases are to be considered, a Worst Case Scenario (WCS) and an Alternate Release Scenario (ARS). The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. The ARS represents a more credible, but still potentially significant, accidental release of a regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS. However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may not have been included to its fullest extent in order to create potential worst-case and alternate release scenarios. In helping to establish the Alternate Release Scenarios that are more credible and likely, various information such as previous incident history, PHA failure scenarios, siting and spacing studies, etc. were considered.\r\n\r\nNote: For Security purposes, the Offsite Consequence Analysis description and scenarios are not shown in the Executive Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.
