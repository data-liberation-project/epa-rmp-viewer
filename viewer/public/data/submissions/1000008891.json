The following areas are addressed in this summary:\n-Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n-Stationary Source Activities and Regulated Substances Handled\n-Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n-Emergency Response Program\n-Planed Changes to Improve Safety\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nDole Fresh Vegetables, Inc. (Dole) is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program.  Dole has developed their Risk Management Plan/Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document Dole policies that address the implementation of these regulations.  The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others.  The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nThe Dole Marina facility provides product cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT:\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\n\nNote: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system- in either design or operation.  The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM:\nDole?s Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.  The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA?s Process Safety Management Program (PS"

      "SummaryText": "M).  The Prevention Program implemented by Dole is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\n\nKey objectives of Dole?s Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1.Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Center).\n2.Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Dole. (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter).\n3.Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases.  (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation Chapters).\n4.Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Dole certified operators following completion of operator training and Dole?s confirmation of the operator?s ability apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training Chapter.)\n5.Employee involvement in Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operator?s day-today activities.\nSecond, all Dole employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive     ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM     information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees.  (Both     levels are addressed under Employee Participation Chapter.)\n6.Implementation of additional measu"

These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Dole?s Management of Change Procedure.\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Dole has a     procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company?s experience and     safety history.  Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other ?Hot Work? occurs     inside the building and close to the refrigeration system, a Dole Hot Work permit     is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is     to minimize the possibility of fire.\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is     required before the system can be started.  (These areas are addressed under     Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-    Startup Safety Review Chapters).\n7.Verification of Dole?s compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Dole personnel.  Dole has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find.  (Addressed under Compliance Audit Chapter).\n8.Minimize employee injury and illness.

Evacuation Drills are an important part of the training.\n\nUnder Dole?s Emergency Response policy, Dole employees who have been trained as ?First Responders? may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e., de-energizing equipment.)  Dole will evacuate affected areas, begin notification processes, and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department, refrigeration contractor).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study team developed recommendations to improve safety.  Key recommendations identified during the study include (partial listing):\n-Establish additional written procedures for practices and maintenance\n-Install additional eyewash stations\n-Confirm roof access ladders are OSHA approved\n-Address Thermosyphon oil cooler pressure relief\n-Label piping, valves and equipment, including electrical breakers\n-Confirm Compressor Room A & B ventilation is properly rated and controlled\n-Address floor drains safeguard\n-Address low piping in System B Refrigeration Rooms concern\n-Install oil pot in System B\n-Consider valve station changes to soften defrost on specific evaporators\n-Confirm corrosion inspection correction items are implemented\n-Expand preventative maintenance (PM) program\n-Critical valve tagging\n\nImplementation of the measures has begun according to the schedule set by Dole.\n\n\n\n"
