Polyurethane foam and prepolymer manufacturing facility\n\n\n\nThe polyurethane foam and prepolymer facility (see fig. 1) uses the risk management program (RMP) regulated substance 80:20 TDI (i.e., 80 wt% 2-4-TDI and 20 wt% 2-6-TDI) in the prepolymer manufacturing process.  The prepolymer product contains 3 wt% TDI and is stored in product containers for later use to produce polyurethane foam.\n\n\n\nThe closest public receptor to the TDI process equipment is Karlen manufacturing.  This business is about 206 ft. from the prepolymer manufacturing building, and 300 ft from the foam-manufacturing site.  We have a direct connection with the Tri-Township Fire Department for emergency response, as well as periodic inspections from Bayer Chemical to ensure a safe setup of the manufacturing facility.  The facility uses administrative controls to limit the amount of TDI present at any one time, as to maintain a TDI quantity safety factor.  The main TDI tank area is not only diked off, but enclosed in a separate room for isolation purposes.  This room can only exhaust air through a scrubber, which neutralizes TDI vapors.  All related personnel are trained at least annually and have access to all necessary safety equipment for proper handling.  Spill response training is also included for appropriate personnel.  Regular safety meetings update any need for changes to keep safety issues current.  The safe manner in which this facility is handled has resulted in no accidental releases in the history of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe following locations and equipment in the coatings manufacturing process handle TDI:\n\n\n\nThe TDI storage tank.  One 40,000-lb and one 50,000-lb indoor TDI storage tank stores TDI, and provides T"

TDI from the TDI storage tank is pumped to the 3000-LB reactor, where TDI is reacted with other substances to produce polyurethane prepolymer.  The prepolymer (10 wt%TDI) is then dumped into product containers, which are conditioned for use in the foam manufacturing area.  The reactor and storage tank are confined into a separate inner building area, which can be sealed off from the rest of the plant.\n\n Product containers.  A variety of product containers may be used for product containment, the largest and most widely used being a 3000-lb container (typically filled with 2800-lbs of product.)\n\n The TDI lines that connect the tank to the reactor.  The estimated 39-ft of line contain approximately 25 lbs. of TDI.\n\n  The foam production line stores up to 2-2,800 lbs. product containers of 10 wt% TDI.\n\n The mix head/lines.  The mix head mixes the prepolymer with the other polymerization reactants and discharges the mixture onto a conveyor belt.  The entire mix equipment contains up to 300 lbs. of the 10 wt% TDI.\n\n Conveyor system.  Polyurethane foam is created when the polymerization reactants are discharged from the mixing head onto the conveyor.  The equipment and handling downstream of the conveyor system handles only polyurethane foam and is not covered by the RMP rule requirements.\n\n\n\nGuidance on the worksheets for this process.\n\nThe following notes help explain some of the steps in filling out the worksheets for this process:\n\n\n\n The capacity of the piping is determined using equation 1 below:\n\nCapacity = (75.8 pcf) x (3.14) x (0.0521)2 = 25 lbs.   (Eq. 1)\n\n\n\n The area surrounding the facility is relatively flat and unobstructed, indicating the endpoint distance table for rural topography should be used for all scenarios.\n\n The majority of TDI in the prepolymer is reacted to form a polyol-TDI polymer that is not regulated by the RM"

The quantity of TDI in all the product containers is determined by the following equation:\n\n\n\nQTDI = (10 wt %) x (24,000 lbs.) = 2400 lbs.\n\n\n\n The reactor is loaded with no more than 1100 lbs. of TDI during the prepolymer manufacture.  It is then reacted to form the 10 wt% prepolymer.\n\n The total capacity of the mixhead/lines is approximately 300 lbs. prepolymer.  However, the free TDI in the prepolymer (10 wt%) is regulated by the RMP rule.  The quantity of TDI in the mixhead/lines is determined by the following equation:\n\n\n\nQTDI = (10 wt %) x (300 lbs.) = 30 lbs.\n\n\n\n The cast foam product on the conveyor line is not covered by the RMP rule because the TDI is completely reacted to form the foam product.\n\n A worst case scenario analysis must be performed for the TDI storage tank release and not from the product storage containers.  Even though the TDI storage tank is diked and falls under mitigating circumstances of building confinement, this scenario has the potential to result in a greater endpoint distance than a release from the product containers.\n\n The quantity contained in the diked area surrounding the TDI storage tank is determined using equation 2 below:\n\nQdike =  (75.8pcf) x (632 ft2) x (2 ft) = 95,811 LB TDI      (Eq. 2)\n\n\n\nThe tanks hold a maximum capacity of 90,000 lbs. Therefore, Apool = Adike = 632 ft2.\n\n The linear interpolation method for estimating the worst-case release endpoint distance presented in this document overestimates the endpoint distance for the facility warehouse- the method does not consider the mitigating effect of the warehouse on the release.\n\n The temperature of the TDI in the tank trucks at delivery is typically less than 85A?F.  Therefore an interpolated 90A?F table was generated.\n\n The endpoint distance resulting from the rupture of the TDI bulk tank is determined using linear interpolation of values given in the endpoint distance lookup tables.
