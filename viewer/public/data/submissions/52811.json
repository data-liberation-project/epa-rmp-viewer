This is the first RMP for the facility and addresses processes containing reportable quantities of isopentane.\n\nThe North Brawley facility have processes that contain greater amounts of isopentane than the state and federal threshold planning quantities for flammable substances and is subject to the Program 3  requirements for the RMP.\n\nThis RMP meets the requirements of the federal Risk Management Program contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68 and requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program contained in Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations.  The quantities of isopentane handled at the facility also exceed the threshold quantities in the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management regulations in the 29 CFR 1910.119 and require hazard assessment under that program.\n\nNorth Brawley uses isopentane as the working fluid in the Rankin cycles for its Ormat Energy Converter Units.  The isopentane is delivered by qualified suppliers, stored in a secure area designed for seismic loads, pumped to the individual units, and circulated and recovered through a closed-loop system.  The plants have leak detection monitors and fire protection equipment installed through the area.  The RMP describes the current methods of delivery, storage, transfer, use and recovery of this flammable substance at the geothermal facility and includes a description of the vapor recovery and evacuation units installed at North Brawley.  The RMP includes additional safety measures to reduce the risk of damage from release of this flammable substance.  The RMP includes the specifications for the safe handling of both regulated substances and describes the training programs for employees, technicians, emergency responders, and contractors on sit"

It summarizes the inspection and preventive maintenance programs for the isopentane delivery, storage, and describes the incident investigations, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and pre-startup reviews for isopentane.\n\nSince the Brawley facility is new, there is no accident history.  However, comparable facilities owned by Ormat Nevada, Inc, the parent company of ORNI 18, LLC, can be used for accidental release comparison.  Heber 2 has operated for five years without a reportable accident in the isopentane systems, as defined by 40 CFR 68.42 and Section 2750.9 of the CalARP regulations. No release of isopentane at the Heber 2 have resulted in death, injury, or substantial damage to onsite facilities, nor have any releases of isopentane caused offsite evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nORNI 18, LLC has an Emergency Response Plan in place that provides for the notification of the public, evacuation of the site, and procedures to be undertaken in the event of an accidental release of isopentane.  \n\nORNI 18, LLC is submitting this RMP to the Department of Toxic Substances Control, the Administrating Agency for the CalARP program."
