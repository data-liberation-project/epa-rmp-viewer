In 2005 ownership and operation of the facility passed to Oxy. USA.  It is now operated by Occidental Permian Ltd. a subsidiary of Oxy. USA.  Occidental Permian Ltd\u00bfs. Salt Creek Gas Processing Facility is committed to operating and maintaining all of the processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release safeguards and programs, along with emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public and to protect the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release should occur, Salt Creek Gas Processing Facility personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\nThe Salt Creek Gas Processing Facility is located 22 miles west of Jayton, Texas.  It consist of one Program Level 1 process, which utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression and refrigeration) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  This plant could contain regulated flammables, but no regulated toxic inventories, in excess of the threshold quantities established in the regulation.  All transportation of regulated flammables into the facility is via pipelines and out of the facility via pipelines and trucks.  The plant is surrounded by unoccupied ranch land.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention History\nSa"

However, we do have an active PSM program that incorporates accidental release prevention.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nReview of the Salt Creek Gas Processing Facility incident records of the past five years; found that Salt Creek Gas Process Facility has not experienced an accidental release, with off-site impact, from a covered process resulting in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\nSlat Creek Gas Processing Facility maintains a written emergency action plan to control and contain an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Our plan considers all federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provides first aid and medical treatment for exposures.  It also contains plans for evacuation, accounting for personnel after the evacuation and notification of local emergency response agencies.  In the event of fire, explosion, or release of the regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP Plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n1.\tWe will continue to develop and utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing Salt Creek Gas Processing Facility incidents.\n2.\tWe will continue to develop and share management practices involving operations and maintenance activities between Occidental plants.\n3.\tWe will review our active process safety management program from time to time for appropriate improvements to the program.\n\nCertification\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specific endpoi"

Within the past five years the Salt Creek Gas Processing Facility process has had no accidental release that caused off-site impacts provided in 40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent off-site impacts from accidental releases.
