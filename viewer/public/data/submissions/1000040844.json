      "SummaryText": "GATX Corporation (GATX, formerly General American Transportation Corporation [GATC]) operates a railroad tank car service center located in Colton, CA for railcar maintenance, repair and painting services. Railroad cars, including tank cars, are delivered to this facility where they are cleaned and purged of their residual contents before maintenance and repairs are conducted on them. Specialized cleaning equipment includes an organic scrubber system and a flare system for venting cars containing ammonia or flammable gases. Since chlorine gas railcars are no longer brought into the facility, the scrubber system has been dismantled.  \n\nPer GATX operational policy, tank cars delivered to this facility may not contain residual chemicals above a certain quantity or else they are rejected and may not enter the facility to be cleaned.  This policy ensures that the quantity of hazardous materials stored on site remains within the quantities stated in the Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP).  \n\nSome of the chemicals  handled in the Colton facility during the railcar maintenance operations are considered hazardous and are regulated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under its Risk Management Program (RMP) codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program codified in  29 CFR Part 1910.119. These chemicals may also be regulated under the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program codified in California Health and Safety Code (HSC), Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Sections 25531-25543.3 and Chapter 4.5, Division 2 Title 19, California Code of Regulations (CCR).\n\nGATX initially reported that the quantity of these chemicals stored on-site would be the maximum residual quantity of the rail cars multiplied by the quantity of rail cars on site. Since many of these initial quantities exceeded threshold quantities set under the RMP and PSM regulations, GATX prepared the HMBP, RMP and PSM Plan"
