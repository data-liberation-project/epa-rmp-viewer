Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n    \n     The management and employees of Bureau Service Company are committed to the pervention\nof any accidental releases of anhydrous ammoniia.  If an accidential release should occur, the\nfacility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n    One of the primary activities at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Acess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 168,000 pounds, this would  include a rail tank cr holding 160,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the total contents of a \nstorage tank or tank car relesed as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantitiy released would be 168,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank or tank car as limited by design standards.\n\n    The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 2.5 miles.\n\n    The alternative release scenario based on the the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n\n    The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  The accidential release prevention program.\n\n    This facility complies with EPA's Accidentai Release Prevention Rule and all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions"

Five year accident history.\n\na.  There have been no accidental releses of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n    - have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n    - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property\n      damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n      The facility has:\n\n      - a  written emergency action plan,  in accordance with OSHA  standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;,\n\n     - provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information\n       as required under SARA Title III EPCRA;\n\n    - a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, \n       indluding pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.   Planned changes to improve safety.\n\na.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed\n     to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for\n    for emplementation at this time.\n\nb.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed\n    to access the maintenance of safe conditions.   in 2000 we plan to do extensive maintenance and\n    upgrade the facility to meet new state regulations for the handling and storage of anhydrous\n   ammonia."
