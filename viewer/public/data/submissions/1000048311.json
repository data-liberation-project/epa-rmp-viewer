Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nThe Company's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of The Company to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Company's emergency response plan involves the preparation of action plans and training of employees. The Company's refrigeration personnel are trained in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and WAC 296-62, Part P (HAZWOPER).\n\n\n\nAt The Company, anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n?    Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n\n?    Reduce the threat to our personnel\n\n?    Reduce the threat to the community\n\n\n\nB.    Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nMcDougall & Sons Inc. North Baker Flats Facility is a fruit packing and cold storage facility, located at 5905 Nelpar Drive East Wenatchee, WA.  The facility is located in Douglas County.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at The Company is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nThere are 29,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe Company uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  The Company has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nC.

Preventative maintenance program\n\n?    Written safety procedures and safety equipment\n\n?    Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\n\n\nThe Company also complies with: \n\n?    OSHA's and Washington State's process safety management rule.\n\n?    Applicable Washington State's safety regulations (WAC's 296-24 and 296-62).\n\n?    IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards for good work practices.\n\n?    Applicable local fire code for handling of hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to applicable codes and good practices at the time of installation.  Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles.  Engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety devices The Company utilizes include:\n\n?    Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n\n?    Suction trap hi-level float\n\n?    High discharge pressure shut down\n\n?    Low suction pressure shut down\n\n?    High discharge temperature shut down\n\n?    Oil pressure failure shut down\n\n?    High amperes shut down\n\n?    Automatic timer to prevent short cycling\n\n?    Oil filters plugged shut down\n\n?    250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\n?    150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\n?    Emergency ventilation\n\nOperating Procedures have been prepared by The Company to be used by employees performing operational functions.  The operating procedures are kept in the refrigeration office.  These procedures include: \n\n?    Pre-start up procedures\n\n?    Routine operations\n\n?    Maintenance\n\n?
