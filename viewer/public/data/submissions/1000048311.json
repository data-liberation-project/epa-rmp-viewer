It is the policy of The Company to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Company's emergency response plan involves the preparation of action plans and training of employees. The Company's refrigeration personnel are trained in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and WAC 296-62, Part P (HAZWOPER).\r\n\r\nAt The Company, anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\r\n\u00bf\tPrevent unnecessary human exposure\r\n\u00bf\tReduce the threat to our personnel\r\n\u00bf\tReduce the threat to the community\r\n\r\nB.\tFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nMcDougall & Sons Inc. North Baker Flats Facility is a fruit packing and cold storage facility, located at 5905 Nelpar Drive East Wenatchee, WA.  The facility is located in Douglas County.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance used at The Company is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nThere are 29,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThe Company uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  The Company has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nC.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe C"
