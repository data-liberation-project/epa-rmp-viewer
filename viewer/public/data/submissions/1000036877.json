The aerosol products stored and distributed primarily include the following trade names; Band-Aid Calamine Spray, Neosporin Anti-Fungal Spray, Neutrogena Sun Block Spray and Aveeno Sun Block Spray.  These products each use various amounts (or none) of the following propellants [Butane (#106-97-8), Isobutane (#75-28-5), Methyl Ether (#115-10-6), Pentane (#109-66-0)].  \r\n\r\nThe consumer aerosol products are typically in metal containers, less than 8 ounces in , including the product ingredients, as well as the propellants.  The individual containers are typically packaged in corrugated shippers.  The shippers are typically stacked on a pallet, on which there may be 1,000-2,000 individual containers.\r\n\r\nThe palletized loads are stored in steel pallet rack equipped with NFPA Scheme-A fire protection (heat baffling and in-rack sprinklers).  The Fontana facility warehouse is approximately 825,500sq-ft.  The facility warehouse is split into two buildings with a fire rated wall between the buildings.  In addition to the NFPA Scheme-A fire protection for the flammables and combustibles, there is ESFR fire protection throughout the general warehouse.  There are 24-hour security personnel and systems monitoring the facility for a potential event.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nOver the previous five years the Fontana Distribution Center has experienced no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case scenario was performed based on the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.   Based on the assumption that the entire conte"

The calculated distances do not extend beyond the site property line (no offsite receptors are impacted).  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe operator of the facility, Exel Logistics is subject to the California Unified Program Agencies (CUPA) annual submittal.  This submittal includes Emergency Response Plans and Procedures along with a Hazardous Materials Inventory Summary.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency and a potential release of flammable materials within the facility, Local Emergency Responders would be contacted through the use of 911, secondary contact would be made to the San Bernardino County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Division.   The third point of contact is the State of California, Governor\u00bfs Office of Emergency Services.\r\n\r\nEmployees of Excel Logistics and Johnson & Johnson Sales & Logistics are trained and instructed to evacuate through the nearest exit in the event of a release, fire or other evacuation signal.  Employees are not responsible for any action required to contain a release or to extinguish a fire. \r\n\r\nSafety/ Risk Assessment\r\n\r\nJohnson & Johnson, Sales & Logistics Company contracts Factory Mutual (FM) Global for Risk Assessment and underwriting.  At least annually, FM audits the facility with a team of engineers for the purpose of minimizing potential risk of catastrophic events."
