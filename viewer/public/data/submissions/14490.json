      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical Distribution and Warehousing Facilities\n\n1.     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Bayer, Polyurethane Division are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the storage and distribution processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with local Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.     The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemicals.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance,  toluene diisocyanate, is used as a reactant in the manufacturing of flexible polyurethane foams and other elastomers.  No manufacturing of any type or processing of toluene diisocyanate or any other chemical takes place at this facility.  The maximum inventory of  toluene diisocyanate at our facility is 300,000 lb.\n\n3.     The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.                                     To evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenario.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 1 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a 5"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.06 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0070 mg/L.\n\nNo alternative release scenario will be submitted for this toxic substance as none is required for Program 1 processes.\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity at this stationary source; thus a worst case release scenario for flammable substances as a class is not submitted.\n\n\n4.     The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAlthough 29 OSHA 1910.119 does not regulate our facility, we have taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements. All materials are store in containers that meet or exceed the Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements.  The closed containers are stored in accordance with the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) codes.  Containers are inspected for integrity when pulling the order for shipment and during the loading process.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBayer, Polyurethane Division maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is  HAZOP and What-If/Checklists .  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nBayer, Polyurethane Division has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nBayer, Polyurethane Division carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Bayer, Polyurethane Division to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Bayer, Polyure"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nBayer, Polyurethane Division conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions necessary to assure a safe operation are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 5 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nBayer, Polyurethane Division promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nBayer, Polyurethane Division truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOur company has  8 full-time contractors to conduct specialized operation, maintenance and construction activities.
