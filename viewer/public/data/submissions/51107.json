      "SummaryText": "The Chesapeake Energy Center is an electric utility generating plant which burns coal, oil, and natural gas to generate electricity.  One toxic substance is stored in reportable quantity, anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used by the facility in Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems in order to comply with nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission reductions required by U.S. EPA's Regional NOx SIP Call, as implemented through the Virginia's NOx Budget Trading Program Rule (9 VAC 5 Chapter 140, Rev D98) and EPA's Section 126 Rule.  The SCR process consists of injecting anhydrous ammonia into the boiler flue gas.  The gas then goes through a catalyst bed where the nitrogen oxides react to form nitrogen and water vapor.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario is defined by EPA to be a rupture of one ammonia storage tank, with its entire contents being released as a ten-minute gas release at ground level.  Based on the DEGADIS+ model as distributed through Trinity Consultants' BREEZE HAZ software for calculating the consequences of such a release at 7,250 lbs/min, ammonia could travel as much as 1.4 miles before being diluted to the toxic endpoint.  The population figure for the worst case scenario was reviewed in light of 2010 data from the U.S. Census Bureau and no change was needed.\r\n\r\nA more likely release scenario of ammonia would be a small hole or leak in the liquid or vapor space of a cylinder or its associated piping.  A number of such scenarios were examined, and in each case the toxic endpoint is 0.58 mile or less.  No people live within that distance of the release site, according to 2010 census data.\r\n\r\nThe company's prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  The facility has never had a reportable release of ammonia.  The facility maintains an emergency response plan for the control of petroleum releases.  This plan is used to notify regulatory a"
