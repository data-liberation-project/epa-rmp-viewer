This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in\naccident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation,operation and\nmaintenance of our gas processing facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent\nforeseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to\ncontrol and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Gas Plant and Cogen Facility located near 19590 7th Standard Rd in McKittrick , California compresses ,\ndistills, and dehydrates natural gas products from oil and gas wells at Aera Energy's Belridge production field\nand Produces steam and electricilty.. The marketable products produced at the Belridge gas plant are mixed\nbutane, natural gasoline, and propane. The Cogen facility  produces electricity and steam from gas turbines and stores Anhydrous Ammonia for use in Nox reduction of Turbine exhaust.  The Gasplant intermittently loads the LPG products through a loading rack into MC 331 tanker transports. The mixed butane and propane are flammable gases liquefied under pressure. Natural gasoline is a flammable liquid. Current regulated substances are propane,mixed butane and flammable mixture (natural gasoline). The Cogen facility's regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release incident at the Belridge Cogen Facility is a release of 50,000 lbs of anhydous ammonia in 10 minutes having release endpoint 4 miles . The alternative release scenario (ARS) is a transfer hose failure with a release rate of 69"

The gas plant worst case scenario (WCS) is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank of propane. The release amount would be 250,000 pounds, which is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.50 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nEach driver and vehicle are identified in the computer which has maximum fill levels for each vehicle, and drivers must be trained in facility procedures.Guard rails are provided to protect the loading rack from external impact. The truck driver attends the loading\nand is not permitted into the truck cab during loading. Emergency shutdown buttons are provided at the loading rack for use in an emergency, which closes the loading valves, pumps, and storage tanks. UV flame detection is also provided at the loading rack which will shut off loading pumps and valves if a flame is detected. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the facility. Because processes at\nthe Storage facility and Cogen are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management\nprogram (RMP) regulation , they are also subject to Cal/OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard.\nThis summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to\nimplement the accident prevention plan.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR RMP\nAera Belridge gas plant/Cogen has developed a management system in order to define all elements required by the process safety standard and risk management program. The management system defines for each program element the following:\n1. Purpose and scope of element\n2. Specific procedures\n3. Responsible and accountable personn"

Document locations for applicable documents\nThe management system is available for review at either facility.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nThe Belridge Gas Plant and Cogen encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as a part of the Belridge gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, Aera Belridge gas plant utilizes behavior based safety management\n(BBSM), an employee directed process to observe and review operations to assure safe behaviors are\nmaintained and unsafe behaviors are corrected with peer feedback and corrective action plans.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe Belridge gas plant/Cogen keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific personnel within the facilities are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the management system.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's).
