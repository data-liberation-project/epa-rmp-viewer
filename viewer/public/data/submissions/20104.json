      "SummaryText": "General Facility Overview: The Imerys Sandersville Calcine Plant consists of four calciners and associated equipment utilized to process kaolin clay into calcined kaolin products.  The facility utilizes natural gas as a primary fuel and liquefied propane as a secondary fuel.  Aqua ammonia (29.4% ammonia in water solution) is stored in liquid form and ismade down into a water solution for use as a pH control agent in the crude kaolin blunging operations.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:  It is the policy of Imerys Pigments, Inc. to comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur,  the Sandersville Fire Department and the Washington County EMA would be notified and requested to respond to the facility emergency.  The Sandersville Police Department would assist should road blocks and other measures be warranted.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Aqua Ammonia (29.4%):  The facility's worst case scenario is the catastrophic release of the entire liquid contents of the 15,000 gallon (112,264 lbs) aqua ammonia tank which contains approximately 30% ammonia.  The tank is limited to 80% capacity or approximately 90,000 pounds of aqua ammonia solution (approximately 27,000 pounds of ammonia).  RMP Comp estimates the distance to end point of less than a mile (0.9 miles).  This areas encompasses an area around the plant with an estimated population of 1,000 people.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Aqua Ammonia (29.4%):  The alternative scenario involves a hole in the side of the tank where an estimated 27,000 pounds of aqua ammonia solution is spilled (approximately 8,100 pounds of ammonia).  RMP Comp estimates the distance to end point at 0.2 miles.  This area encompasses approximately 200 people.\n\nFive year accident history:  This facility has not had an accident in the previous five years involving aqua ammonia which has caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in pla"
