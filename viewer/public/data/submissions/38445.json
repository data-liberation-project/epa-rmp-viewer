              "Description": "The Program 2 Prevention Program implemented addresses required elements of Accident Prevention Planning including: the compilation of and access to process safety information regarding aqueous ammonia and the technologies and equipment used to handle and use it; the conduct of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and implementation of recommendations during the design and implementation of the SCR system; development and implementation of operating and maintenance procedures for safe handling during startup, shutdown and normal, temporary and emergency operations; general training on the system and hazards of aqueous ammonia for employees and specific training for those involved in the operation and maintenance of the SCR process; a maintenance program with elements to review mechanical integrity, review changes and review safety after maintenance operations; conduct of periodic audits of the program; and continued implementation of accident and spill incident investigation programs at the Plant.   \n\nFirstEnergy Generating Corporation (FGCO) has compiled written process safety related information on aqueous ammonia, process technology and process equipment.  This information is maintained in the RMP program files and within the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manual documentation at the plant and includes: a listing of covered process equipment; a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS); process technology information; a study of the consequences of deviations; process equipment information; and emergency and first aid equipment and response procedures.\n  \nA formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been conducted employing the Checklist/What-If methodology to address consequences of the failure of the process equipment or any engineering/administrative controls to be employed.  \n\nIn conducting the PHA, process safety information, equipment specifications, drawings and other information on the SCR technology and process were utilized.  The PHA involved six major steps: Identification of associated risks; assessing of impact of equipment malfunctions; assessing human error opportunities; assessing existing safeguards; considering ways to detect/monitor releases and estimating maximum release quantities. \n\nAs a result, a number of recommendations were identified and addressed throughout the design and implementation phases of the SCR process.  These recommendations, in the form of action items, were documented and assigned responsibilities and deadlines to complete.  These recommendations address process design and control improvements including alarm set points and data communication, standard operating procedures for aqueous ammonia unloading, storage and transfer, including normal and emergency operating conditions, ensuring mechanical integrity of equipment including management.\n\nFirst Energy has developed written operating procedures for the system.  A written Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Manual was prepared by FGCOas design/build vendor.  FGCO also developed detailed operating instructions addressing normal and emergency operations for various elements of the process including: Aqueous Ammonia Railcar Unloading; Aqueous Ammonia Truck Unloading; Aqueous Ammonia Storage and Transfer to SCR Injection; and Aqueous Ammonia Containment Sump Management.  These procedures include specific information on safety features, alarm set points and responses, steady state conditions, shutdown procedures, long term outage instructions, maintenance requirements and emergency response.\n\nA formal training program has been instituted for training employees on the safe operation and potential hazards of aqueous ammonia storage, handling and SCR system injection, especially those involved in operation and maintenance of the covered process areas.  Plant personnel receive general awareness training on the SCR process, the requirement for an RMP program, and safe work practices they should follow to avoid hazards associated with the process.  Operations personnel working in the covered process areas receive in-depth instruction on operational aspects and procedures including normal and emergency startup, operation and shut down scenarios, safe operating limits, and emergency response requirements.  Maintenance personnel working in the covered process areas receive in-depth instruction on inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement of equipment. \n\nAt least every three years, employees responsible for operating or maintaining/repairing equipment or handling covered materials will receive refresher training as described above.  Whenever physical or chemistry changes to the covered process occurs, the hazard review will be revisited and affected employees will be made aware of the changes and re-trained where appropriate.\n\nIt is the policy of FGCO to assure the safe operation of equipment used in the ammonia storage and transfer process at the Bruce Mansfield Plant.  This will be accomplished in part through a system of periodic inspections and/or tests to monitor and assess the condition of designated equipment.  Corrective actions will be initiated as necessary. \n\nIt is also the policy of FGCO to safely operate a facility designed and built according to good engineering practices that incorporate methods or principles in accordance with applicable industry standards.  Generally accepted industry standards including ASME Code for Pressure Piping, B31.3 and ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII have been employed in the design of the SCR system.  The facility will be operated according to specific procedures that ensure that replacement equipment is compatible with process materials and operating conditions.\n\nIn addition to initial Process Hazard Analyses, programs for mechanical integrity, managing changes, and employee training, pre-start up safety reviews ensure and confirm that all elements of accident prevention are addressed during initial start-up and whenever significant process or equipment changes have occurred.  This program includes procedures for such reviews.\n\nFGCO has established guidelines and procedures for auditing RMP covered process areas as required by the RMP Rule.  Compliance audits will be performed at least once every three years based on the date the RMP program is complete and the process is first started.\n\nCompliance Audits will be performed by a team that includes at least one person knowledgeable in the process and at least one person knowledgeable in the RMP Rule requirements.  The remainder of the team may include representatives from operations, maintenance, engineering, quality, safety and environmental organizations familiar with the process and requirements and trained in all elements of the RMP Plan.\n\nFGCO has instituted an Incident Investigation Procedure designed to assure that accidents and incidents occurring within RMP-covered areas involving the catastrophic release of hazardous substances are properly investigated and corrective actions are developed and implemented.  The goal of this program is to reduce the potential or likelihood that incidents recur and to ensure that continuous improvement of the process and procedures reduces accidents, incidents or releases of hazardous substances.  \n\nThis procedure is intended to apply to RMP-covered process areas and substances but adopts existing OSHA Incident Investigation and EPA Facility Response Plan (FRP) procedures for incident investigation and release reporting applicable throughout the Bruce Mansfield facility.  This procedure addresses accidents, incidents and/or releases that could impact the nearby public and environment in addition to employees and contractors working in the covered process areas at the plant.",

      "SummaryText": "FirstEnergy Generation Corporation (FGCO) operates a 2,340 MW (NDC) coal-fired electrical generating plant, known as the Bruce Mansfield Plant, in Shippingport, PA.  Federal and Pennsylvania environmental regulations require coal-burning utilities to reduce emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (Nox).  Part of the Nox control and reduction strategy at the Bruce Mansfield Plant is the installation of Selected Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology.  SCR reduces Nox emissions by reacting flue gas containing Nox  with ammonia to form nitrogen and water.  The SCR system at the Bruce Mansfield Plant uses aqueous ammonia mixed with air injected into flue gas after the economizer in Units 1, 2 and 3.  The system will operate on Units 1 and 2 during the ozone season of May 1 through September 30 beginning in 2003. It is anticipated that the system will operate during the ozone season each year thereafter. The Unit 3 system is forecasted to commence operation in 2004.\n\nEPA's RMP threshold for coverage under the rule is any process with aqueous ammonia of 20% concentration in quantities over 20,000 pounds. OSHA's PSM threshold for coverage is any process with aqueous ammonia of 44% concentration in quantities over 15,000 pounds.  The covered process as described in this RMP exceeds EPA RMP thresholds but not the OSHA PSM concentration threshold.  Therefore, only RMP requirements apply at this time.\n\nThe covered process includes all areas in the SCR system where aqueous ammonia exists in concentrations above the RMP threshold of 20%.  This includes the railcar unloading operations, storage tanks and transfer lines up to the point of vaporization and injection, where the concentration falls below the concentration threshold as it is atomized into a gaseous spray (approximately 3% concentration by volume).  Covered activities related to this process include the use, operation, repair, replacement and maintenance of equipment in the process.  All personnel involved in these activities are p"

      "SummaryText": "roperly trained in normal and emergency or upset operations.\n\nAs defined by the rule, the worst case release is the failure of one of the storage tanks inside the storage tank containment area.  The spill of 29% aqueous ammonia would flow along the sloped floor towards a centerline sump.  The sump has pre-cast concrete covers with 3 inch diameter holes to allow drainage but restrict evaporation.  According to engineering calculations, a spill this large would drain through the covers in about 8.5 minutes.  Employing this passive mitigation results in a worst-case scenario with a distance to endpoint that does not impact public or environmental receptors offsite based on analytical methods provided by EPA.\n\nSeveral alternate case scenarios, which may be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario described above, were examined to assess their potential to impact public receptors as well.  The first scenario examined was that of a tank car spill resulting from the failure of a four inch diameter line at the bottom of the car allowing discharge of the entire railcar into the containment sump below.  The sumps in the railcar unloading area are also equipped with pre-cast concrete covers that allow drainage but restrict evaporation.  Based on similar calculations for drainage through the three inch diameter holes in the pre-cast covers, the railcar would nearly instantly drain into the sump and evaporation would be negligible.\n\nAnother scenario examined was that of a pipe failure downstream of the railcar unloading pumps while the pumps were running, allowing aqueous ammonia to discharge onto the ground for about 10 minutes until the condition is identified and the pumps shut down.  Utilizing analytical methods provided by EPA results in a distance to endpoint that does not impact public or environmental receptors offsite.  Therefore neither of these alternate case scenarios has the potential to impact public receptors.\n\nAs this is a new process, there have been no"
