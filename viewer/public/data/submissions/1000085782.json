      "SummaryText": "OEC) consists of two levels of power extraction, Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2). The Iso Pentane in each of these levels are completely isolated from one another and each circulate in a closed loop. The turbine in each of these loops is directly coupled to a common generator. Each level has similar components with the exception that that the L2 cycle does not have a recuperator as does the L1 cycle. For each cycle the power extraction starts in heat exchangers (preheaters and vaporizers) which absorb heat from the geothermal brine in order to boil and convert the iso pentane into its vapor phase. The vaporized iso pentane is then directed to turbines specially designed to convert thermal energy in the vaporized iso pentane to rotational mechanical energy. The turbines which are directly coupled to the same generator, in turn, rotate the generator leading to the generation of electrical power. Iso pentane from the turbine is directed through a recuperator and then air-cooled condenser in the L1 cycle and directly to the air-cooled condenser in L2.  The condensers then complete the condensing of iso pentane back to its liquid phase. From the condensers iso pentane falls to the suction of the feed pumps which pressurize the iso pentane and direct the iso pentane through the regenerators, a non-contact heat exchange process, to absorb heat from the iso pentane moving from the turbine outlet to the condensers and to the preheater in the L1 cycle. In the L2 cycle iso pentane goes directly from the feed pumps to its preheater to start the cycle over again.\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\r\n\r\n  The Worst-Case Release Scenario evaluated was that of a ruptured iso pentane tank leading to a BLEVE condition using 166,637 pounds of iso pentane.

This leading to spill lasting 10 minutes and subsequently a pool fire starting before any mitigating efforts can take effect.  Using RMP*Comp to perform the calculations it is estimated that the initial iso pentane flow rate will be 2,320 pounds per minute leading to a heat radiation endpoint of 5 kw/square meter at 0.2 miles (0.4 kilometers) from the fire.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\n  The accidental release program developed for the Lightning Dock Geothermal Facility is a formal program implemented to satisfy the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Admiration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) and the United States Environment Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements.

The facility is committed to being a responsible member of the nearby communities. Site policy dictates that the SL3 Facility continuously identify methods to identify and reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safe technologies and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in policy and safety procedures at the facility which are available to all employees who are trained to these policies and safety procedures.\r\n\r\n Description of the Soda Lake 3 Unit Geothermal Facility and the Regulated Substance Used.\r\n\r\n  The facility uses heat from geothermal brine at approximately 327 degrees Fahrenheit to heat, through a non-contact heat exchange process, a single iso pentane process that converts the geothermal heat to electric power for sale to the University of Utah through a wheeling agreement with the local utility (NV Energy) to meet their renewable electric power commitments. The iso pentane used in the closed loop (recirculated/recycled) power generation process is the only regulated substance at the site. The facility can have on site up to 36,000 gallons of iso pentane being used in the process or being stored. It is expected that, due to fugitive emission losses, no more than one truck of approximately 4,200 gallons of makeup iso pentane will be required per year and, in fact, continuous monitoring of leakages and proper maintenance will in all eventuality reduce fugitive emission losses and the need to replenish significantly. When iso pentane is delivered to the site it will be off loaded at a designated iso pentane storage area and under well qualified and approved safe operating procedures.\r\n  The power generation process ("

OSHA and NAC definitions of these conditions are as follows:\r\n\u00bf\tIncident: An unplanned, undesired event that adversely affects completion of a task.\r\n\u00bf\tCatastrophic Release: An uncontrolled emission, fire or explosion involving one or more highly hazardous substances or explosives that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of the employees, the public health or the environment.  The term includes events that occur within a building or other structure that contains the substance or explosive.\r\n\u00bf\tAccident: An undesired event that results in personal injury or property damage.\r\n\u00bf\tNear Miss: An incident where no property was damaged and no personal injury sustained, but where, given a sl"
