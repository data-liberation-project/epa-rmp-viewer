Facility Policy: The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any\n\naccidental releases of anhydrous and aqua ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular\n\ninspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous and aqua ammonia. Should\n\nan accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency\n\nplanning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to\n\npeople and the environment. An active PSM program is established and maintained.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\n\nand the production, storage and handling of aqua ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and\n\nused in processing mixed fertilizers and aqua ammonia while the aqua ammonia is produced, stored and then\n\ndistributed to farmers for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient. The Program Level for\n\nboth the anhydrous storage and the aqua production processes were upgraded to a Level 3 to further comply\n\nwith the RMP regulations. Previous Level 2 programs were used because of the interpolation of the use of\n\nammonia in the batch mixing facility (OSHA exemption). A portable pipe reactor is also operated on site on\n\noccasion. This unit is subject to OSHA-PSM and all documentation for that unit is generated and maintained\n\nby the contractor. Ouachita Fertilizer reviews and monitors the contractors PSM documentations and\n\nrecords.\n\n\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-\n\ncase scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as\n\nrequested by EPA.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Program: This facility complies with the various rules and regulatio"

Training is provided on safe ammonia operations for\n\nemployees. An active Process Safety Management program is in effect and employees are engaged in\n\nkeeping the program viable. The mechanical integrity of all of the covered processes is integrated into a\n\ncomprehensive ongoing inspection, testing and repair/replacement program and is championed by the\n\nemployees and supported by the management.\n\n\n\n5. Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous or aqua ammonia for the\n\ncovered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA\n\nStandards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120. The Emergency Plan for this facility includes specific instructions for\n\nemployees regarding the response procedures to an emergency and are directed to act as Limited First\n\nResponders. Response actions will differ by product depending on the qualifications of the personnel and the\n\nseverity of the release. Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to the\n\nstate emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as\n\nrequired by SARA Title III of EPCRA.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic\n\ninspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. The\n\nimplementation of an active PSM program will reinforce all of the installed safety policies. There are no\n\nadditional specific anhydrous or aqua ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
