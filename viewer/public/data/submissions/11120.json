Epichlorohydrin is the only RMP regulated substance handled in the Shipping/Loading area.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) SCENARIOS\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed on the potential worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS) involving toxic and flammable substances at the Norco Chemical Plant - West Site.  The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions, nor allow credit for all mitigations in-place.  On the other hand, the ARS is a more realistic scenario which takes into account actual operating conditions and applicable mitigations.\n\nThe following are brief summaries of the Worst-case and Alternate Release scenarios at the Norco Chemical Plant -  West Site, including information on mitigation control measures which can reduce potential offsite impact.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the ABS Group, Inc. RMPlanner 2.0 software tool.  This tool is based on the 1996 EPA OCA Guidance Tables.  Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, BUREAU OF THE CENSUS Landview .

These measures include:\n\n- Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs \n- A perimeter chlorine detection system\n- Critical instrument systems with audible and visual alarms\n- Automatic isolation valves\n- An emergency containment system \n- Routine surveillance by trained operators\n- Normal operating limits of storage vessel maintained at 10-20% of capacity. \n\n2. Alternative Toxic Release Scenario - Chlorine\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a 484 lb. release from 1/8 gasket leak on a 6 pipeline orbit valve.

Operator intervention is assumed to initiate emergency notification procedures and apply water from nearby firewater monitors.  Operations personnel would respond to close pipeline block valves to isolate the leak.  The Emergency Response Team (ERT) would respond to suppress any fire or vapors and apply a clamp to stop release.

Many of the documents, including MSDS' are electronically available to all NCP employees and Contractors.   The Process Safety Management policy also includes a summary table to assist employees in locating process safety information documents and drawings.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHAs)\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant maintains a comprehensive Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) program to identify and control hazards associated with its processes.  These include processes covered under one or a combination of: (1) RMP Program 3, (2) OSHA PSM, and (3) Shell internal criteria.  NCP uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology to conduct process unit PHAs.  PHA team members must include experienced employees with operating, maintenance, and engineering backgrounds who are familiar with the affected process.  The PHA team is chartered to identify the safety hazards in the process, evaluate the adequacy of  existing safeguards in-place, determine the risk of the event occurring, and recommend additional accident prevention mitigations when the team believes such measures are necessary to reduce event risk.  All safety related PHA findings are risk ranked to ensure mitigation measures receive timely attention based on their risk priority.  All PHA findings are forwarded to local Management for review and resolution.  Safety related mitigations approved by Management begin immediately after Management review, starting with the highest risk scenarios.   When a final mitigation can not be implemented with"

PHA mitigations are tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  Process unit PHA's are revalidated every 5 years for the life of the process.  Written PHA reports are also retained for the life of the process.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nNorco Chemical Plant operating departments maintain written procedures to address a variety of operating modes such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide a reference to experience operators, as well as serve as a training tool for new operators.  Each PSM covered operating department must annually certify their procedures as current and accurate.  The management of change process is also used to ensure operating procedures are updated as necessary to reflect changes in the process unit.  Operating procedures are accessible to all NCP employees either electronically or in hard copy.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant implements a comprehensive training program for all operating, maintenance, and technical personnel.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their process.  In addition to classroom training, on-the-job training is accomplished by working with experienced operating personnel.  Along with routine operating practices, the training places a significant emphasis on unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions (including shutdown).  Employees involved in operating a process must be qualified to perform the job on that process.  Operators must re-qualify on their jobs every three (3) years and work a predesignated number of hours by job to maintain qualification."

The training program complements the written operating procedures to ensure operating employees are properly qualified for their job.  All training is documented and managed by the NCP Training Department.\n\nContractors \n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant routinely uses contractors to supplement its maintenance and technical workforce, particularly during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Since contractors may work on or near process equipment, NCP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors have the proper knowledge, skills, and training to perform their work in a safe manner prior to working on-site.  Contractor safety programs and performance are primary factors influencing the Contractor selection process.  Contractors are routinely monitored by a Contract Coordinator to ensure compliance with regulatory and Shell requirements.  Contractor safety performance is also part of NCP weekly safety statistics communications to employees and contractors. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features such as P&ID and other process drawings, operating and/or maintenance procedures, training and equipment are up to date and appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in-service.  This review provides an additional check to ensure construction is in accordance with design specifications, that all supporting systems are operationally ready, and personnel are appropriately trained on the modification.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain the integrity of pressur"

This system requires that changes to equipment hardware, chemicals, operating variables (including critical process operating conditions), procedures, operating staff and any other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all personnel affected by a change must be provided the necessary notification and training. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant promptly investigates incidents resulting in, or could have reasonably resulted in fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to NCP Management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all potentially affected employees and contractors.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant maintains a comprehensive audit program to ensure accident prevention policies and procedures are in place and functioning"

Compliance audits consist of: (1)  OSHA PSM compliance audits conducted every three years at each NCP site, (2) external compliance audits by Shell's Corporate Office on a three year cycle, and (3) internal management system audits conducted annually to evaluate the accident prevention system for each unit.  Employees ranging from hourly, engineering and technical, and management personnel participate as audit team members in the internal audit process.  The audit team(s) develop findings that are forwarded to NCP Management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and audit findings are retained for six (6) years.\n\nSite-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant's accident prevention program is applied to the West Site due to potential hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  This program is intended to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human error.  The West Site has various safety features to: (1) detect,  (2) contain and control, and (3) mitigate the consequences of a release that include:\n\n1. Release detection\n- Process alarms\n- Operator surveillance\n- Portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment \n- Perimeter chlorine detection system\n\n2. Release containment and control\n- Relief systems designed to prevent equipment overpressurization (i.e. relief valves and flare)\n- Dikes to contain liquid releases\n- Redundant equipment (i.e. back-up firewater pump)\n- Automatic control valves to allow rapid isolation of the process\n- Chlorine emergency containment system\n\n3.   Release Mitigation  \n- Area firewater monitors\n- Mobile emergency response equipment\n- Trained emergency response personnel\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOver the last five (5) years, there have been no releases of RMP regulated substances from the NCP-West Site that have resul"
