The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \n\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Huckabay Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Huckabay Gas Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u0092s findings are tracked until they are complete.

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  Employees receive basic training on the operating procedures when they are first assigned to the plant and refresher training to ensure that their skill and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nContractors:  Huckabay Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Huckabay Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

      "SummaryText": "te written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Huckabay Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Huckabay Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\nOperating Procedures:  Huckabay Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operati"

Based on the analysis using the EPA\u0092s RMP*Comp \u0099 calculations, the calculated endpoint of the one pound over pressure from a vapor cloud explosion is approximately 0.4 miles for the vessel.  2010 Census Data provided through the EPA MARPLOT Version 5.1.1 identified that approximately 0 people and 0 residences were within the impact area.  Based on a 2023 ESRI aerial review, the property surrounding the Huckabay Plant within a 0.4-mile radius is mostly agriculture except for two public receptors.  The following provides a summary of the worst case analysis performed.  \n\nNGL - Vapor Cloud Explosion: 0.4 miles\n\nIn addition to the worst case analysis, the following alternative case analysis summarized below was performed.  The alternative release scenario is characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite consequences.  As a conservative estimate, it is assumed the condensate vapor would have a similar makeup as the NGLs produced.  The estimated release time for this analysis is 10 minutes and EPA\u0092s RMP*Comp \u0099 was used to calculate the estimated impact distance.\n\nCondensate (Un-stabilized) - Vapor Cloud Explosion caused by the ignition of vapors created during a release from the 30,000-gallon condensate vessel due to a four-inch puncture: 0.2 miles\n\nThese scenarios would account for any potential releases from process piping including flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals.  Any releases from vessels including drains, bleeds, cracks, seal failures, plug failures, overfilling, over-pressurization, and venting would also be accounted for in these scenarios.
