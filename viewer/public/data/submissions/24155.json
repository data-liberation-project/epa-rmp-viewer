Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Great Lakes Chemical Newport Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We are also completely coordinated with Newport/Cocke County Emergency Management, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass organic chemical synthesis.  We have six regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include bromine, hydrazine, phosphorous oxychloride [phosphoryl chloride], phosphorous trichloride [Phosphorous trichloride], propylene oxide [oxirane, methyl-], and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous). The regulated substances at our facility are used for chemical synthesis.  \n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the DBB process.

The scenario involves the release of 10 lb. of bromine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1-cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 11.53 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include a sprinkler system, water blanket and neutralization.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0065 mg/L of bromine is 0.10 mile.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for hydrazine involves a release from the hydrazine storage area in the PE-68 and the DBB processes.  The scenario involves the release of 169 lb. of hydrazine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1-cm, from which evaporation takes place.

Several evacuations were issued.  On-site, there were thirteen injuries.  There was some property damage on-site.\n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nGreat Lakes Chemical Newport Plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Included are specific procedures for RMP regulated chemicals.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe Cocke County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) director has been issued a copy of the Contingency Plan and been reviewed on the key elements.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. The Great Lakes Chemical Newport Plant plans to continuously improve and update operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment to original specifications or design codes and develop and implement safety improvement capital projects.  These are some of the major steps we have taken to improve safety at our facility:  \n\nAn additional water monitor (cannon) was installed before startup of the DBB process in Building 21 This addition was determined during a table top drill performed before the startup of the process and affords improved control of bromine vapor in the event of a release.\n\nA water \"blanket\" is maintained in the secondary concrete dikes, which contain the bromine storage tanks. A bromine release will sink through the water layer and evaporation will be greatly minimized.\n\nThese changes have been implemented by 12/31/98.\n\nAs part of planning for any additional RMP regulated chemicals that are not currently stored at the Newport Plant, Great Lakes Chemical Corporation will conducted detailed examination of new processes to include passive mitigation structures and measures to minimize or stop releases. \n\n8.
