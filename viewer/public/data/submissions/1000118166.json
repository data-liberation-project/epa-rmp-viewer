      "SummaryText": "1. Accident Release Prevention and Response Policies\nTwin Eagle Terminals and Logistics (TETL) owns and operates the Twin Eagle rail facility (facility) in Howard County, Colorado.\nThe facility is designed to transfer butane from railcars to trucks for delivery to end markets.\nTETL has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by efforts in accident\nprevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and\nmaintenance of TETL facilities. TETL policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated\nsubstances. However, if a release does occur, trained TETL personnel plan to evaluate the situation, take actions within the\ncapabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n1.1\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nButanes are unloaded from railcars into trucks with an operating capacity of approximately 3,708,400 gallons of flammable chemicals. The\nrailcars and connected pipelines are considered a single process that has two or more connected vessels of the same\nregulated substance that could be involved in a potential release at the facility. Regulated flammable substances (listed in the\n40 CFR \u00a768.130) used at the facility are i-Butane, n-Butane, i-Pentane, n-Pentane, 1-Butene, Propane, and Ethane. Since there are different flammable\nsubstances in a single process, this is defined as a flammable mixture. The RMP rule only applies to flammable mixtures if the\namount of a regulated substance in the mixture is greater than one percent (1%) and the mixture as a whole meets the\nNational Fire Protection Association\u0092 s 4 rating (NFPA-4) requirements of \u0093materials that vaporize quickly or completely when\nsubjected to normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, are easily dispersed in the air, and burn easily\u0094. Typically, this\ndegree includes materials that will spontaneously ignite wh"

The covered process for the mixture of\nflammable substances is calculated for a worst-case scenario that involves the flammable mixture substances above the\nthreshold quantities, greater than 10,000 pounds.\nToxics were not modeled as part of this analysis because the only regulated substances present are i-Butane, n-Butane, i-Pentane, n-Pentane, 1-Butene, Propane, and Ethane, which are not classified as toxic substances.\n1.2\tGeneral Accident Release Program 3 Prevention Program\n1.2.1\tEmployee Participation\nTETL encourages employees to participate in areas of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n\u0095\tUpdating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n\u0095\tPerforming necessary calculations for Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\u0095\tMaintaining good engineering practices\n\u0095\tParticipating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team\nEmployees have access to information about the accident prevention program.\n1.2.2\tProcess Safety Information\nTETL has developed and implemented numerous technical documents to support the safe operation of the facility processes.\nThese technical documents address:\n\u0095\tChemical properties and associated hazards\n\u0095\tNecessary block flow diagrams of the process\n\u0095\tMaximum chemical substance inventories\n\u0095\tUpper and lower limits of fixed and rotating process equipment\n\u0095\tEquipment design basis and configuration information\n\u0095\tAdequate information to support good engineering practices\nThe information referenced above is included in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Standard Operating Procedures (SOP),\nand 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan (EAP) provided by TETL.\nChemical-specific information, including hazard and emergency respons"

The facility maintains the\nprocess within these limits by using process equipment and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective\ninstrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents with information about the design and construction of the process\nequipment including materials of construction, design pressures, temperature, and electrical ratings. The design and\nconstruction information of the process equipment, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provide a\nbasis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes. Process\nsafety information must be readily accessible to workers and contractors.\n1.2.3\tProcess Hazard Analysis\nTETL has a comprehensive program, including a team of personnel, to identify and manage hazards associated with the RMP covered process. This program systematically examines potential hazards and puts equipment in place to manage hazards.\nThe team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations for the management of identified potential hazards. The team's\nfindings are forwarded to TETL management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's\nfindings are tracked until completion. The ultimate resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nThe facility continuously updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These continuous reviews are conducted\nregularly for at least five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

Procedures are continuously reviewed and annually certified by management for\ncompleteness and accuracy. Operating procedures are revised, as necessary, by employee suggestions, compliance audits,\nPHAs, good engineering practice, and pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR), to maintain completeness and accuracy. Revisions\nare implemented through TETL management.\nProcess operating procedures are readily available for personnel to use, as necessary, to safely perform their job tasks and\nmaintain the process unit operations within the defined limits.\n1.2.5\tTraining\nTETL has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating covered processes at the\nfacility. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After\ncompleting this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A\nperformance review must be concluded during this training interval. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to\nperform the duties and tasks safely on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, operators continuously\nreceive subsequent training on the operating procedures to refresh their skills and knowledge to an acceptable level.

This review provides an additional check that construction is in compliance with the design\nspecifications and that supporting systems are ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as\nquality assurance verification that the prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n1.2.8\tMechanical Integrity\nTETL has established practices and procedures for the secure operation of fixed, rotating, and emergency shutdown\nequipment. The basic aspects of the program include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u0095\tConducting training\n\u0095\tDeveloping written procedures\n\u0095\tPerforming examinations and tests\n\u0095\tCorrecting identified deficiencies\n\u0095\tApplying quality assurance measures\nThese activities form a sys"

Maintenance personnel receive training on:\n\u0095\tOverview of the process\n\u0095\tSafety and health hazards\n\u0095\tApplicable maintenance procedures\n\u0095\tEmergency response plan\n\u0095\tApplicable secure work practices to help them to perform their jobs in a secure manner\nWritten procedures support consistent work performance and serve as a basis for training. Examinations and tests are\nperformed to help verify that equipment functions as intended, and that equipment is operating within acceptable limits. If a\ndeficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate welfare concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the\nequipment back into service. The management team reviews the status of the equipment and determines what further action is\nnecessary.\nAn integral part of the integrity program is quality assurance. TETL incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment\npurchases and repairs. This helps to determine that new equipment is applicable for its intended use and that the proper\nmaterials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n1.2.9\tSafe Work Practices\nTETL has standing safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, EPA, industrial standards, and good engineering practices in\nplace to help provide employee, public, and process safety.\n1.2.10\tManagement of Change\nTETL has a comprehensive system to manage changes to facility processes. This system requires that changes to items such\nas process equipment, chemicals, technology, and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being\nimplemented. Each proposed change must be reviewed to:\n\u0095\tDetermine that adequate equipment is in place to manage new hazards\n\u0095\tVerify that existing equipment has not been compromised by the proposed change\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to\nincorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n1.2.11\tInciden"

      "SummaryText": "t Investigation\nTETL promptly investigates each incident related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a\nfire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts\nand develop recommendations to prevent future occurrences and forward these results to facility management for resolution.\nCorrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u0092s findings and recommendations are tracked until they are\nconcluded. The ultimate resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for\nat least five years.\n1.2.12\tCompliance Audits\nAccording to 40 CFR \u00a768.79(a), TETL is required to conduct an audit every 3 years of the covered procedure to assess\ncompliance with the requirements of the prevention program. The audit must involve at least one individual who is\nknowledgeable about the process. Good engineering practices are conducted by TETL employees and management, or a\nqualified third-party, if appropriate. This audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.\nCorrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are concluded. The ultimate resolution\nof each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n1.2.13\tChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nTETL's accidental release prevention and response policies are applied to the entire RMP-covered process through universal\nprevention activities, including but not limited to: elimination of sources of ignition, drains for liquid releases, and avoidance of\ncongested areas. Collectively, these prevention program activities help avoid potential accident scenarios that could be caused\nby equipment failures and human errors.\n1.2.14\tSpecialized Safety Features\nFacility-specific detection and equipment (safety features) are deployed throughout the facility to:\n\u0095\tContain/monitor a re"
