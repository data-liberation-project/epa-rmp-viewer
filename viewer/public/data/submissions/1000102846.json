      "SummaryText": "Phillips 66 - East St Louis Terminal is a refined petroleum product distributor.  The East St Louis Terminal is an on-shore, light products, bulk petroleum storage facility used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail or commercial end-users.  The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, transmix, diesel fuel, jet fuel, butane, propane, and various other petroleum-based additives. \n\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the Dehydrator Regeneration (Butane) and Propane Truck Loading Process and Butane Blending Process at the Terminal (herein also referred to as \"the Facility\").  This document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and includes by reference the Process Safety Management Program elements in 29 CFR Part 1910.119. The process is classified as Program Level 3 under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe primary function of the Facility is to act as a refined petroleum storage and distribution facility.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling Butane and Propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Phillips 66 - East St Louis Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which LPG are handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Facility.\n\nIn addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent or minimize possible releases of Butane and Propan"

      "SummaryText": "e, if a release does occur, an emergency response plan is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the local fire department, St. Clair County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and Illinois Division of Emergency Services to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nTHE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED AT THE FACILITY:\nThe RMP regulated substance handled at the distribution facility is Butane and Propane.  The maximum amount of Butane that can be stored at this facility is approximately 660,000 pounds. The maximum amount of Propane that can be stored at this facility is approximately 160,000 pounds.\n\nPropane is pumped from eight onsite DOT covered storage tanks to the truck loading dock. Through two lines, the propane passes through a filter and is loaded to a truck via hose connection. \n\nButane is pumped from a Butane Tank, sent through a heater, and passes through two dehydrator towers for purpose of regeneration. The Butane is cooled and sent to a Surge Tank to separate the water before being recycled back to the dehydration process.\n\nThe Butane blending system consists of a single offload station, two butane vessels (60,000 gallons), butane supply pump and injection skid to blend butane prior to the facility gasoline truck rack.  Additional ancillary sampling system (gasoline and ethanol) is used to determine blending rate.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nThe objectives of this hazard assessment are twofold: (1) satisfy the requirements of the RMP regulation and (2) provide Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) information that will help local emergency planning officials improve community emergency response in the event of an accidental release at the site. Due to the nature of covered substances (propane, butane), OCA focused on potential releases of flammable materials. In modeling flammable materials, the stationary source is required to present distances to endpoints resulting from any of the following: \n\u0095\tExplosion: Overpressure"

The facility has modeled alternative release scenarios (ARSs) to show release scenarios that may have a more realistic chance of occurrence. Even the ARSs are rare events. The details of the process release conditions assumed for the hazard scenarios and assumptions made are provided in the Worst and Alternative Case Release Scenarios sections of the 2022 RMP Resubmission. \nSince no changes in inventory of the regulated substance or the operating conditions of the covered process have occurred in the last 5 years, the facility revalidated the Worst-Case and Alternate Scenarios that were modeled for the 2017 submission. \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nPhillips 66's accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by the facility's regulated substance to employees, contractors, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68 and the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard 29CFR 1910.119. Due to that fact, the accident prevention and risk management plan is organized to be consistent with the PSM regulation requirements. The following accident prevention programs are in place at the Phillips 66 Mount Vernon Terminal: \n1.\tEmployee Participation, \n2.\tProcess Safety Information, \n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA), \n4.\tStandard Operating Procedures,\n5.\tOperator Training, \n6.\tContractors, \n7.\tPre-startup Safety Review, \n8.\tMechanical Integrity,\n9.\tHazardous Work Authorization (Hot Work, etc.), \n10.\tManagement of Change,\n11.\tIncident Investigation, \n12.\tEm"

The Facility has a written Emergency Response Program in the event of an accidental release which includes emergency health care and steps to inform the public.  A plan is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, medical emergency, etc., and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. \nAs a responsible owner operator of a stationary source, in compliance with 68.210(b), the terminal will hold a public meeting to provide information required under \u00a768.42(b), no later than 90 days after any RMP reportable accident at the stationary source with any known offsite impact specified in \u00a768.42(a) (i.e., known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage). The terminal also holds annual meeting and communication with the county LEPC\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nThe Facility is constantly re-evaluating the current safety systems through the use of prevention programs such as Management of Change and the Process Hazard Analysis program. As a result of these programs, and other safety and risk reduction initiatives, improvements to the safety of the workers and the surrounding community continue to occur. All hazardous consequence mitigation recommendations from PHAs relating to safety and environment are prioritized by a risk matrix designed to address highest risk scenarios first.  \nSince the last RMP submission one PHAs revalidation have been conducted t"
