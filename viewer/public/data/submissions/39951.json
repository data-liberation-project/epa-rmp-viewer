      "SummaryText": "1.    The Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of Oldham Bros. Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and  training of all persons that work with the materials.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment\n2.    Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers for ammonia and home owners for propane.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  While the propane is sold to homeowners for heating fuel.  The maximum quantity stored would be 170,000 pounds of ammonia in the facility?s 2 ammonia tanks and 42,300 pounds of propane in the facilities 2 propane tanks.  The capacities of each ammonia tank is, 85,000 lbs. And the size of the propane tanks are 7000 gal and 6000 gal.\n3.    The ammonias worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the ammonia storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 85,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .98 miles.\n\nThe ammonia?s alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer house, with 12000 pounds over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .56 miles.\n\nThe propane worst-case release scenario would be the release of 42300 pounds at 1psi in a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .4 miles.\n\nThe propane alternative-case release scenario is a"

      "SummaryText": "ssumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, with 5400 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is.2 miles.\n4.    The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the regulations to the \nHandling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.   \n5.    The five year Accident History:\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries , or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n6.    The Emergency Response program:  The facility has a written emergency action    \nPlan in accordance with OSHA standard 209 CFR 1910.328 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process\n            at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of \n            safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous \n            ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
