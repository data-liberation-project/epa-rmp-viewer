Our plant SOP's are designed to prevent an accident from occuring and all our operators are trained in safe operating procedures. In the event that we have an ammonia leak, we have NH3 leak detectors for early detection throughout the plant that are centrally monitored 24 hours a day. A Process Safety Management program is in place. An emergency response team is trained in proper emergency response procedures and our specific plan. These emergency responders are available 24 hours per day.",

Wherever possible refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic). The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel.\n\n2.0 Rich Products and Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nRich Products Brunswick processes and cools appetizer products for national distribution. Approximately 60,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at Rich Products. A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia from the system. \n\n3.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps.\n\nRich Products complies with all rules and regulations that pertain to the safe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia. Specific regulations include: OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule; OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER); OSHA Hazard Communication (HAZCOM); OSHA Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans; EPA Risk Management Plans (RMP). \n\nSpecific prevention steps that have been implemented to increase the safety of operation of the ammonia refrigeration system include: microprocessors have been installed on all compressors to improve control and safety during a malfunction; ammonia system alarms are linked to the refrigeration office computer for improved monitoring; a mechanical integrity inspection was completed for the ammonia refrigeration system by The Stellar Group in August 2008. Security personnel are on site 24 hours, 7 days per week.\n\n4.0  Five Yea"

There is a record of the ammonia release incident on file as part of the facility Process Safety Management Program.\n\n5.0  Rich Products Emergency Response Program.\n\nRich Products maintains an ongoing emergency response program in order to efficiently notify and evacuate employees, notify potential critical receptors in the community and state and local emergency response agencies. The program includes initial and annual training for employees who respond to releases or potential releases. The program includes written procedures for proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat human exposures; procedures for using emergency response equipment and procedures to review and update the plan and ensure that employees are informed of changes. The facility emergency response plan is coordinated with the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Commission, as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act.\n\n6.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety at Rich Products.\n\nFuture plans to improve anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system safety at the Rich Products Brunswick facility include: continuing operator training, maintaining the emergency response training program; periodic Process Safety Management Program audits, and continuing management of the facility PSM program elements."
