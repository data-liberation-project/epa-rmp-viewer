If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Tri-Community Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility is a farmers cooperative. We sell propane to our cooperative customers. We have one 30000 gallon  propane tank at our disturbution site.\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:  Our worst case scenario is failure of one 30000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a pull-away explosion.  In this scenario a 25 foot length of unloading hose, 4\" in diameter is ruptured.  The release leads to a vapor cloud explosion (endpoint 1 psi).  The quantity released is 69 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is 175 feet (reported as .03 miles).\n\nThe general accidental release pervention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility compliies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Tri-Community Fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department; members of"
