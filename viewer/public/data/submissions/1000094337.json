              "Description": "The operator of the facility has addressed the facility?s responsibilities for implementing prevention measures designed to reduce the risk of an accidental release and mitigate the consequences of releases to prevent chemical exposure to employees and public receptors in the facility?s Process Safety Management (PSM) / Risk Management Program (RMP) procedures. The chlorine building is designed to contain a chlorine release and is equipped with chlorine gas detectors, automatic chlorine supply shutdown controls, and an emergency scrubber.\n\n\n\nThe facility has adopted the Chlorine Institute Pamphlets as Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practice (RAGAGEP). Piping and component materials of construction and connection types adopted for chlorine service and recommended inspections are addressed in the Chlorine Handling and Management Standardization Policy issued by the owner, the City of Phoenix.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information including process & instrumentation drawings, and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) information for the gas detectors and emergency chlorine scrubber OEM is compiled hard copy in a binder at the facility. Process Hazard analysis (PHA) revalidations are conducted every 5-years and employees representing O&M participate in the PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures are reviewed on an annual basis, updated as required, and O&M staff are trained on the procedures. Chlorine awareness training is also provided on a periodic basis by the chlorine supplier. Equipment inspections and preventative maintenance is managed through a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). Maintenance standards addressing inspection intervals (and the basis) for chlorine equipment inspection and service are addressed in a Chlorine Handling and Management Standardization Policy. Inspection protocols and frequencies are based on RAGAGEP (Chlorine Institute), OEM guidance, and operating history. Work orders are automatically generated through the CMMS based on established frequency.\n\n\n\nThe operator has documented Hot Work Permit, Management of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup safety Review (PSSR) procedures.\n\n\n\nChlorine leak detectors located in the chlorine building activate alarms (horns and beacons), the building containment controls, and the emergency chlorine scrubber upon detection of chlorine at established setpoints. The facility is a non-responding facility and coordinates emergency response with the City of Phoenix Fire Department. The facility maintains an Emergency Kit \"B\" for use by external emergency responders to containing major leaks on the chlorine containers; this kit contains devices and tools to contain leaks in and around container valves or in the side wall of a container.\n\n\n\nThe emergency chlorine scrubber can also be manually activated via local controls at the scrubber and the chlorine supply can be remotely shutdown (at the containers) via a manual emergency shutdown button located immediately outside of the main chlorine building entrance.\n\n\n\nPSM/RMP program compliance audits are conducted every 3-years.\n\n",

New River Road in Peoria, Arizona is a conventional water treatment plant that treats Central Arizona Project (CAP) canal water to potable use. The facility is operated by Veolia North America under contract to the City of Phoenix. The WTP contains a covered process subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMP), 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nThe covered process at the WTP is chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5), which is injected into the finished water for disinfection. The chlorine storage and feed system are designed to utilize one-ton chlorine containers within a fully contained building dedicated for the purpose. The chlorine system is designed to provide continuous finished water chlorine residual. The facility was initially constructed under a design, build, operate (DBO) project with Black & Veatch/McCarthy as the design team and American Water Enterprises as the Operator and the facility was commissioned in June 2007.\n\n \n\nThe facility operator has implemented Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RMP) procedures to prevent the accidental release of chlorine and to mitigate consequences should a release occur. The program follows the elements of the PSM standard. The process hazard analysis (PHA) of the covered process was most recently revalidated in June 2021 and the PSM/RMP program was most recently audited in April 2019; both of these activities were led by qualified third-party PSM consultants.\n\n\n\nThe WTP contains up to 20,000 pounds of chlorine, with 10,000 pounds \"in use.\" The chlorine feed system consists of five, one-ton containers (tonners) \"on-line\" and five tonners placed in \"stand-by\" (upon change out of the bank of containers that have been depleted).

The Operator controls the chlorine system from the Operator Control Room located within the Administrative/Operations Building. The chlorine building is a secured zone within a secured site, and all access doors to the chlorine building are secured with access controls. A two-person rule applies for all work within the chlorine building. \n\n\n\nThis is a non-responding facility and Veolia North America has implemented an Emergency Action Pan that addresses evacuation and in the event of a chlorine emergency, notification of the Fire Department will be notified.
