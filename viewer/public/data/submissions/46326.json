      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThe City of Newton, Kansas Water Department's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technology, departmental/City wide procedures, and departmental/City wide management practices.  All applicable procedures of Federal EPA and KDHE are adhered to.  Our emergency response plans are specifically geared to the Mission Water Plant Treatment Facility and it's unique requirements.\n\nThe Mission Water Plant was installed to disinfect and pump the flow of water from our 14 operational wells pumping water from the Equus Beds, a local hydro-geologic formation located within the Little Arkansas River drainage basin .  The Mission Water Treatment Plant has been in existence since the turn of the century and was completely rebuilt in 1998.  It is a state of the art water treatment, basic laboratory, and pumping facility.  Water is pumped through three pipes, a 12 inch, a 14 inch, and a 24 inch pipe to the City of Newton, Kansas.  The Plant contains Chlorination equipment and is normally staffed by one person, 40 hours per week.  Chlorine is stored in two 2000 pound cylinders.  Our water system uses no surface water.\n\n\nLOCATION & ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe Mission Water Plant is located in a rural area several miles from any incorporated city.  The surrounding environment includes pasture land with occasional farms and isolated single family homes.  A small unincorporated suburban development (14 homes) is located 1.5 miles to the West of the Mission Plant.  Domestic animals and wildlife outnumber the human population in the immediate area surrounding the plant.  US Highway 50 passes within 1.5 miles to the North of the plant.  The elevation of the land surrounding the plant gently slopes to the South.  The prevailing winds blow from the South to the North.\n\n\nSCENARIO METHODOLOGY\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis was conducted using RMP Compute version 1.03.  The worst case scenario revealed an affected area"

      "SummaryText": "radius of 2.2 miles.  LandView III version 1.0 and MarPlot version 3.2 were used to calculate the number of affected individuals.  Although the number of affected individuals totaled 376 (which seems high for this area), the inclusion of 6 block groups may have added people and households that are technically not within the area.  The close proximity of Halstead, KS (pop 2,015) to the outer edges of the worst case scenario doubtless added to most of the 376 population count.  The area within the 2.2 mile worst case scenario does not contain any schools, churches, villages, commercial enterprises, or any other locations that concentrate human population.  A major 2 lane highway, US 50, passes through the worst case scenario for about 4.5 miles on the Northern edge.  Emergency planning includes the coordination of law enforcement (Harvey County Sheriffs Office, Kansas Highway Patrol, Newton Police Department, Harvey County 911 Communications) to block and/or reroute this traffic until Incident Command gives an all clear.  The alternative release scenario was calculated at 1.3 miles in radius and the number of affected households was estimated as 33 households and 119 people.  The remaining characteristics for the alternate and worst case scenario were identical.\n\nSAFETY HISTORY\n\nThe Mission Water Plant has had no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n\nFACTORS OF MITIGATION\n\n\u00b7 High level of operator training\n\u00b7 Preventive maintenance program, computerized & manual\n\u00b7 State-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\u00b7 Effective written operating procedures, written with input from the Plant Operators\n\u00b7 Modern and new (built 1998) plant\n\u00b7 Chlorine cylinders stored within enclosed building\n\u00b7 Employees on site\n\u00b7 Rural location with low population density\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe Mission Water Plant is fitted with leak detection equipment that triggers audible and visual alarms.  In the event that Operators would not be on site, the computerized system notifies the O"
