In this food product manufacturing facility we handle more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which requires that we submit a Risk Management Plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The anhydrous ammonia is used in our refrigeration system.  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe safety precautions during it's use to protect workers, the surrounding community, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state regulations.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia combined with the safety devices that are incorporated in our facility and the safe handling procedures that our personnel are trained in.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.  McCain Foods USA, 100 West Coleman Street, Rice Lake, Wisconsin manufactures frozen onion rings.  McCain Foods is located in an industrial park on the south west side of Rice Lake, Wisconsin.  In addition to our manufacturing facility the industrial park also houses other manufacturing or business facilities. The potentially hazardous chemical used at the McCain Foods facility is anhydrous ammonia. The dominant characteristic of ammonia vapor is it's pungent, distinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations, although these levels would not result in any health risks.  Risks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of exposure.\n\n3. Worst case release scenario and alternate release scenarios were developed and submitted to the EPA as part of the Risk Management Plan.  Please contact us if you would like to discuss these scenarios and our risk"
