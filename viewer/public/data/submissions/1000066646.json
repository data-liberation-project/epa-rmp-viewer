The refrigeration system at the Joplin, MO facility is a two-stage, closed-loop, mechanical refrigeration system. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pump or pressure to the production and process area evaporators and heat exchangers for cooling and freezing purposes. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the evaporators returns to the suction vessels in the engine room. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 130 to 185 psig. The maximum allowable working pressure is 250 to 300 psig. The maximum intended ammonia inventory is 25,500 lbs.\n\n\n\nAs part of their PSM program, Ajinomoto&reg; Windsor has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, AJINOMOTO&reg; WINDSOR implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Ajinomoto&reg; Windsor to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Joplin, MO facility. The PSM program developed and implemented at Ajinomoto&reg; Windsor includes the following steps:\n\n?    Written plans for implementing employee participation in PSM.\n\n?

Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): A PHA review of the ammonia refrigeration process was conducted to identify hazards and safeguards pertaining to the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n?    Operating procedures were developed and implemented for the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\n\n?    Safe work practices were developed and implemented for lockout/tagout, confined space and opening equipment and piping. \n\n?    A Mechanical Integrity program is being implemented to maintain the on-going integrity and safety of the refrigeration system, including application of the following industry codes and standards: \n\no    ASME Boiler & Pressure Valve Codes\n\no    ANSI B31.3 Piping Code\n\no    ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 American National Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems\n\no    ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15\n\no    NFPA guidelines for fire protection equipment\n\n?    A Management of Change (MOC) program and procedures were developed to address all proposed changes to the refrigeration system.\n\n?    Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) procedures were developed.\n\n?    A detailed compliance audit checklist is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs every three years.\n\n?    Developed incident investigation procedures to analyze and review accidents or near-misses involving the refrigeration system.\n\n?    Establish a hot work permit system.\n\n?    Developed and implemented a program to evaluate contractors and contractor employees. \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAjinomoto&reg; Windsor has not had an accidental release from the ammonia refrigeration system that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAjinomoto&r"

An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been developed that includes coordination with local response agencies, procedures for employees to follow in the event of an accidental release of ammonia and a list of emergency phone numbers. Employees have been trained on how to use the plan and drills carried out annually.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Ajinomoto&reg; Windsor regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety. Currently, there are no changes planned for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n"
