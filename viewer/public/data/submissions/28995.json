Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt the Aldi Springfield, Ohio warehousing facility, we distribute perishable and non-perishable grocery items and merchandise to our retail locations throughout Ohio and surrounding states. To preserve our perishable products, we utilize an industrial refrigeration system to cool the storage areas where these items are kept. This system uses anhydrous (without water) ammonia as a refrigerant. Ammonia, a naturally occurring element, is part of the nitrogen cycle and is one of the oldest mechanical system refrigerants used. The properties that make ammonia one of the ideal industrial refrigerants for the food industry are the same ones the make it necessary to follow certain safety precautions. These precautions are designed to:\n\n?    Protect our neighbors and the surrounding community.\n?    Reduce the possibility of harm to the environment.\n?    Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n?    To reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers.\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nAt the Aldi warehouse, our primary purpose is to supply our retail stores with high quality merchandise. To maintain the quality of our perishable food items we use a two-stage refrigeration system containing a charge of Anhydrous Ammonia. The system was charged at the startup of the system during construction of the facility. The system is a closed loop system that requires no additional ammonia unless the system is expanded or if a release should occur.  Access to the refrigeration system areas and equipment is restricted to our trained and authorized system operation personnel, authorized maintenance personnel, authorized management personnel, and authorized approved contractors. We observe stringent safety and operating procedures and ensure that contractors follow these policies.\n\nThe regulated substance c"

The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule and with all applicable Federal State and Local Codes. All qualified refrigeration system operators have been trained and have demonstrated competence in our safety and standard operating procedures. Non-qualified personnel are not permitted to operate or maintain the refrigeration equipment.\n\n4.    Five year accident history.\n\nWe have had one release at this facility since construction was complete in 1993\n\nAt approximately 4:45 AM on January 23, 2002, we were alerted to a system problem by the refrigeration control system alarm. The first employees to arrive discovered an ammonia release was occurring in the perishable food storage area of our facility. The maintenance department remotely isolated the refrigerant supply from the machine room and proceeded with a pump out of the entire perishable storage area. Additional assistance was provided by our refrigeration service company, the Springfield Fire Department, The Springfield HAZMAT Team, and the Ohio EPA.\n\nThe leak was determined to be contained in our low temperature freezer area. Ventilation was started to clear the ammonia vapor from the freezer area. After visibility became adequate, a level A HAZMAT team made an entry and closed the local isolation valves.\n\nAfter the monitoring equipment showed concentrations were low enough, an entry was made to attempt to locate the failure. It was determined that a three-inch seam welded pipe had split lengthwise down the weld seam. This pipe was on a future expansion stub behind an evaporator. The line was a high pressure suction line with a defrost return line up stream of the stub.\n\nThe entire section of the pipe was removed and examined. It was determined to have an inferior seam weld in the area of the rupture. It was "

      "SummaryText": "also determined that the pipe was not properly sloped to allow liquid refrigerant to drain back to the system. As the evaporator would go through a defrost cycle, liquid trapped in the stub would be subject to a degree of hydraulic expansion. Our findings are that the combination of these factors caused the weld seam to fail over a period of several years of operation.\n\nThe expansion stub which failed was eliminated. The slope was corrected in the remaining portion of this line. All similar lines at the facility were stripped of insulation and examined. The slope was checked and corrected where necessary. Eight thousand pounds of ammonia was added to bring the system back to its original thirteen thousand pound charge.\n\n\n5.    The emergency response program.\n\nThis facilities emergency response program was developed following the guidelines in the IIAR bulletin #106 Recommended Procedures in the Event of Ammonia Spills, applicable Federal State and Local Codes, and industry  practice methods. All employees are trained in our emergency response procedures. Response to emergencies is to be handled by our facility's maintenance and supervision with backup from the fire department when necessary. Only trained and authorized employees are permitted to actively participate in direct response to emergencies.\n\n\n6.    The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst Case scenario\n\nA rupture of a roof top liquid refrigerant supply line between the engine room and cold storage areas would release the system charge of 13,000 pounds of ammonia. It is assumed that the entire system contents are released as a liquid. Company policy restricts access to the rooftop areas to authorized employees and contractors. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\nDistance to toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (basis ERPG-2) for the worst "

      "SummaryText": "case scenario is 0.7 miles (1.1 kilometers)\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nAn engine room pipe severed by a piece of material handling equipment. The system charge is released at a rate of 719.58 pounds per minute. The ammonia is confined to the engine room with an area of 2950 square feet. This would yield a release rate to the outside air of 25.8 pounds per minute.\n \nDistance to toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (basis ERPG-2) for the alternative scenario is less than 0.1 miles (0.16 kilometers)\n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nConstruction of this facility was completed in 1993 in compliance with applicable Federal, State, and Local building codes as well as ANSI standards and IIAR Guidelines. A mechanical integrity audit was performed in May of 2002 and any potential problem areas identified by the audit are being addressed.\n\nDuring the first portion of 2003, there were several changes made to improve safety. The emergency exhaust fan on the machine room roof was changed to an updraft style unit with weather dampers. The fire department emergency refrigerant control box was replaced with new equipment.\n\nOur system is now under a preventative maintenance contract with a qualified service company. Maintenance is being performed following our schedule on a monthly basis. \n\nLater this year we plan to correct a problem we have identified with the valve configuration on several of the evaporator units. The new valves and associated controls will improve the smoothness of the defrost cycles and help minimize component stress during the defrost cycles. All necessary and recommended maintenance will be performed on the system."
