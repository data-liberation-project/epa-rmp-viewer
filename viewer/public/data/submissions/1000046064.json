It does this through as series of physical and chemical treatment operations that include bar screens, vortex grit removal, pre-aeration, seven primary clarifiers, three B.O.D. trickling filters, two intermediate clarifiers, two nitrification filters, one final clarifier, a chlorine contact mixing vault, detention chamber and sulfur dioxide dechlorination. The effluent is then discharged in the Red River. The designed capacity of the plant is 15 million gallons per day. The regulated substances stored, handled, and used at this facility are sulfur dioxide and chlorine. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored in one ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 8 containers of chlorine & 4 containers of sulfur dioxide on site. All containers are stored inside the chlorination building. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored and used on site from April 1 to October 31 for disinfection and dechlorination requirements. All containers are removed fron the site from November 1 to March 31.\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention program\r\nThe facility's prevention program for both sulfur dioxide and chlorine complies with EPA's 40 CFR part 68 rule for program 2 processes, to maintain this compliance, the City has in place many procedural and techonological safeguards. The procedural safeguards include an employee-training program and operation and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operation the covered processes. The technological safeguards include controls, sensors, alarms, and industry-standard systems. All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of sulfur dioxide and chlorine. Should the prevention program fail to prevent a release, the WWTP is equipped with engineering controls designed to minimize the effect of the release on the surrounding community. For chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the storage containers are kept inside of a building to mitigate the effects of a release. The pl"

This training includes the safe handling of regulated substances under the rule. The City has also developed and maintained a risk management policy that contains general safety rules. Though these rules do not specifically address the covered processes and their regulated substances, compliance with the general rules significalntly reduces the potential for accidental releases of the regulated substances. This facility complies with industry-standard practices for wastewater treatment plants that use sulfur dioxide and chlorine in bulk. As for emergency response, the City has established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and response. These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur. In general, the City would deal only with releases of a small amount of a regulated substance.
