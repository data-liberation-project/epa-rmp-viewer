On May 21, 2019 First Responders from TVFR Hazmat team, City of Cornelius Fire Department, City of Forest Grove Fire Department, including the Forest Grove Fire Marshall and City of Gaston Fire Department visited and toured the Joint Water Commission Water Treatment Plant and discussed emergency response plan. Planning and discussions are currently in progress for similar visits in 2024.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThere have been no major unresolved process hazards identified in the chlorine system at the Water Treatment Plant.\nPrevious Audits and Inspections:\nEPA performed an onsite inspection of our RMP in August of 2009. \nOregon OSHA performed a Compliance Inspection in January 2015. \n\nScheduled Internal Audits and Reviews:\nNext Compliance Audit is scheduled for August 2026. \nNext Operating Procedures Review is scheduled for July 2024."

The same data is being used for the 2024 submission due to the census data not being updated in the RMP*Comp and Marplot programs since the 2019 submission. \n\nChlorine Worst Case:  The failure due to a corrosion, impact or construction defect for a filled a one-ton cylinder would release 2000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration at 110 pounds per minute.  The distance to end point would be approximately 2.20 miles. Data from the 2010 census provided by Marplot in March of 2019 indicates that there are approximately 7,200 people that reside in the release zone. \n\nChlorine Alternate Scenario:  Assuming a disk rupture or valve failure, a release of a one-ton cylinder at a 30 minute duration would release 315 pounds over an impact distance of .1 miles. Data from the 2010 census provided by Marplot in March of 2019 indicates that there are 0 people living within the release zone of this scenario. \n \n4. Emergency Response Program\n\nAlthough an accidental chlorine release is unlikely, the Water Treatment Plant has prepared for such a release as well as other emergencies.  The plant has developed an emergency action plan that complies with 29 CFR 1910.38. In the event of an emergency, key personnel will perform critical tasks to ensure proper containment and/or plant shut down, then evacuate the premises or shelter in place, as deemed appropriate by the acting Incident Commander. \n\nA chemical emergency would involve the Regional Hazardous Materials Response Team, which will be summoned by Forest Grove Fire Department as necessary.  Incident Command will remain with the Fire Department. Training exercises are planned with the cooperation of the Forest Grove Fire Department's Training Officer. The Water Plant coordinated with Forest Grove Fire and the Regional Hazmat team for an exercise event in 2014 and was followed up by several tours of the Water Treatment Plant"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) for the Hillsboro, Forest Grove, Beaverton, Tualatin Valley Water District Joint Commission Water Treatment Plant, which handles a substance regulated in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, Appendix A.  The RMP Registration Report recorded by the EPA is included as Attachment 14 A.\n\n1. Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe, Hillsboro, Forest Grove, Beaverton, Tualatin Valley Water District Joint Commission Water Treatment Plant, hereafter referred to as the Water Treatment Plant, is managed and operated by City of Hillsboro personnel.  The regulated substance handled is chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the US EPA.\n\nGaseous chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders located in the facility chlorine storage room.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored at the facility is 18,000 lbs. (9 tons).\n\n2. Accidental Release & Emergency Prevention Program\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant takes a systematic proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chlorine.  The plant is strictly covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  The prevention of accidental releases depends on adherence to the procedures used to handle chlorine, the safety equipment systems designed and constructed in the facility, and the training of personnel.  The RMP/PSM manual, Hazard Communication Program, and other various safety programs are kept in the conference room library for employee access and review.\n\nEngineering controls have been added as part of the prevention program to limit the impact of each submitted scenario.  A chlorine scrubber has been installed which is designed to capture and treat the contents of an entire one-ton cylinder.  The system is also under a vacuum regulator that would cut off flow if a leak in the chlorine piping should occur. \n\n3. Worst Case Scenario & Alternate Release Scenarios"
