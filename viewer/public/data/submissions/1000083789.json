During these meeting we also discuss \r\npreventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nVentura Coastal - Visalia has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Ventura Coastal - Visalia facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 17,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nVentura Coastal - Visalia has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nVentura Coastal - Visalia's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\nCal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Admin"

The emergency ventilation system can be controlled manually by the HAND/OFF/AUTO switches or the emergency break glass switches outside each machinery room door.\r\n\r\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment. All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves. The high side of each system relieves at either 250 or 300 psig while the low side of each system relieves at 150 or 250 psig.

From the liquid recirculators, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the screw compressors.\r\n\r\nThe system also includes direct expansion (DX) ceiling suspended evaporator coils. In DX evaporators, high pressure liquid is supplied from the high pressure receiver directly to the evaporators. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporators. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporators and is returned to the main suction accumulator.\r\n\r\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within each condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating. \r\n\r\nSafety Systems\r\n\r\nAt an ammonia concentration of 25 ppm, an alarm is activated on the PLC, and necessary personnel are automatically notified via email.
