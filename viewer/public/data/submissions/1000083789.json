In this system, high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to the liquid recirculators, ceiling-suspended evaporators, and some jacketed storage tanks, heat exchangers, and accumulators. The liquid recirculators are equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the liquid recirculators. Low pressure liquid is pumped from the liquid recirculators to the penthouse evaporators, and various jacketed storage tanks and heat exchangers located throughout the facility. \n\n\n\nThe evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. In the jacketed storage tanks, the low temperature liquid is pumped into piping within the tank that extends around the tank wall. In the plate and frame heat exchangers, the low temperature liquid flows through channels in the plates and absorbs the heat from the product on the opposite side of each plate. In the shell and tube heat exchanger, the low pressure liquid enters the vesse"

As the liquid ammonia absorbs heat from the product or air, it evaporates to form low temperature and pressure vapor and returns to the liquid recirculators. From the liquid recirculators, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the screw compressors.\n\n\n\nThe system also includes direct expansion (DX) ceiling suspended evaporator coils. In DX evaporators, high pressure liquid is supplied from the high pressure receiver directly to the evaporators. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporators. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporators and is returned to the main suction accumulator.\n\n\n\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within each condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating. \n\n\n\nSafety Systems\n\n\n\nAt an ammonia concentration of 25 ppm, an alarm is activated on the PLC, and necessary personnel are automatically notified via email. At 50 ppm, the muster system is activated which includes activating a blue light (blue indicates ammonia) inside the production rooms. Additionally, the muster system will activate audible alarms plant-wide at 50 ppm. At an ammonia concentration inside the machinery room exceeding 150 ppm, the compressors are automatica"

This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressor.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Pressure Control System (EPCS) operates as follows: \n\n- EPCS is activated at not greater than 90% pressure relief valve setting (e.g. 270 psig or less) [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.3] \n\n- Upon activation, all compressors are stopped by a means that is independent of all other safety controls [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.6] \n\n- Upon activation, cross-over valve is opened [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.6] \n\n- Upon activation, a signal is provided to personnel responsible for refrigeration system maintenance [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.7] \n\n- EPCS remains active until manually reset [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.8]\n\n- EPCS crossover isolation valves are locked open [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.4.2] \n\n- The emergency pressure control system is seldom used in a refrigeration system, but has been installed for rare emergency situations.\n\n\n\nProcess Classification\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Ventura Coastal - Visalia consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration "

During these meeting we also discuss \n\npreventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nVentura Coastal - Visalia has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Ventura Coastal - Visalia facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 17,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nVentura Coastal - Visalia has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nVentura Coastal - Visalia's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\nCal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Admin"

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Ventura Coastal - Visalia has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Ventura Coastal - Visalia now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Ventura Coastal - Visalia employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Ventura Coastal - Visalia will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
