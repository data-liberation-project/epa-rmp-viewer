      "SummaryText": "ES-1\tIntroduction\n\nThe Yucaipa Valley Water District\u00c2\u00bfs Henry N. Wochholz Regional Water Recycling Facility (Wochholz RWRF) previously used chlorine for disinfection of wastewater effluent followed by dechlorination with sulfur dioxide to provide safe water discharges to the environment. The District replaced its method of disinfection with ultraviolet light in 2008; therefore the District has eliminated its need for sulfur dioxide and has reduced its previous chlorine storage by half.  The District is currently not using chlorine in any process on the plant site. A maximum of four one-ton cylinders is currently being stored. The District was planning to use this chlorine to dose its return activated sludge (RAS) line in its secondary process. However, the District is not currently chlorinating the RAS and intends to install a sodium hypochlorite system prior to resuming chlorination. At this time, the District plans to eliminate the use and storage of chlorine gas. \n\nStoring and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The District takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing the environment safe disinfected water.  The Wochholz RWRF chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tGeneral facility and regulated substances information.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tSummary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tFive-year accident history summary.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEmer"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \nThe Wochholz RWRF emergency response policy involves the preparation of Emergency Response Plan which is tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The District has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for chlorine to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with local response agencies, such as the San Bernardino County Fire Department.  The Wochholz RWRF has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nES-3\tGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Wochholz RWRF is located on 880 W. County Line Road, in Yucaipa, California.  The plant has operated since 1986.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages from the original 3.0 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) to current capacity of 6.7 mgd.  The wastewater treated at the plant originates mainly from approximately 13,259 domestic and industrial users in the communities of Yucaipa, Calimesa, and unincorporated areas of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process followed by tertiary filtration"

The District intends to install liquid sodium hypochlorite facilities in lieu of using chlorine gas. The chlorination system consists of four one-ton chlorine containers, three chlorine detectors, three chlorinators and injectors, residual analyzers, mixers, chlorine contact tanks, piping and other equipment.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present in the chlorine storage room can be as much as four tons.  Four one ton containers in two separate \u00c2\u00bfbanks\u00c2\u00bf are connected for gas draw-off to a chlorine supply header.  One \u00c2\u00bfbank\u00c2\u00bf may be put on-line while the other \u00c2\u00bfbank\u00c2\u00bf is on standby status.  The system is provided with an automatic switch over.\nIn case of a major leak, the chlorine gas analyzers are used to sense chlorine leaks in the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms.  Upon detection of approximately 2 ppm chlorine, the analyzers will send a signal which will shut down the normal ventilation system to contain the chlorine gas within the chlorine storage room.  The caustic scrubber system is activated in the event of a chlorine leak. The District reviewed the scrubber in depth in August 2007 and made any needed repairs. \nThe Wochholz RWRF is manned 10.5 hours per day.  During the hours that the plant is unmanned all critical alarms are linked to an auto-dialer system via the SCADA computer.  Access to the Wochholz RWRF is through gates, which are closed after regular hours.\n\nThe Wochholz RWRF is also provided with an emergency generator.  \n\nES-4\tSummary of Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nThe Wochholz RWRF is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements."

This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to go and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately addressed.  This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process is safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate it.\n \nThe Wochholz RWRF uses a manual system that assures inspection, testing, and maintenance of chlorination equipment is performed in accordance with the manufacturer and industry groups (i.e., Chlorine Institute) recommendations.\n\nES-11\tHot Work Permits and Management of Change (MOC)\n\nThe District requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \u00c2\u00bfhot work\u00c2\u00bf in, on, or around the covered process.  The Wochholz RWRF uses a permitting and training program to ensure hot work is conducted safely on or near a process involving chlorine.\n\nThe Wochholz RWRF provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions. This system allows Wochholz RWRF staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\n\nES-12\tIncident Investigation\n\nThe District investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so th"

      "SummaryText": "at similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nES-13\tFive-Year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Wochholz RWRF during the last ten years.\n\nES-14\tEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe District is a first responder. Wochholz RWRF employees respond to chlorine accidental releases.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the San Bernardino County Fire Department may be solicited to aid in handling a chlorine release.  As part of the emergency response program, the District has developed an Emergency Response Plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.\n\nThe main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) initial discovery equipment and procedure, (2) response to an emergency, including procedures for immediate action and internal notifications, and (3) procedures for external notifications, including coordination with local agencies.\n\nES-15\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of the preparation of a Risk Management Program, a PHA was performed for the chlorination system.  The PHA was performed using the What If/Checklist technique and covered both equipment and procedures used for the chlorine system. The recommendations are:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPost list of emergency phone numbers in chlorination room.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tImprove pipe labeling showing flow direction and pipe contents\n\u00c2\u00bf\tUpdate drawings to show current chlorination facilities and removal of sulfur dioxide system.

However, whether the other items are implemented will depend on whether or not the gas chlorine system will be used again at the plant. Currently, the gas chlorine system is scheduled for demolition and it will be replaced with liquid sodium hypochlorite."
