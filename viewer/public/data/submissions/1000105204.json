Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, KDC West has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP/PSM/CalARP Program implementation.\n\nKDC West considers the RMP/PSM/CalARP Program a \u0093living document\u0094. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for KDC West employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, KDC West has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP/PSM/CalARP related activities. \n\n1.1 KDC West, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that KDC West has updated/developed their unified RMP/PSM/CalARP Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nNorth System\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n18,000\n\nSouth System\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n9,800\n\nOur RMP/PSM/CalARP Program promotes overall plant, worker, public, and environmental safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.
