As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC has completed a 5-Year Update to its risk management plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that will be above reporting thresholds.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically isopentane and pentane, as constituents of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant and aqueous ammonia.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an serious accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC to notify the local fire department and the Cassia County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as wet distiller's grain, which is used as a livestock feed.  Aqueous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored the the facility is 34,000 gallons or 260,000 pounds. The concentration will be less than 30%. The ammonia tank is located in a concrete containment dike.\n\n\n\nThe supply and chemical make-up of denaturant is dependent upon market rates and the source of the natural gasoline, making it difficult for the facility to foresee with muc"

Therefore, Pacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC has chosen to file this RMP predictively in light of the variable nature of the denaturant supply and has prepared this RMP based on a typical denaturant that contains approximately 21 percent isopentane and 24 percent pentane. The maximum amount of denaturant (flammable mixture) on-site is estimated to be approximately 52,000 gallons or 300,000 pounds (64,000 pounds of isopentane and 73,000 pounds of pentane). The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank (in containment) as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  Pacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it relates to the reportable substances. An emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Pacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts periodic drills.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough the completion of this RMP, Pacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC has not had an accident which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last 5 years.  The facility started operations in April 2008.  The plant was idled from Nov 2008 until Dec 2009.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPacific Ethanol Ma"
