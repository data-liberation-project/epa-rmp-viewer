Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n        The Cypress Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that integrates areas such as design, installation, management practices, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorination and dechlorination process at our facility. The chlorination and dechlorination system at our plant is designed to meet industry standards and is well maintained. Appropriate controls and alarms are also in place to prevent possible releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Furthermore, all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program Level 2 are adhered to.\n\n    In the event an accidental release does occur, our facility is coordinated with the Lauderdale County Emergency Management Agency, local fire and police departments, as well as, Harcros Chemicals in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. These institutions provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.    Our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\n    Our facility is a publicly owned wastewater treatment plant. Our primary activity is treating municipal wastewater from the City of Florence, AL for discharge into the Tennessee River. We have two regulated substances, Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide. Chlorine is used for disinfecting the wastewater and to aid in plant operation.  The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 16,000 pounds. Sulfur Dioxide is used for dechlorinating the chlorinated wastewater at our facility. The maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide at our facility is 16,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.

To perform the required scenario analyses for our facility, we used Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)] models and analysis. For the sulfur dioxide and chlorine worst case and alternative case release scenarios ALOHA analyses were run using ALOHA version 5.4.3. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n     The worst case scenario, as required by EPA, assumes the maximum quantity of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified failure. Our largest vessel for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is a ton (2,000 pounds) container. Neither passive nor active mitigation was considered. At class F atmospheric stability, a 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a temperature of 101?aF, a maximum distance of 3.0 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine and a maximum distance of 3.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L for sulfur dioxide. The potentially affected residential population was estimated to be approximately 22,629 for the chlorine release and 24,186 for the sulfur dioxide release. Schools, residences, hospitals, prisons, public recreational areas, and major commercial, office, or industrial areas were all public receptors that were found within the radius of the worst case release scenario. One environmental receptor, the Seven Mile Island Wildlife Refuge, was identified in the toxic endpoint area.\n\n    The alternative release scenario assumes the chlorine and sulfur dioxide release is less severe and is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario. The scenario chosen for both substances involves a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the 5/16 diameter valve body opening at the top of"

The methodology used to carry out this analysis is a hazard review checklist specifically designed for water plants. This checklist was designed to meet the requirements of The Chlorine Manual published by The Chlorine Institute and \"The Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\", published by EPA. The analyses are performed by qualified personnel and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n    Operating Procedures\n\n    For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorination and dechlorination process, our facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a change. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the chlorination and dechlorination process.\n\n\n\n    Training\n\n    Our facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.
