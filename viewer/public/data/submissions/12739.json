      "SummaryText": "This is a seasonal/operational facility-operating in the spring planting season and the fall tillage season.  It is located on the west side of Cooperstown, North Dakota.  It consists of two 30,000 gallons Anhydrous Ammonia storagevessels.   Customer's nurse tanks are filled at the facility.  It is not required to be operational year round.  When the facility is not in use, it is locked down and power is off.  It is in both federal and state compliance.\n \nAll employees are required to attend an annual safe-handling  and training school.  A written safety program is on file with the Griggs County Emergency Director, and the local fire department and emergency personnel have maps of the plant.\n\nA worst case release scenario would occur if product were to be released into the atmosphere due to overfilling or overpressurization of the storage vessel.  Devices in place to prevent this from occurring include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs.  The vessels are never filled to more than 85% capacity.  \n\nAn alterntative case release scenario would be if a customer were to pull away from the pumping platform whic could result in a ruptured hose.  Qualified, trained  personnel are in place to prevent this from happening.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at this site in the past 5 years."
