      "SummaryText": "Reedsville Cooperative Assn. serves primarily the farm and rural community in the Reedsville and Rockwood, Wisconsin area.  We provide a variety of products for both the farm and home.  Among the products we supply you will find anhydrous ammonia.  Our farmer customers use anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer for efficiently growing quality corn crops.\n\n     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers this product \"hazardous\" and requires us to develop a risk management plan to deal with possible releases.  The nature of the product requires us to handle it with respect.  Our goal is to provide this valuable product as safely as possible.  In our plan we outline ways to protect the health and property of our surrounding neighbors.  We all share the air, water, and soil around us, and we strive to do our part to protect the environment by responsible use of our products.\n\n     As a guide to safely handling the product we rely on a number of sources.  Primarily, we follow the federal, state, and local regulations governing the storage and delivery of the product.  However, we also stress a strong safety training program and close supervision of employees handling the product.  We also use information on equipment and training from trade associations and vendors.  Lastly, our insurance companies are exposed to the real life accident experience involving the product.  Through their loss control specialists, they forward the lessons they learned to us.\n\n     Our safety record for these product shows our  concern and care resulted in no reportable accidents in over five years.  The record of our industry shows a strong safety record.  1994 data from the U.S. Department of Transportation reveals only 22 deaths due to transporting all hazardous materials.  Compare this to 1,150 who died of bee stings and 850 bicycle deaths during the same period.\n\n     The EPA required us to complete \"worst case and alternate scenarios\" for the product in our plan.
