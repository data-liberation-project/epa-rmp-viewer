      "SummaryText": "STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES - This Risk Management Program is designed to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations detailed in 40 CFR Part 68.  The stationary source is the Prestage Foods facility at 4470 NC Highway 20 East, St. Pauls, NC.  The only RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia - which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system in this facility does not meet the requirements of Program 1.  It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY This facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), standard \"Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals\" under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nPROCESS CHEMISTRY The process is the standard refrigeration cycle.  It uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The ammonia changes state from a liquid to a gas and back to a liquid.  It does not chemically change; it is not consumed and does not wear out.  It continuously circulates throughout the system.  The refrigeration system lowers the liquid pressure to lower the boiling point to attract the heat from the room/product.  It then compresses the ammonia into a high pressure/temperature gas and cools the gas until it condenses to a liquid.  The condensed liquid is pumped to a low pressure part of the system where the pressure is lowered and the cycle starts all over.\r\n  \r\nPROCESS OVERVIEW This food processing facility operates two (2) multi-temperature, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration systems with engine room capaciti"

This refrigeration system is a liquid recirculating system and is designed to operate with an overfeed-ratio of approximately 3:1 for evaporative air units.  Anhydrous ammonia is a Group II refrigerant.  Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system.\r\n  \r\nMITIGATION MEASURES There are some mitigating measures in place.  Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off.  Ammonia leak detection is installed in areas that sound alarms and will start the emergency ventilation systems.  The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof, which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders.  It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\r\n \r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT The hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements.  The definitions and parameters for the release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\" and Subpart B Hazard Assessment under 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM This facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP.  Following is an overview.  \r\nEmployee Participation - The Employee Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents.  Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures."

Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program including participation during any Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and performing mechanical integrity procedures and participating in compliance audits.  Community involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and LEPC.\r\n  \r\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information.  These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping.  There are two major categories of process safety information: Hazards of the process chemical and technology of the process.  Hazards of the process chemical are found in the following  anhydrous ammonia -Safety Data Sheet (SDS), including safety information, first aid, chemical properties, International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) safety bulletins, etc.; Technology of the process  are found within the  Piping & Instrument Diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, relief system design and basis information, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, manufacturer's operating and maintenance manuals.\r\n  \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the \"What-if/checklist\" technique.  This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact.  The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findi"

Topics include general information such items as objectives,  hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments.  The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary, and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.\r\n  \r\nTraining - All employees who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the anhydrous ammonia SDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.  \r\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system.  The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids.\r\n  \r\nPre-Startup Safety Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems.  This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\r\n  \r\nMechanical Integrity - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.

Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area.  The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met.  Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done.  The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\r\n  \r\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect.  The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\r\n  \r\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed.  Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team.
