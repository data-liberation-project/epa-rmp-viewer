The pulp \nmill was built in the 1930s and was owned by the Soundview Pulp Company until the early 1950s, \nwhen it was purchased by Scott Paper Company.  Scott Paper added paper machines and owned \nthe operation until it merged with Kimberly-Clark Corporation in 1995.\n\nIn the sulfite pulping operation, softwood and hardwood chips are cooked in batch digesters \nutilizing ammonium bisulfite cooking acid prepared on site.  The cooking separates the pulp fibers \nfrom the binding material (lignin) which holds them together.  To prepare the cooking acid, sulfur \ndioxide gas (SO2) is mixed with an aqueous solution of ammonia (NH3).\n\nThe sulfur dioxide is primarily generated by burning elemental sulfur, but is also reclaimed from \nthe recovery boiler flue gas.  Alternatively, it is obtained by the purchase of pressurized SO2 gas.  \nThis purchased \"liquid SO2\" is brought in by truck and stored in two 100-ton tanks located inside \nthe pulp digester building.  This quantity of SO2 is above the 5000 pound threshold for the Risk \nManagement Program; consequently, it is subject to the RMP regulations.  \n\nThe ammonia is brought to the site in anhydrous form via 80 ton rail cars.  This quantity exceeds \nthe 10,000 pound RMP threshold"

      "SummaryText": " for anhydrous ammonia; consequently, it is subject to the RMP \nregulations.  The ammonia is pumped from the rail cars and diluted with water prior to storage in a \n150,000 gallon tank.  The aqueous ammonia is stored at approximately 20% strength; this quantity \nstored exceeds the 20,000 pound RMP threshold for aqueous ammonia, so aqueous ammonia is \nalso subject to the RMP regulations.  The ammonia solution is employed on site not only to \nprepare the cooking acid, but also for pollution control: it is used as a reactant in the sulfite \nrecovery boiler to remove nitrogen oxides from air emissions, and it is used in the mill's secondary \nwastewater treatment plant to provide the nutrients needed for proper operation.  It is also used to \nbuffer concentrated spent sulfite liquor prior to storage. \n\nPulp leaving the digesters is transported to three counter-current pressure washers; weak spent \nsulfite liquor from the washers is transported to multiple effect evaporators where it is \nconcentrated.  The concentrated sulfite liquor is then burned in the sulfite recovery boiler to \ngenerate steam.  \n\nAfter washing, the sulfite pulp is bleached.  The bleach plant currently utilizes three bleaching \nstages: chlorination, caustic extraction with oxygen, and hypochlorite.  Chlorine, used directly in \nthe chlorination stage and indirectly for the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite bleach liquor, is \npurchased directly and stored on site.\n\nThe chlorine is imported to the mill by rail car and is presently forced out of the car to a storage \ntank utilizing a nitrogen pressure pad.  A pressure pad is also used to push the chlorine from the \ntank to the bleaching process.  After approximately September 1, the tank will be abandoned and \nthe chlorine will be forced to the process directly, again using nitrogen as the driver.  The total \nquantity of chlorine connected at one time is 90 tons.  As the threshold quantity for chlorine is \n2,500 pounds, chlorine is a covered RMP chemical"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nUnder the terms of the EPA Cluster Rule, the mill is converting to an elemental chlorine free \n(ECF) bleaching process, which will be in operation by April 15, 2001.  The revised process will \nalso consist of three stages: chlorine dioxide, caustic extraction with oxygen and peroxide, and \nchlorine dioxide.  A new chlorine dioxide generator will be constructed on site; elemental chlorine \nwill no longer be used.  A revised Risk Management Plan will be submitted to EPA prior to the \nstartup of the new bleaching system.\n\n\nKimberly-Clark's Safety Program\n\nWe at Kimberly-Clark view safety as the most important  aspect of our operations.  Consequently, \nnot only what we do, but also how we do it is of utmost importance to us at Kimberly-Clark; this \nworld-class safety philosophy extends to all facets of our operations.   The mill's chemical safety \nrecord speaks for itself: over the past five years, there have been no deaths, injuries, or significant \nproperty damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, or \nenvironmental damage caused by accidental releases from RMP covered processes. \n\nThe facility employs a full time Safety Manager and three environmental professionals.  An  \nenvironmental engineer monitors the Process Safety and Risk Management programs, ensuring the \nelements of these programs as listed below are properly executed.  In addition, the mill maintains \nan emergency response (HazMat) team staffed with trained individuals; this team is available 24 \nhours a day.  The HazMat team conducts quarterly drills to respond to simulated chemical \naccidents.  A plant health and safety committee, composed of representatives from both the \nsalaried and hourly work force, meets regularly to review all aspects of safety at the site.  Finally, \nthe company's insurance carrier, Factory Mutual, conducts annual audits which includes \nevaluation of the safety of process equipment.      \n\nFor equipment and operations associated wit"

This modification greatly reduced the \namount of chlorine stored at the mill.  Previously the mill stored anhydrous chlorine at the \nfacility in a 720 ton shore tank.  \n \n From June until September of this year, 55 ton rail cars will unload directly to this existing tank.  \nThe quantity stored in the tank has been administratively limited to a maximum of 90 tons.  \nWhen the tank level drops below 35 tons, filling from a 55 ton rail car can commence. \nOperators will check and record tank levels utilizing the tank level gauge, to insure that \nunloading does not commence until less than 35 tons is in the tank.\n \n After September of this year, a new rail car unloading station will be in place and the chlorine \nshore tank will be demolished.  Chlorine will be forced directly to the bleach plant from \nrail cars.  At this point the mill will begin utilizing 90 ton rail cars, reducing the number of \ntrips and unloading events required. \n \nFuture Discontinuation of Elemental Chlorine Usage\n \n Kimberly-Clark is completing engineering design for a new bleach plant that will use aqueous \nchlorine dioxide instead of elemental chlorine.  After the new bleach plant is completed in \nthe year 2000 the mill will no longer use elemental chlorine.  This will provide less \ntransportation risk as chlorine rail cars will no"

If a natural disaster or \nchemical release occurs during these hours (Monday - Friday, 9 - 5) responders can \nactivate the \"Emergency Broadcast System\" and send an alert to local television and radio \nreceivers.

      "SummaryText": "nce with EPA's rule, two general types of hypothetical accidental \nrelease scenarios were developed:\n \nThe \"Administrative Worst-Case Release\" that arbitrarily assumes the entire contents of the \nlargest container of chemical is released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  Kimberly-Clark is \nunaware of any conceivable event that could actually cause such a catastrophic release at the \nEverett mill.\n \n\"Alternate Release Scenarios\", which are releases that the safety review teams concluded \nhave a realistic (but small) chance of actually occurring at the mill. These hypothetical releases \ngenerally consist of flange leaks, temporary process upsets, and breakage to pipes or tanks. \n\n1.    Worst-Case Release Scenario for Chlorine  \n\nAnhydrous liquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient \ntemperature) is imported to the site by rail car and stored in a tank, the contents of which is \nlimited to 90 tons.  (As discussed previously, after ca. September 1, 1999, the tank will no \nlonger be used, and chlorine will be drawn directly from 90 ton rail cars).  The \nAdministrative Worst-Case Release Scenario assumes that the entire 90 tons of chlorine in \nthe tank or in a car are emitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of \nexceptionally calm winds and stagnant atmospheric conditions (1.5 meter/second wind \nspeed and \"F stability\") that would result in minimal dispersion of the gas cloud as it blew \ndownwind.   \n\n    At a recent technical conference, a speaker from a southern mill put the worst case release \nscenario into perspective.  He calculated that a discharge of the entire contents of a 90 ton \nchlorine rail car in 10 minutes would require blasting a 3 foot diameter hole into the car.  \nSince the car is stationary when on the plant site, it is difficult to conceive what sort of \nforce short of an asteroid collision could cause such a cavity.   EPA's scenario \ncontemplating full evaporation in 10 minutes is equally extraordinary.  T"

If the 90 tons of liquid chlorine was somehow discharged from \nthe tank or car it would spill onto the ground and immediately cool itself until it formed a \npuddle of ice, which would take much longer than 10 minutes to evaporate into a gas \ncloud.  To evaporate the chlorine in 10 minutes would require a heat source equivalent to a \nsmall boiler, but no such heat source is present in the vicinity of the chlorine storage area.  \nFinally, this imaginary heat source would create convection currents, increasing the height \nof the plume.  But EPA's modeling directive assumes the gas cloud remains at ground \nlevel.  Thus the worst case release scenario violates the laws of physics and provides little \nuseful information.   \n\nNevertheless, the RMP rule dictates that the Worst-Case Scenario assumes the release of \n90 tons of gaseous chlorine, so Kimberly-Clark used the most recent \"RMP*Comp\" \ncomputer model to estimate the downwind impacts for the 90 ton chlorine release.  The \nmodel was set to use \"Urban\" surface roughness conditions to account for urban areas, \nrolling terrain, and coniferous forest in the Everett vicinity.
