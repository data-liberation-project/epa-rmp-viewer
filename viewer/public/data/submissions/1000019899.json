As requested by EPA, a separate RMP was prepared and submitted to EPA for the USAG's WTP 1 due to the distance separating it from WTP 3.  This RMP complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, under Section 112 (r) of the CAA Amendments of 1990, 40 CFR Part 68, also called the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  \n\nThe chlorination system at WTP 3 uses chlorine gas that is fed from 1-ton liquid chlorine containers.  Chlorine is the only chemical used at the USAG's WTP 3 that is subject to the RMP Rule; therefore, it is the only process examined. This document summarizes the USAG's WTP 3 Risk Management Plan's health and safety programs, policies, procedures, and the ongoing actions of the internal management and incident response team that are designed to prevent or minimize health and environmental impacts of accidental releases of chlorine at this facility.  To date, the USAG has had an accident-free record of chlorine usage and storage at WTP 3, which is attributable to the safety of the process and the focus on employees training in safety, proper operating procedures, effective maintenance procedures, and emergency response procedures. \n\nThe USAG has contracted the operation of WTP 3 to a private installation support contractor (Wolf Creek Federal Services, Inc.).  The personnel employed by this contractor operate and maintain WTP 3, the chlorine storage facility, the chlorination system, process, and equipment.  The installation support contractor and his employees are re"

The USAG has implemented extensive safety precautions and has a Fire Department with well trained and fully equipped Hazmat personnel.  The USAG has in place proactive procedures for improving and maintaining the safety of WTP 3 operations by using reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include leak detectors and alarms; awareness training programs for installation and contractor's personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; plus programs to evaluate potential hazards associated with operations at WTP 3.  The USAG requires the installation support contractor operating WTP 3 to use personnel trained in the operation of the chlorine storage and chlorination system/equipment. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release of hazardous chlorine, the installation support contractor personnel is required to notify the USAG's Fire Department immediately at 911 and then evacuate the area.  The USAG's Fire Department personnel respond to control and contain the release in a manner that is safe for personnel working in the area and helps prevent injury to the public or the environment.  The USAG provides response training to its personnel and to the installation support contractor personnel upon request, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the Fire Department.\n\n\n\n3.0  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Information\n\nWater Treatment Plant 3 is located approximately in the center of Redstone A"

Industrial water from WTP 1 is treated at WTP 3 to purify it to domestic potable water standards in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. \n\nWTP 3 draws industrial water from two open-top storage reservoirs and filters it through six rapid sand filters to produce potable water.  The industrial water pumped to WTP 3 is theated with chlorine, filtered through the sand filters, chlorinated again, and then pumped into a 360,000 gallons clearwell where it is  disbursed into the drinking water distribution system.  WTP 3 has a capacity of 4.6 mgd of potable water with an average flow of 3 mgd during normal operation.\n\nWTP 3 currently stores a maximum of four 1-ton cylinders of chlorine for a total storage capacity of 8,000 pounds.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the 1-ton chlorine cylinders during the chlorination process.  The chlorine storage at WTP 3 exceeds the threshold quantity (TQ) of 2,500 pounds listed in the RMP Rule.  WTP 3 has had no accidental releases of chlorine that led to an offsite impact in the last 5 years.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the WTP 3 chlorination process is 22131, but it is not among the NAICS codes covered under the RMP Rule.  However, the chlorine storage at WTP 3 is subject to the OSHA PSM standard; therefore, they are considered as Program Level 3 processes.  \n\n\n\n4.0  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis as required by the RMP Rule.  No changes have been required since the USAG's WTP 3 RMP December 2010 submission.\n\n\n\n4.1  Chlorine Hazard Assessment - Worst-case Scenario\n\nFor the worst-case release scenario (WRS) at WTP 3, the USAG evaluated the offsite impacts associated with the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel or pipe over a 10-minute duration.  The released liquid was assumed to quickly volatilize and to disperse as a vapor cloud.  The maximum di"

This circular distance to the toxic endpoint was used to evaluate the offsite impacts. \n\n\n\n4.2  Chlorine Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alterative release scenario (ARS) depicts a more likely release scenario that could occur compared to the WRS.  For WTP 3, the USAG evaluated the offsite impacts associated with the release of chlorine gas from a 1/16-inch-diameter pinhole leak in the valve on the chlorine container, a likely scenario, for a release time of 60 minutes.  This scenario was selected during the process hazard analysis (PHA) conducted for WTP 3.  Only one ARS was evaluated for WTP 3.  The chlorine release rate was calculated using EPA's RMP Comp&reg; model and used to evaluate the offsite impacts.\n\n\n\n5.0  Five-year Accident History\n\nNo chlorine releases have occurred at the USAG's WTP 3 during the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n6.0 RMP Document Management System\n\nA management system was established for the USAG's WTP 3 that attributes responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program and that meets the regulatory requirements in 40 CFR 68.15.  The management system documents the positions of the personnel responsible for implementing the Risk Management Program elements and defines the lines of authority through an organizational chart.  The Risk Management Program Team desinated in the USAG's WTP 3 RMP was assembled from a group of individuals, each with highly specialized expertise in one or many areas.  \n\n\n\n7.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe USAG's accident prevention program for WTP 3, which includes the chlorine process, consists of the 13 following elements that are summarized below.\n\n\n\n7.1  Process and Chemical Safety information\n\nThe process and chemical safety information includes comprehensive information pertain"
