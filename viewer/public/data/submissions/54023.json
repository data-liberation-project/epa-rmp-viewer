This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas Plant located near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma uses fractionation to separate ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from raw wellhead gas to produce marketable natural gas. As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g. methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso pentane, and n pentane). The Southern Dome plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) Risk Management Program regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA)"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plant that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of the accident prevention program. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that addresses process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include plant safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Safety Department, in conjunction with plant personnel, is assigned the responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A PSM and EHS Files list has been prepared to help employees readily locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, pressure) in the plant?s Operating Procedures. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documen"

This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas Plant primarily uses the HAZOP and What-if/Check list analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. OSHA and the EPA recognize these analysis techniques as an approved methodology for conducting PHAs. Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestion for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to company?s local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, are scheduled and resolved in a timely manner. All approved mitigations are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, Southern Dome Gas Plant?s Operating Procedures provide guidance on how to respond to process equipment operating outside their upper and lower limits. Operating Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Southern Dome Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a substantive change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical "

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of supporting personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nScissortail promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corr"

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigations reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Southern Dome Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Audit findings are forwarded to the company?s Safety Department for resolution. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in the audits. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit finding are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Southern Dome Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. \n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accidental release prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Southern Dome Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of saf"

Process relief valves that prevent vessel over pressurization.\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g. high temperature).\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems.\n2. Trained emergency response personnel.\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g. hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing).\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. The plant has not experienced any reportable accidents in this timeframe. Releases that did occur at the plant involving regulated substance were quickly contained and resulted in no deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Southern Dome Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency"

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Southern Dome Gas Plant processes or other Scissortail facilities. Personnel are informed of and trained in any changes to the emergency response plan.\n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Southern Dome Gas Plant is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Southern Dome Gas Plant has effective communications capability with appropriate the LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department). This communication provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Southern Dome Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills, and the gas plant provides refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nNone currently"
