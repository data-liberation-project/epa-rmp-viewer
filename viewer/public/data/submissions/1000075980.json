      "SummaryText": "The Mt. Storm Power Station is an electric utility generating facility owned by Virginia Electric & Power Company, which operates three coal boilers and one combustion turbine burning distillate oil  to generate electricity.  The facility uses Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in order to comply with nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission reductions required by U.S. EPA's Regional NOx SIP Call, as implemented through the West Virginia's NOx Budget Trading Program Rule 45CSR26 and EPA's Section 126 Rule.  The SCR process consists of injecting anhydrous ammonia into the boiler flue gas.  The gas then goes through a catalyst bed where the nitrogen oxides react to form nitrogen and water vapor.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of one hazardous material that is stored in a reportable quantity, anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nMt. Storm Power Station has maintained a strong safety and accidental release prevention program. Mt. Storm Power Station's operating procedures are written and followed with specific detail for safely conducting activities involving the unloading, storage, and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, each employee involved in operating the ammonia process is further trained in emergency operations.  Plant personnel strictly adhere to the written maintenance procedures to ensure the mechanical and functional integrity of the tank, and piping system.  These activities include periodic inspections, testing, and replacement of parts consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering practices.  Furthermore, Mt. Storm Power Station ensures that any changes to the ammonia process or plant equipment and systems are managed by implementing a hazard analysis, and safety procedures before modifications occur.  Mt. Storm Power Station has taken great care to ensure the anhydrous ammonia system is properly designed, maintained, and operated.
