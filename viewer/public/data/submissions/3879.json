The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of UAP Ag Service of Imperial, Nebraska, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\na) The facility has been owned and operated by UAP Pueblo since March 18, 1998.  All details and information concerning the plan are based on activities since that date.\n\nb) The primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia, is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to growers as a fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is recevied, stored and distributed to farmers for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nc) Currently, anhydrous ammonia is reacted with water and phosphoric acid to produce fertilizer.  This reaction, using a portable reactor under contract with reacting company, takes place during a few days each year.  There are plans to construct a permanent reactor on-site which may cause revisions to this and other safety and emergency plans.\n\nd) The maximum quantity stored in the largest storage tank is approximately 78,000 pounds.  This represents filling the largest storage tank to 85% of capacity.  There are two large storage tanks on site, along with a number of portable tank trailers used to deliver the anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is shipped to the facility either by bulk rail car or bulk truck.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\na) The worst-case scenario is ba"

The quantity released would equal approximately 150,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the storage tank filled to 85% of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 1.19 miles.\n\nb) The alternate case scenario is based on a release caused by a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would equal approximately 26,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm is 0.56 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\na) This facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI publication K-61.1, \"Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nb) This facility is in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nc) This facility follows the anhydrous ammonia standards established by the Nebraska State Fire Marshall, and is inspected by them on at least an annual basis.\n\nd) This facility is inspected on at least a monthly basis by employees knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\na) There have been no accidents in the previous five years involving the release of anhydrous ammonia at this facility, while under management of either UAP Pueblo or Koch Industries.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Plan\n\na) This facility has a written Emergency Response Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nb) This facility has provided State and Local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc) This facility has a written emergency response in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120, which includes pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluat"
