      "SummaryText": "The Limestone Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Plant is located at 7960 South Stateline Road, in Lowellville, Ohio. The Limestone Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Plant processes landfill gas (LFG - ~50% methane) from the nearby Republic Carbon Limestone Landfill and converts it to RNG (95-98% methane). This is done through a series of processes which include H2S removal, moisture removal, compression, CO2 removal, and N2 removal.\nThe Limestone regulated substances were inventoried against the RMP list. The only chemical that reaches the RMP threshold quantity is methane. For this release scenario, and since the methane is a gas and not liquid, the specific consequence evaluated was Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE). This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is the initial plan for the EDL Limestone Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Plant in Lowellville, Ohio. \nA HSEQ-Emergency Response Plan (ERP), Rev 4/06/2023, has been developed for Limestone. \n(b) Non-responding stationary source. Limestone employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated RMP substances and meet the requirements below: (68.90)\n(1) Limestone does not have regulated toxic substance(s) stored above the threshold quantity, so Limestone is not required to be included in the community emergency response plan. \n(2) Limestone only has regulated flammable substance(s) stored above the threshold quantity and has coordinated response actions with the local fire department. \n(3) Limestone has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. For each subpart in the ERP, Section 3, there are instructions regarding when and how to contact Emergency Services 911. \n(4) Limestone will perform annual emergency response coordination activities; and\n(5) Limestone will perform annual notification exercises. \nPrevention Program, Level 3 - The EDL Limestone facility is subject to Program Level 3 because it is not eligible for Program 1 and is subject to OSHA's PSM standard under federal"

In March 2009, EPA launched RMP*eSubmit, a Web-based system that allows facilities to securely submit and make corrections to their RMPs.
