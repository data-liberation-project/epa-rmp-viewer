ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nUnion Carbide Corporation has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We have implemented a combination of accident release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible Care( requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to employees, the public and the environment. Union Carbide management is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\n2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe facility is located at 19500 Mariner Avenue in the City of Torrance, California.  The Union Carbide Torrance Terminal activities include the bulk storage, transfer and blending of chemicals. Tank cars are temporarily stationed on-site for the unloading of bulk chemicals.  The Torrance Terminal is recognized as a covered source under the RMP rule as the facility maintains quantities of a regulated substance listed in the RMP rule.  Currently, the only regulated substance present on-site in quantities above the threshold limit is vinyl acetate monomer (VAM).\n\nAnnual VAM throughput is approximately 43 million pounds.  VAM is received by tank rail cars and stored in one aboveground tank dedicated for storage of VAM."

      "SummaryText": "  The tank description is summarized below:\n\n* Internal floating roof tank with primary and secondary rim seals;\n* 265,000-gallon capacity and 186,000-gallon maximum operating capacity;\n* Secondary containment with over 350,000-gallon capacity; and\n* Floating gauge for measuring liquid level.\n\nVAM is transferred via pipeline to the adjacent UCAR( Emulsion Systems (UES) latex manufacturing plant as needed or is shipped to customers via tank trucks.  Trucks are vented to a scrubber during loading to control the release of vapors.  If VAM is loaded directly from rail cars to trucks, a dedicated vapor balance system is used to reduce emissions to the atmosphere.\n\nA network of product transfer piping is routed between the VAM storage tank, the truck loading station and the adjacent UES latex plant.  All piping is coated to prevent corrosion and is supported by steel framework, which is securely fastened to concrete or asphalt platforms or foundations.  Underground sections of piping are encased by an outer pipe to prevent corrosion due to contact with soils.\n\n3.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that information be provided about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for VAM included an instantaneous release of all the contents of the VAM storage tank into the 93-foot by 98-foot by 5-foot concrete dike area, which acts as passive mitigation for the release.  This release translates to a release of 186,000 gallons (1,445,220 pounds) based on the maximum safe fill capacity.  According to EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) model, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  The following administrative control and passive mitigation measure "

      "SummaryText": "are used in this analysis:\n\nInventory Restriction:   Written operating procedures, which include an operating checklist, limit the maximum filling capacity of the VAM storage tank to 186,000 gallons, approximately 70%.  This tank is equipped with an automatic in-tank float gauge, which is read daily by an operator.  At this fill capacity, procedures require operations to stop all transfers into the tank.  \n\nConcrete Dike:  The dike contains and minimizes VAM evaporation to the atmosphere.\n\nSpecific systems to prevent this scenario from occurring, as well as mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n\nReaction Prevention:  Systems in place to ensure reactivity of material stored in tanks is inhibited.\n\nPressure Relief Systems:  Pressure relief systems help to ensure that over-pressures within tanks are mitigated.\n\nEquipment Design and Construction:  Design and construction codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n\nAlternative-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for VAM is a leaking valve, which is located in the dike area of the VAM storage tank.  The maximum offloading rate is 250 gallons per minute (1,943 pounds per minute) based on simultaneous offloading of two railcars.  This scenario leads to a 19,430-pound release of VAM in 10 minutes, the maximum time it may take an operator shut down the transfer pump.  The scenario assumes that the release is contained in the tank's dike area, which mitigates the release.  According to EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) model, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  The following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n\nEmergency Shutdown Systems:  A manual emergency shutdown system is designed to shut down the transfer pump.  \n\nSurveillance:  Operations personnel routinely monitor the process and facility perimeters.\n\n4.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nUnion Carbide keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date and available to operating personnel. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure and level control) in the Operational Safety Standard (OSS) documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, automated operating systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a means for establishing inspection and maintenance activities. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nUnion Carbide has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ens"

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for Union Carbide in Torrance is coordinated with the Torrance Fire Department (Administering Agency) and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Union Carbide conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the emergency response organizations.  In addition, Union Carbide's Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP) team located in Torrance responds to accidental releases from transportation incidents occurring in the continental U.S.\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Torrance Fire Department.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Union Carbide Torrance Terminal completes a thorough review of the affected VAM system(s) each time a design change is implemented and reviews the standard operating procedures at least every three years.  The Union Carbide audit team revalidates the process hazards analysis every five years from the date of the initial process hazards analysis.  Union Carbide is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems.  These on-going programs continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning t"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout - tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining/Certification Programs\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Union Carbide has implemented a comprehensive training and certification program for all employees involved in operating a process. After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified to work independently.  In addition, trained technical staff employees are available 24 hours a day to support operations.\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Union Carbide Torrance Terminal that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Union Carbide Torrance Terminal maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency respo"
