      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the regulated substance on site. Constructed in 1976, there have been no accidents or incidents to date. Two ton cylinders are kept on site, each in separate passive mitigation containment/process systems. Only one cylinder at a time is connected to the water system. Cylinders are transported to the site one at a time.\n\nThese process containment systems are leak tight and blast proof. No electricity or other mechanical devices are required for the containment systems to operate. A loss of electricity will close a valve and remove gas from the outlet lines. These two containment systems are stored in a building equipped with an automated chlorine leak detection system, security alarms, a surveillance system, and surrounded by a barbed wire fence. Cylinders are transported to the site one at a time. \n\nThe worst case scenario for the process would be if the gas line leaving the containment system of the active cylinder were damaged. If damaged, a maximum of approximately 0.0097 pounds of gas could be released. The release duration for a leak is approximately two seconds before the containment system's fail safe valve closes. The release time and quantity released is significantly less than the minimum one pound quantity that is required to be used for the worst case scenario.  \n\nThe handling and storage of each cylinder is considered a separate process. The failure of one process will not affect the process of the other. The nature of the containment process system is such that if the cylinder should catastrophically fail, operations can continue until the cylinder has drained and gas will not be released to the environment. This effectively allows this location to be below the threshold for RMP requirements.\n\nThe graphic includes a USGS map with 0.1 mile circled around the site.  There are no public receptors within the 0.1 mile of the offsite consequence analysis.\n\nThis report supersedes the previous submission made in June 1999."
