All safety equipment and procedures required for handling anhydrous ammonia will be implemented to minimize any risks involved.\nThis storage facility is located in a rural agricultural area on a commercial grain and livestock farm with limited exposure to surrounding homes and people. The closest home is on the farm building site where the tank is located and is approximately 500 feet northwest of the storage facility. This home is used as an office/meeting room for Tuholski Farms Inc. There are two other homes that are approximately 1100 feet to the north and 1600 feet to the northwest. Other risks are cattle facilities which are 250 to 400 feet north of the storage tank. The closest building is about 30 feet north of this tank from which electrical power is supplied for this tank.\n Emergency phone numbers are as follows -  All emergency situations ( 911 ), National Response Center ( 1-800-424-8802 ) Indiana Department of Enviromental Management ( 1-888-233-7745 ) La Porte Hospital ( 219-326-1234)"
