It is the intent of the Doraville Terminal to incorporate the most recent procedural guidance (NFPA #58-2011, API 510, API 570) to the extent feasible. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the DeKalb County Fire Rescue Department as well as the DeKalb County EMA. Medical emergencies will require notification of the local emergency medical services (\"Emergency Medical Services\") and Northside Hospital. This facility trains its employees to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Motiva Enterprises LLC - Doraville Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility comprised of  adjoined South, East and West Terminals that includes butane blending operations. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and one butane storage vessel located at the East Terminal.\n\n\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's butane storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The facility's alternate (with potential off-site impact) release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" accident and associated fireball.\n\n\n\nThe Motiva Enterprises LLC - Doraville Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) inclusive of the 14 required elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

Additionally, the DeKalb County Fire Rescue Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion, if feasible.  As this is a \"new\" system, there have been no accidents or incidents resulting in a significant release and subsequent death, injury, evacuation or sheltering-in-place.\n\n"
