Facility Policy.\n\n\n\n        The owners, management and employees of Art's Milling Service, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, HOWARD County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.     Facility Information.\n\n\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to area farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, store and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  At times, Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on site in nurse tanks designed for this purpose.  The facility is manned year round during normal business hours.\n\n\n\n3.    This facility has developed a Worst-Case Release Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenario however; it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by the EPA. \n\n\n\n         An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\n\n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries o"
