This Risk Management Program addresses all the requirements of the NJDEP, OSHA, and EPA regulations, as well as company policies. Our policy is to protect the community and our workers from accidental releases of chemical substances by training and retaining skilled workers and implementing design, operational and maintenance controls and procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the extent and impact of a release.\n\nProcedures have been adopted which govern how engineering, operations, inspection, maintenance, training, accident investigation, and modifications are conducted.  These procedures are an integral part of the Risk Management Program and of the refining facility routine operation.  In the event of an accidental release of a hazardous substance, our personnel are trained to respond, contain the release and mitigate the consequences of the release.\n\nIn 1999 the Refining Facility received a commendation from the Mayor of Woodbridge Township for the participation in the Woodbridge Community Advisory Panel and for the ongoing dialog with the community.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY\n\nThe Amerada Hess Corporation Refining Facility is located at 750 Cliff Road in Port Reading, New Jersey.  The facility is located on approximately 210 acres, and is in an industrial/commercial area, with the nearest residential locations to the west.  The refining facility was refurbished and commissioned in 1985 based on State of the Art Technology available at that time.  All subsequent modifications were designed with the best available technology consistent with our Risk Management Program.  This facility is designed to catalytically crack heavy vacuum gas oil and residual oils using a fluid catalytic process to ma"

There are also task auditors assigned to review the elements.  There is a RMP Manager who has overall responsibility for the program and reports directly to the Refinery Manager.\n\nThe  elements of the RMP are as follows:\n\nEmployee Participation:  This facility has trained and dedicated employees who are encouraged to make suggestions that reduce risks in this facility through our safety committee, through participation in process hazard analysis, and in developing and improving procedures.\n\nProcess Safety Information:  This facility has developed and updates process safety information that is used to develop operating limits and in the hazard analysis of the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  This facility has conducted process hazard analysis using the HAZOP technique  on all covered processes and revalidates the process hazard analyses on a five year schedule.  The HAZOP technique looks at what can go wrong in a process, what the consequences are, and what safeguards are in place.  If the hazard analysis team determines additional safeguards are needed, then they submit recommendations.  In addition, any modifications that are made to the process are also subject to a hazard analysis to assure the ongoing safety of the facility.  All recommendations identified by the hazard analysis team are  addressed.\n\nOperating"

These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  In addition, key process parameters are identified in procedures that provide guidance on how to respond to \"upper\" and \"lower\" limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.   This information , along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks\n\nTraining:  This facility has developed a comprehensive training program to document and verify that the operators understand the tasks they are required to perform.  This includes basic training for new employees, and classroom and on the job training for specific operating jobs.  Verification of the training is through written tests, demonstrations, and trainer observations.  Refresher training is required for all operators at least every three years.  Refresher training is required for any operator that has not performed a job within a year.\n\nContractors:  This facility requires that the contractors perform their tasks safely and understand the safe work practices that must  be followed.  Contractors and visitors receive an orientation covering our Emergency Response Plan, an overview of the processes in the facility, requirements for HAZWOPER awareness level, and various facility procedures.  Their entrance, presence, and exit from the facility are controlled.  All work perfor"

The Preventive Maintenance (PM) program provides for the inspection and testing of all pertinent equipment in the facility.  Internal and external inspections of process vessels, service of pressure safety devices, and testing of safety controls and interlocks are performed on stream, when practical, and during planned turnarounds.  Piping and remaining equipment are tested and serviced regularly in accordance with industry practice and manufacturers' recommendations. A written description of the Preventive Maintenance Program has been developed detailing the functions of the program.  Documentation of preventive maintenance and testing is maintained in the computerized Maintenance Management System program software and in the Maintenance Department's files.  A tabulation of scheduled versus performed preventative maintenance is reviewed annually.\n\nSafe Work Practices:  This facility has a comprehensive Hot Work Procedure that all personnel including must follow.
