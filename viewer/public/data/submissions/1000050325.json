SE Tylose strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility. SE Tylose also strives to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. The facility has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the process at this facility. One part of these systems is the risk management program which helps manage the risks at the facility and complies with the requirements of the EPA's Rule 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at the facility. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nSE Tylose's goal at its Program 3 stationary source is accidental release prevention while maintaining emergency response procedures to minimize consequences in the event of any such release. SE Tylose maintains a Process Safety Manual directing employees to process safety information in accordance with respective Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management and EPA chemical accident prevention provisions. SE Tylose also maintains an Emergency Procedures Manual providing necessary information and guidelines to utilize in the event of an emergency situation resulting in accidental release of a regulated substance. SE Tylose's objective is to train employees and contractors in emergency response procedures, and requires that emergency response actions are supported by proper consideration for safety, health, and welfare of employees, contractors, the surrounding community, and property.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nSE Tylose has developed a management system to oversee implementation"

Within this program, the existing covered process and potential future processes are systematically examined.\r\n\r\nSE Tylose primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance, and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\r\n\r\nSE Tylose periodically updates its PHAs of affected units. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nSE Tylose maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.

New employees receive basic training in SE Tylose operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\nSE Tylose uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, SE Tylose has procedures in place to provide that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform SE Tylose personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work.

This review provides that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to corroborate that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\n\r\nSE Tylose uses established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
