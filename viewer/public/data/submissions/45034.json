However, because it is a new startup, actual operations may be delayed due to \n\nunforeseen equipment failures upon initial startup.  Agave Energy Company purchased the Duke Dagger \n\nDraw Gas Plant in May 2005 and will combine operations with the existing Agave Gas Plant to operate as \n\nthe Agave Dagger Draw Gas Plant. Since this is a new Agave facility, there is no accident history to \n\nreport.\n\n\n\nThe operation of the Agave Dagger Draw Gas Plant is intended to process 40 MMSCFD of gas.  The gas \n\nwill be treated to remove acid gas components, dehydrated to remove water and processed to remove \n\nheavy (liquid) hydrocarbons from the gas stream.  Several plant systems will be involved to perform these \n\nfunctions.  The acid gas that is removed by the amine unit will be disposed of by either acid gas injection \n\ninto a disposal well or by incinerating in a flare.  The preferred method of disposal will be to compress the \n\ngas and inject it into the well.  Under emergency situations, the gas will be flared to prevent the emission \n\nof lethal hydrogen sulfide to atmosphere.  The cryogenic unit is designed to liquefy natural gas liquids \n\nfrom the sweet, dehydrated inlet gas by removing work (heat) from the gas be means of the turbo \n\nexpander. The cryogenic unit recovers natural gas liquids (NGL) by cooling the gas stream to extremely \n\ncold temperatures (-130?F) and condensing components such as ethane, propane, butanes and heavier.  It \n\nis the presence of these flammable NGL that cause the facility to be subject to the OSHA PSM process \n\nand thus the RMP process.\n\n\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumed that the unit with the largest amount of NGL (cryo unit 1) had \n\neither a catastrophic failure (worse case scenario) or a small leak (alternative scenario).  The flammable \n\nmaterial is composed of a mixture of methane, ethane, "

For both the worse case and alternative scenario, the mixture was assumed to be composed \n\nentirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage, i.e. highest heat of combustion or pooling \n\nfactor.\n\n\n\nThe Agave Dagger Draw Gas Plant is an OSHA PSM facility and as such is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\nIn addition, the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.120 (HazWhoper), 29 CFR 1910.38 (EAP), 29 CFR \n\n1910.146 (confined spaces), 29 CFR 1910.1200 (hazard communications), 29 CFR 1910.252 (hot work), \n\nand 29 CFR 1910.147 (lock out/tag out).  Specific practices that are important to Agave?s prevention \n\nprogram include a rigorous maintenance program, ongoing safety training, compliance audits, incident \n\ninvestigation, written operating procedures, and process hazard analysis.\n\n\n\nAgave Energy Company has provided onsite tours of the facility to local fire and rescue departments.  \n\nAgave has also provided such entities with a written emergency action plan.  Facility personnel are \n\ntrained in several aspects of emergency response including the proper use of facility SCBA?s, fire \n\nextinguishers, and H2S safety.  It is Agave?s intent that regularly scheduled drills be held to ensure that \n\nthe facility personnel are aware to the emergency action plan.  In addition, the emergency response plan \n\nwill be reviewed semi-annual with facility personnel and appropriate changes made.  \n\n\n\nAgave is committed to the exploration and production of oil and gas. Our corporate objectives are to \n\ncontinually increase our reserves while minimizing our costs, preventing significant impact to the \n\nenvironment, and protecting the health and safety of employees and the public.\n\n\n\nAgave is committed to complying with all existing and relevant safety and environmental laws and \n\nregulations.
