Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental =\n\npart of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to =\n\napplicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate =\n\ncontrols to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an =\n\naccidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in =\n\naccordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with =\n\nthe local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and =\n\nother authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the =\n\nimpact of the release to employees, the environment and the general =\n\npublic.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary =\n\nactivity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, =\n\nhandling and mixing of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  =\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, mixed and distributed for direct =\n\napplication as crop production nutrients.  The maximum stored quantity =\n\nof anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 230,000 pounds =\n\nstored in one (1) 18,000 gallon storage tank and two (2) 12,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum fill level of =\n\nthe tank is 85% of the total tank capacity.  This facility is loaded by =\n\ntransport truck, therefore the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia =\n\nhandled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill =\n\nlevel of 85%.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific =\n\nPrevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release =\n\nprevention requirements and applicable State and local codes"

All plans and =\n\nprocedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by =\n\nfacility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety =\n\nData Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used =\n\nto build and operate the anhydrous ammonia equipment are maintained at =\n\nthe facility.\n\n\n\n2) Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards =\n\nassociated with the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The =\n\nreviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human =\n\nerrors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to =\n\ncontrol hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or =\n\nmonitor releases.  The results of the reviews are documented and =\n\nproblems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n3) Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written operating =\n\nprocedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The =\n\nprocedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and =\n\nHealth Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910, 111, \"Storage and =\n\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the American National Standards =\n\nInstitute (ANS) standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and =\n\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\".  The written procedures are =\n\nreviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as =\n\nnecessary.\n\n\n\n4) Training:  All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous =\n\nammonia participate in a training program."

Storage and transfer/process equipment =\n\ninspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate =\n\nannual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures =\n\nfollow either instructions furnished by the equipment vendors, Federal =\n\nor State regulations (i.e., the provisions of the OSHA standard, 29 CFR =\n\n1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\") or industry codes =\n\n(i.e., the provisions of the ANSI standard, \"Safety Requirements for the =\n\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\")  The written =\n\nprocedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and =\n\nrevised as necessary.\n\n\n\n6) Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits =\n\nwill be performed at least once every three (3) years.
