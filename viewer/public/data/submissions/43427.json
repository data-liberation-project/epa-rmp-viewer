The =\r\nreviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human =\r\nerrors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to =\r\ncontrol hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or =\r\nmonitor releases.

Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental =\r\npart of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to =\r\napplicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate =\r\ncontrols to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an =\r\naccidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in =\r\naccordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with =\r\nthe local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and =\r\nother authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the =\r\nimpact of the release to employees, the environment and the general =\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary =\r\nactivity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, =\r\nhandling and mixing of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  =\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, mixed and distributed for direct =\r\napplication as crop production nutrients.  The maximum stored quantity =\r\nof anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 230,000 pounds =\r\nstored in one (1) 18,000 gallon storage tank and two (2) 12,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum fill level of =\r\nthe tank is 85% of the total tank capacity.  This facility is loaded by =\r\ntransport truck, therefore the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia =\r\nhandled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill =\r\nlevel of 85%.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific =\r\nPrevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release =\r\nprevention requirements and applicable State and local codes"
