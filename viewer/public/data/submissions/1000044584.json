As an inherent part of the December 2013 Triennial RMP Compliance Audit, the SCR systems and programs were reviewed by an experienced multi-disciplinary team of AES Redondo Beach personnel (operations, environmental, engineering and maintenance), facilitated by a HazOp-experienced ESCI EnviroServices, Inc. licensed Professional Engineer (who completed the Audit).  It was verified that no changes (except in-kind replacements) to equipment and no changes to procedures had been made since the previous system and program review.  Additionally, there were no additional hazards or consequences identified, no necessary or significant recommendations, and no change to any off-site consequence analysis (no change to worst case or alternative case release scenarios). \r\n2. The list of recommendations previously made in the 2009 RMP submittal and 2010 Compliance Audit were verified to have been implemented.\r\n3. The current off-site consequence analysis (worst case and alternative case release scenarios) were evaluated in detail and found to be still valid and representative, and no change in impact, distance, or receptors have been identified.

The RMP was prepared in compliance with both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  This resubmittal includes an updated narrative description (in this Executive Summary) of the AES Redondo Beach aqueous ammonia accident prevention program, the data elements required by the most recent USEPA RMP regulations, and represents a thorough review of operating and maintenance procedures, and a review of the process hazard analyses previously conducted.     \r\n\r\nAs documented in the Offsite Consequence Analysis prepared for the 2001 RMP revision, the additional SCR system installed for Unit 5 & 6 did not result in an increase of the offsite consequence analysis (OCA) impact distance for ammonia, the hazardous substance of concern, from the original June 1999 RMP.  Therefore, in accordance with USEPA regulations at Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68, at 40 CFR 68.190(b)(4), an RMP update filing with the USEPA was not required since the OCA impact distance did not change by more than a factor of two. The California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.10 also does not require a filing of an updated RMP under the CalARP Program if the OCA impact distance does not change by more than a factor of two unless the process modification is considered significant.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to maintain a fully accurate and up to date facility RMP, in late 2001 AES Redondo Beach repor"

The detectors are wired to a local ammonia monitor and alarm panel which will also annunciate to control room operators via the plant distributed control system (DCS).   A safety shower is available in each tank area and at the metering pump skids.\r\n\r\nThe control system includes an electronic DCS with Interlocks incorporated which shut off aqueous ammonia flow to the SCR system in case of low boiler load below 130 MW, low gas temperature in the boiler below 350F, low SCR fan flue gas flow less than 4,000 scfm, boiler fuel trip or aqueous ammonia tank pump failure.\r\n\r\nAES Redondo Beach ensures ongoing mechanical and process integrity of equipment by incorporating manufacturers' maintenance, inspection, and testing procedures in the applicable facility operational and maintenance procedures, as determined appropriate.\r\n\r\nUnits 5 and 6\r\nAES uses a 29.4 percent aqueous ammonia solution for the SCR system on Units 5 and 6.  Aqueous ammonia for this SCR system is stored in one aboveground carbon steel ammonia storage tank.  The tank is horizontal, and has a nominal capacity of 20,000 U.S. gallons.  The tank is capable of withstanding pressures of 25 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), which is designed for the worst-case ambient temperature conditions of 125 degrees Fahrenheit.  The storage tank is an ASME-registered U-stamped pressure vessel designed for ammonia service.  To minimize potential ammonia leakage, the tank utilizes a double-wall design.  The inner-wall space is isolated from the main storage space and can be drained independent of the main storage area.\r\n\r\nThe tank is placed within a concrete berm.  The berm has a design capacity of 110 percent of the tank volume, which accounts for 6.5 inches (over 24 hours) cumulative rainfall for a 25-year frequency storm.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia storage tank is fill"

The fill line allows the transfer of aqueous ammonia from the delivery truck to the tank, while the vapor return line allows the displaced ammonia vapors form the tank to be returned to the truck.  To retain a closed system and minimize potential leakage, the loading system incorporates both liquid fill hoses and vapor return hoses.  Upon completion of filing operations, all lines are purged with compressed air prior to being disconnected. The fill and vapor return piping is securely anchored at the truck unloading station.  The unloading station is within the spill containment barrier that runs along the perimeter of the tank.  The tank has a visual level gauge in the vicinity of the loading station to assist the unloading truck operator and to prevent overfilling.  A ground cable is provided for connection to the unloading truck.

The aqueous ammonia for Units 7 and 8 is stored in a 20,000-gallon double-walled underground storage tank; the aqueous ammonia for Units 5 and 6 is stored in one aboveground, double-walled tank with a containment berm.  Both installations feature a bermed tank loading area which is connected to a subsurface emergency containment sump.  Aqueous ammonia is one of several hazardous materials used at the facility that are critical to the safe and continued generation of electricity for the community.  As AES Redondo Beach utilizes aqueous ammonia over the federal 10,000 pound RMP threshold, the facility and the SCR process are covered under the federal and state Risk Management Prevention program. \r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE:  WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nSeveral potential release scenarios were evaluated as part of the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA).  The OCA was performed in accordance with USEPA and California CalARP OCA guidance.  The results of this OCA, which included worst case and alternative release scenarios, were considered in the implementation of the prevention program and in facility emergency planning.  The results of the facility's Process Hazard Review was used to determine the most likely (e.g. credible) alternative case release scenario based on operations and system design and maintenance.  The specific details and results of the RMP are maintained by the facility and have been reviewed with local emergency response and planning agencies (primarily the Redondo Beach Fire Department).  The administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each scenario are summarized in this RMP submittal.

The AES Redondo Beach, LLC facility is located in the northwestern corner of the City of Redondo Beach, California.  SCE retained the electrical transmission facilities (e.g. the switchyards and power distribution lines).\r\n\r\nThe AES Redondo Beach, LLC power generating facility burns natural gas in boilers to produce steam. The steam is used in turbine generators to produce electricity. Currently, the station actively operates four primary boiler/steam turbine generating units, designated Units 5, 6, 7, and 8. Units 5 and 6 are operated from a common control room and are rated at 175 megawatts (MW) each.  Units 7 & 8 are operated from a common control room and are rated at 480 MW each.  \r\n\r\nThe basic flow path of each boiler is as follows:  (1) combustion air is supplied by fans to the air preheater where it is heated, (2) the heated air is mixed with fuel in burners to produce a flame and hot flue gases (combustion products), (3) the hot flue gases flow through the radiant and then convective passes of the boiler, (4) heat is removed from the flue gas as it flows over the outside of tubes in the boiler, (5) water flowing in the inside of the tubes is converted to steam as this heat is absorbed, (6) the flue gas flows through the air preheater where a final increment of heat is removed in preheating the incoming combustion air,"

A team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise conducts the analyses. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \r\n\r\nThe PHA teams findings are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from original design safety features, AES Redondo Beach, as part of the five year resubmittal process, reviews (and if necessary) updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

The amount of NOx that the station is allowed to emit is regulated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).  In 1991 - 1992, the SCAQMD revised its Rule 1135 which reduced the allowed NOx emissions and specifically required that SCE (the previous owner of the generating station) install a NOx emission reduction system on the two largest boilers - Units 7 and 8.  In 1993 - 1994, SCE installed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) NOx Control System on Units 7 and 8, which are operated from a common control room.  Identical SCR systems were designed and installed by the same firm, Noell, Inc., at several Southern California SCE generating stations.   \r\n\r\nIn December 2001, AES completed installation of an additional SCR system within the existing boilers of Units 5 and 6 to further reduce NOx emissions from the AES Redondo Beach, LLC facility.

Safety equipment associated with the ammonia systems (eye wash/shower, respirator protection, etc.) is also routinely inspected as part of the facility's ongoing existing occupational safety programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, AES Redondo Beach periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the risk management and accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  This audit reviews each of the USEPA-required prevention program elements to ensure that they are up-to-date and are being implemented an"

Compliance audits are conducted by a team lead by AES compliance personnel assisted by an outside RMP compliance auditing consultant.  AES Redondo Beach operations, maintenance and engineering personnel also participate in the audit.  An RMP compliance audit checklist is used during the audit.  The last audit (which included the RMP) was performed in December 2013 with the audit report issued to facility management for development and implementation of any corrective action by July 2014.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\nA primary tool used by AES Redondo Beach to identify the contributing factor(s) responsible for accidents, incidents, occupational illnesses, or unusual hazardous events is a thorough and properly completed incident / accident investigation.  The incident investigation will attempt to focus on root causes or contributing factors associated with an accident or incident.  From these findings, corrective action will be initiated as necessary to reduce the potential for recurrence.  The incident investigation procedures used are an existing, integral part of the AES Redondo Beach Safety and Injury and Illness Prevention Program. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify causal factors and root causes, and then develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The incident investigation procedures in effect at AES Redondo Beach are contained in the AES Redondo Beach Safety Manual and the Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nThe investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in re"
