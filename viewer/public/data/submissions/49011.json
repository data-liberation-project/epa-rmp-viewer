      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe City of Dallas Water Utilities maintains a policy of safe water and wastewater treatment plant operation, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the treatment processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, their employees, and the environment. They cooperate with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote effective contingency planning in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs.\n\nAs part of this policy, Dallas Water Utilities maintains compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (USEPA) regulations for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances under section 112? of the Clean Air Act.   Facilities covered by the regulations (40 CFR 68) are required to implement a risk management program and submit a description of the program (called a risk management plan, or RMP) to USEPA.  \n\nThe Bachman Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage and use of chlorine and ammonia.  The amounts stored for both chemicals exceed the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  \n\nDallas Water Utilities first submitted a RMP for the Bachman WTP to USEPA in 1999.  RMPs must be updated and resubmitted to USEPA every five (5) years.  Consequently, the RMP for the Bachman WTP was updated and resubmitted to USEPA in 2004.  \n\nRMPs must also be updated and resubmitted due to any change that requires a revised hazard review or a revised off-site consequence analysis.  The Bachman WTP recently started using Ozone as a disinfection process, installed new chlorine feed equipment, and improved the ammonia feed process by adding a separate Ammonia Building, increasing the stored ammonia quantity and installing a new ammonia feed system . These changes required a revised hazard review and a revised off-site consequence a"

      "SummaryText": "nalysis. The following information summarizes the Bachman WTP 2007 update and resubmission:\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Bachman Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine combined with ammonia to disinfect water.  The plant receives raw water from Lake Grapevine and Lake Lewisville, by way of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped into the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.\n\n1. Chlorine\nDuring 2006-2007, the Bachman WTP completely replaced an older chlorine feed system by installing a new system.  The Bachman WTP has a maximum storage quantity of 205 tons of chlorine at its facility.  The chlorine is stored in two Department of Transportation certified 90-ton rail cars and a 30-ton emergency storage tank, which is only filled with 25 tons due to administrative controls.  The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA\n \nThe majority of chlorine is delivered to the Bachman WTP in the rail cars by railroad on rail spurs.  A chlorine tanker truck supplies chlorine for the emergency tank, when necessary.  The rail cars and the tank are located inside the Chlorine Building.  \n\nThe chlorine feed facilities at the Bachman WTP now consist of the storage tanks (two 90-ton rail cars and one 30-ton emergency tank); liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves; leak detectors and alarms; evaporators; gas piping and miscellaneous valves; chlorinators; injectors, solution piping, valves, and diffusers; plant water piping and valves; and a scrubber system.  A release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area or at the chlorine process areas.\n\n \n2. Ammonia\nDuring 2006-2007, the Bachman WTP added a separate Ammonia Building, increased the stored ammonia quantity and installed a new ammonia feed system.  The Bachman WTP maximum storage quantity is now 51.5 tons of ammonia (anhydrous) at its facility.  The ammonia is stored in two 10,000 gallo"

A release of ammonia gas could potentially occur at the ammonia storage area or at the ammonia process areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nIn August 2006, Dallas Water Utilities and Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. updated the offsite consequence analyses at Bachman WTP.   The results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.  Any changes resulting from this review are reported in this resubmission.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Bachman WTP was reviewed for the period from June 2002 through June 2007.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Dallas Water Utilities maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of chlorine and ammonia at Bachman WTP.  The program consists of seven elements:\n\n1.    Safety Information\nDallas Water Utilities has maintained information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment as part of their risk management program at Bachman WTP.  The information is made available to employees and contractors at Bachman WTP who will work in the chlorine and ammonia process area.  Emergency response planners can also use the information to develop training programs and procedures.\n\n2. Hazard Review\nA hazard re"

      "SummaryText": "view of chlorine and ammonia processes and procedures is conducted at least every five (5) years to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases, or whenever there are changes that require a new hazard review.  A revised chlorine and ammonia hazard review using the ?What-If? method was conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. with the assistance of Bachman WTP plant management and staff familiar with the process? operation and maintenance in May, 2006.  Potential changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the chlorine and ammonia systems were identified and have been implemented, or will be in the future.\n\nIn addition, the new Ozone Disinfection Process and its impact on the chlorine and ammonia processes, if any was reviewed. Individual Ozone Disinfection Process components including, Vacuum Swing Adsorption (VSA) system used for oxygen generation, liquid oxygen delivery and storage, ozone generation, ozone feed and ozone destruction processes were examined to identify their impact on chlorine and ammonia processes.\nDuring the Hazard Review Workshop it was determined that the Ozone Disinfection Process has no impact on the covered processes (chlorine and ammonia) except the reduction of the amounts of chlorine and ammonia used when the ozone process is online.\n\n3. Operating procedures\nDallas Water Utilities have developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide instructions and step for conducting activities associated with the chlorine and ammonia processes at Bachman WTP consistent with the safety information. Bachman WTP operating procedures include startup, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n4. T"

Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure Bachman WTP staff understands and adheres to current operating procedures.  \n\nIn 2006, operating procedures were reviewed and ?Documentation of On-the-Job Training and Competency in Covered Process Operating Procedures? forms were developed for each covered process, and individual competency in the operating procedures will be documented  \n\n5. Maintenance\nBachman WTP has developed and implemented a preventive and corrective maintenance program to ensure equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and ammonia is functioning properly and installed to minimize the risk of releases.   The program addresses equipment testing, inspection, and preventive maintenance schedules, and documentation of equipment testing, inspection, and preventive and corrective maintenance activities. \n\n6. Compliance audits\nUSEPA?s risk management rule requires that Bachman WTP complete a compliance audit for its risk management program at least once every 3 years. The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to verify compliance with risk management rule requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety or program deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase safety awareness among Bachman WTP staff.\n\nMalcolm Pirnie, Inc., with the assistance of Bachman WTP plant management and staff familiar with the processes operation and maintenance, conducted an audit as part of the Risk Management Plan update in 2004.

Incident Investigation\nBachman WTP management investigates each incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine or ammonia. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. \n\nAn incident investigation team will be established following criteria established in the Bachman WTP risk management program.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, additional training and competency requirements), to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed for Bachman WTP, which provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia to ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  These procedures include leak investigation, operational-level response activities, and communications to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Dallas Fire Department HAZMAT Team, in the event of an emergency. \n\nIn 2005-2006, the Dallas Water Utilities updated and incorporated the ERP, as well as sections of the risk management program, into an ?all-hazard? integrated contingency plan (ICP).  The ICP format will minimize duplication in the preparation and use of emergency response and risk management plans for various regulatory requirements, and will eliminate confusion for Bachman WTP staff that may have to decide which plan applies to a particular emergency.\n\nIn 2006"

A facility wide safety inspection should be performed prior to the next RMP submission update in 2009. \n\n2. Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance should be re-evaluated and revised."
