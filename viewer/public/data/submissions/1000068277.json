Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nKinder Morgan Production Company LP (Kinder Morgan) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  Kinder Morgan's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to effectively control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nII.    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Tract 75 NGL Plant (Tract 75) in the Yates Field Unit, located near Iraan, Texas, extracts natural-gas liquids from natural gas.  The plant contains regulated flammable substances above the threshold.  The plant does not have any regulated toxic substances with an amount greater than the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68. \n\n\n\n\n\nIII.    General Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program in place at Tract 75 is summarized in the following.  Because this facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n    A.    Employee Participation\n\n\n\n    Kinder Morgan ensures its employees participate in all development, review and implementation aspects of PSM and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include compiling and updating technical documents, chemical information and operating procedures; participating in and providing suggestions on the emergency response dri"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant.\n\n\n\n    B.    Process Safety Information\n\n\n\n    Kinder Morgan personnel maintain a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes.  These documents address hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals at the plant, process technology, and process equipment.  Specific personnel within the gas plant and at the Midland Region office are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A PSM information reference form is utilized to document the location of this information.\n\n\n\n    \n\n    C.    Training\n\n\n\n    To complement the written procedures for process operations, Kinder Morgan has implemented a comprehensive and effective training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  The program, including initial training, refresher training and documentation, is intended to help employees understand the nature and problems arising from process operations and increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to a process.  Each new employee and each employee operating a newly assigned process is trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures for the unit.  The training includes emphasis on the safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job assignment.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least once every three years.  All of this training is documented"

Emergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nKinder Morgan has developed and implemented a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance potentially resulting from a fire or explosion, severe weather, environmental spill,or pipeline failure.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post incident cleanup, reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on factors such as modifications made to the plant process or operating procedures, or a change in the communication procedures.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is coordinated with the local emergency response and government officials.  The facility has round-the-clock communication capability with appropriate local emergency planning committee (LEPC) officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to meetings with the LEPC, the facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the local community and emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\n"
