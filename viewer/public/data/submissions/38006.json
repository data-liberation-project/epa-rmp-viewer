Lime stabilization is the treatment process used to treat the water.  The facility was constructed and is operated according to applicable federal, state, and industry standards.    \n\n\n\nThe Aurora Water Treatment Plant is dedicated to safe disinfection of the City?s water supply.  The City utilized chlorine gas liquefied under pressure as its disinfectant agent until October, 2002.  At that time, the City initiated operation of its sodium hypochlorite system for disinfection.  The City currently operates both disinfection systems and has reduced the amount of chlorine stored on site proportionately.\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls are in-place to limit the amount of chlorine stored at the facility to that which is necessary to accommodate seasonal fluctuations in chlorine demand.  In the event of an accidental release, personnel are directed to contact the Hazardous Materials Team of the Aurora Fire Department.  The Water Treatment Plant is included in the Fire Department?s Emergency Response Plan.  The Fire Department drills regularly at the facility to maintain a working familiarity with the facility and emergency procedures.\n\n\n\nThe US EPA Off-site Consequences Analysis Guidance was used to determine the off-site effects of an accidental release.  In the facility?s worst-case scenario, a one-ton chlorine cylinder would be damaged outside the building enclosure, and the rupture would be large enough that the entire contents would empty within ten minutes.  The off-site impact of such a scenario would reach as far as 1.3 miles from the facility.\n\n\n\nSince the probability of such a large release is extremely low, an alternate release scenario was also modeled.  This scenario involves rupture of a liquid chlorine line.  This release would empty a one-ton cylinder in 23 minutes.  The building enclosure was considered as mit"

Again using the US EPA Off-Site Consequences Analysis Guidance, the impact of this release would reach 0.25 miles from the facility.\n\n\n\nPersonnel who work with the chlorine equipment are trained in safe operating procedures.  Chlorine equipment is inspected and receives preventative maintenance per the manufacturer?s specifications.  Chlorine gas monitors are installed wherever chlorine gas has the potential to escape, and each alarm is dealt with swiftly and carefully according to facility procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Aurora Water Treatment Plant has had one reportable accident with the last five years.  On March 6, 2000, six hundred (600) pounds of chlorine was released.  This incident did not cause any injury or property damage.  The facility continues to train its employees in safe handling and operations practices, and the Aurora Fire Department drills regularly at the plant.\n\n"
