We have documented training and on the job training. We have an accident/near miss policy to stop any recurrences before they become accidents. We have developed LOTO, hot work, confined space programs to ensure employee safety. We have done not only classroom but plant specific training. Everyone in the plant has participated including all management personnel.  Everyone here, especially management, is dedicated to making Center Ethanol a zero recordable plant. We include documented monthly safety talks and safety committees. Safety issues are addressed immediately. All of our SOP's are reviewed and signed off on before any new policy is put into place. We have a management committee that reviews our policies from a safety perspective. Our facility is located in the town of Sauget, Illinois. We are an ethonol manufacturing plant with nameplate of 54 mgy. We use aqueous ammonia, 20% caustic soda for cleaning purposes, sulfuric acid for Ph control. Our denaturant is not determined as of yet due to the fact that our plant is not up and running. A notification to the EPA as to the denaturant will be sent out as soon as applicable as well as for the start up of our boilers. We are a dry mill facility. The corn is ground and put into a slurry. It then goes to liquifaction for residence time to prepare the slurry for fermentation. All of our pressure vessels and boilers have been inspected by the state fire marshall's office. Once fermentation is complete, the beer mash is then sent to distillation. Once most of the alcohol is removed, the vapors are then sent to dehydration to remove the final existing water. Once evaporation has taken place, the final product is sent to strorage tanks. It is then blended with the denaturant and sent to the final tanks before being loaded out into tanker trucks and railcars.\nOur facil"

      "SummaryText": "ity has developed an Emergency Response Plan that will be sent to the local LEPC. We have been in close contact with the local fire department and have arranged tours for all of the firemen to familiarize them with our facility. We have a foam system and monitors located by our ethanol storage and denaturant tanks and also in our distillation areas. We have developed a PSM program and trained all employees on our program. We are training a group of employees on Hazwoper, First Responder and incident commander requirements. We will do monthly fire drills once we are up and running and practice our emergency evacuation procedures. We have been in contact with the National Fire and Safety Institute to develop site specific ethanol training and this will be done in conjunction with the local fire department also. All of our maintenance and operations personnel have been vendor specific trained on all of the in house equipment. We had outside training done on forklifts, man lifts and scissors lift equipment.\nWe have no accident history as we are not yet operational.\nWe employ a management of change policy to review perodically our equipment and systems to determine if we can improve on methods and safety. We will review our existing policies on a yearly basis as required by OSHA. All new employees must go through safety training before they can begin working in the plant. The same applies to any contractors we will employ in the future.\nCenter Ethanol Company is comprised of a diversified group of people all focused on safety. We start each day with a safety talk that all employees are involved in. Any near miss or accident is posted and reviewed with all employees. Center Ethanol will be a recordable free company now and in the future."
