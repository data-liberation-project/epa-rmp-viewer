      "SummaryText": "The primary purpose of the Hot Springs Wastewater Treatment Plant is to treat wastewater and return it to the environment.  Parts of this process utilize chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in individual one-ton cylinders and stored until needed.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are injected into the wastewater treatment system by automatic feeders.  The feed system uses a \"scrubber\" which is designed to automatically contain and neutralize chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases through a vacuum process and eventual exposure to sodium hydroxide(50% caustic soda) if a leak occurs.The maximum amount of chlorine stored at the facility is 16,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide stored at this facility is 16,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nThe prevention of unnecessary human exposure reduces the threat to the health and safety of employees as well as to nearby members of the community.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThis wastewater treatment facility complies with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State of Arkansas codes and regulations.  Furthermore, the facility has stringent guidelines and practices for day to day procedures involving the chemicals.  These procedures have been updated to include recommendations by the EPA, such as \"Consequences of Deviation.\"\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program was developed for the City of Hot Springs and the surrounding areas with the assistance of Affiliated Engineers, Inc.  This program has been discussed with the Arkansas Office of Emergency Preparedness and the Hot Springs Fire Department.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the appropriate agencies and potentially affected members of the community.  In addition, it provides procedures for mitigating any releases that may cause harm to the community.\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenari"

Defective parts were replaced the next day and re-training was completed with this operator."
