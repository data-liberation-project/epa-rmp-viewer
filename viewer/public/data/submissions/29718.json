Part of this project called for the establishment of a new centrally located chlorination facility for the city water system. This was constructed and planced in operation in August of 1998. This facility consists of chlorine storage shed capable of stroing four one ton cylinders. Two of these clyinders are connected at all times to chlorinators one of which is active and one on standby. These chlorinators draw gaseous chlorine from the cylinders and transport it though piping to chlorine ejectors where it is mixed with water and injected in the influent flow line to the ground storage tank.\n\nWe have compiled the safety information on the plant(as the law requires). This consist of all the specifications, codes and standards used in the materials and construction of the plant. Also all the information on the chlorine or any other chemicals used in the treatment plant.\n\nWe have done a Safety Review of the safety procedures at the plant(as the law requires). This consist of review ofall the procedures to be used in case of an accident or spill of hazardous materials. Also the policys and procedures that will be employed in case of any type of emergency.\n\nWe have established operating prodcdures at the plant(as the law requires). This consist of a complete set of policys and procedures that will be employed in case of any type of emergency.\n\nWe have continued to provide training at the plant(as the law requires). Louisiana Rural Water Association School, Safe chlorine Handling Schools, Louisiana Conference on Water Supply, Sewerage and Industrial Waste, Inc. schools for certification requirements (at least 40 hours per 2 years).\n\nWe preform the necessary maintenance to the plant(as the law requires) and as directed by the operation and maintenance manuals addressed in the section of operation procedures.\n\nWe conduit complance audits of ourselves(as the law requires) on"
