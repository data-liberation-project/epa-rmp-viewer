This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the NGL transloading and storage system. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nOxy Levelland Terminal Company, LLC covered process is the equipment and piping associated with the NGL transloading and storage system located at 565 Gusher Road in Levelland, TX.  The regulated substances are isobutane and pentane. The main operation is described below: \n\nNGLs are received through a pipeline into bullet style storage tanks. Pumps are used to push the NGLs out of the storage tanks and into railcars.  Railcars and storage tanks can also be loaded by truck.\n\nNo reactions or conversion are taking place at Oxy Levelland Terminal Company, LLC, therefore no process chemistry is in order and does not need to be accounted for.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 1,900,000 pounds of pentane, and 920,000 pounds of isobutane.    \n\n\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: One worst-case analysis has been defined for the covered process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment report, which is included as part of the RMP documentation.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: One alternative case release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment, which is included as part of the RMP documentation.  \n\n\n\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\n\nAlthough the storage and use of pentane and iso-butane has inherent potential risks and the worst-case release scenario can potentially reach the community, Oxy Levelland Terminal Company, LLC has recognized these potential risks and "

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a release of a regulated substance:\n\n?    The system has alarms.\n\n?    The system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\n?    Detection is in place to notify individuals if a leak occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of the implementation of this Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Oxy Levelland Terminal Company, LLC to manage process safety issues associated with the use of pentane and iso-butane.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Hot Work Permit\n\n?    Contractors\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases within the last five years.\n\n"
