This inspection produced several improvement suggestions that we are currently implementing. We have also modified our preventative maintenance program, and created a hoist maintenance SOP to improve on our regular hoist maintenance. The inspection results and the regular hoist maintenance documentation is maintained on our web site for the operators to review.\r\n\r\nApril 12, 2019 Tri-State Tool Hoist company inspected the chlorine cylinder hoist. The inspection recommended we monitor the rail because it is showing signs of wear and recommended a new trolley and wheels due to the drive gear wearing on the bean from the extreme curve in the rail that the hoist travels on. \r\n\r\n\tChlorination System Preventative Maintenance\r\nWe have created detailed PowerPoint presentations as our SOP's for our preventative maintenance procedures for the chlorination system. These include instructions for the complete rebuilding of chlorine regulators, piping inspections, chlorine sensors and alarm systems. All of this information is available to all the operators through the plant wide web site, including a complete history of all the preventative maintenance that has been scheduled and completed. These procedures have been reviewed yearly by the operators and we have made revisions to keep them current."

Personnel at the plant are given training regarding the response procedures and refreshers are completed periodically during the plant safety meetings. \r\n\r\nIn April 9, 2007, Oct 24, 2011, and June 24, 2017 the local fire department conducted a mock emergency training exercise involving plant personnel at the wastewater treatment plant. The mock emergency was designed to simulate a major chlorine leak scenario. Special attention was given to our major leak SOP. We followed the steps outlined and made necessary modifications. These efforts along with safety operating procedures already in place will minimize the possibility for leaks and minimize response times in the event a leak does occur. This will result in a safe working environment and the protection of the local community. \r\n\r\n\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOn September 6, 2006 we had a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) meeting where we identified that the changing of the cylinders produced the greatest potential hazard of a release of chlorine gas. Four separate hazards were identified by the team. \r\n\r\nStarting on October 17th 2012 we held one PHA meeting including all the personnel for each shift. We used a checklist to start discussion for each meeting and solicited ideas about the chlorination system. Each shift finished the check sheet and added the discussion items. A spreadsheet was created to provide a list of job assignments to answer all the potential questions about our chlorination system. Each shift Supervisor was assigned to answer and resolve these tasks. There were 36 questions that were answered or resolved by January 10, 2013.\r\n\t\r\nStarting on October 17th 2017 we held one PHA meeting including all the personnel for each shift.

The zone of influence used for the worst case scenario was a 1.3 mile radius of the treatment plant. \r\n\r\nModeling for the alternative release scenario was also conducted using the RMP*Comp software. This scenario assumes a wind speed of 6.7 mph and a temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit during a loss of the entire contents of a full tank (2000lbs). The variables that we entered into the RMP* Comp program included a one square inch hole, a tank pressure of 130 psi, and the tank temperature was 92 degrees Fahrenheit, which was the most recent highest recorded temperature for our area. This program indicated the estimated distance to Toxic Endpoint is 0.3 miles. The estimated toxic endpoint concentration is 0.0087 mg/l. The zone of influence used for the alternative case scenario was a 0.3 mile radius of the treatment plant.\r\n\r\nMARPLOT was used to map the affected area surrounding the treatment plant. On the map the population effected within the 1.3 and 0.3 mile radius was added; the population was from the 2010 US census data. It was determined that the alternate release affected a population of 10 in the 0.3 mile radius and the worst case affected a population of 545 in the 1.3 mile radius. \r\n\r\n\tFive-Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no chlorine related accidents or incidents reported in the last five years.\r\n\r\n\tEmergency Response Program and Planned Improvements \r\nAs indicated previously, Medina County has collaborated with the LEPC to develop a release response program.

This document and all information is accessible on a plant wide web site that can be obtained by all personnel on any given day. All procedures have been continually revised by using the Process Hazard Analysis Procedures.  \r\n\r\nThe Liverpool Wastewater Treatment Plant Administration along with the Medina County Sanitary Engineers Safety Coordinator and County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), have developed a spill response document known as the Chlorine Spill Investigative/Response Procedure. This document provides step-by-step instruction regarding steps to be taken when responding to a chlorine leak. In 2006, 2011 and 2017 an internal worse case scenario SOP was created in conjunction with The Valley City Fire Department to train emergency response and plant personnel. \r\n\r\n\tWorst Case/Alternate Release Scenario \r\nAs part of this plan, a worst case and a more likely alternative release scenario has been documented. The worst-case release scenario calls for the release of the entire content of one cylinder in ten minutes. The cylinders are constructed of one-inch thick steel with recessed fill/discharge valves making the possibility of the loss of the entire contents of one tank within this time period remote. The alternative release is considered to be a more likely scenario of how a release would occur. In this scenario we have considered that a pipe has broken or a valve has failed leaving a one square inch hole from which the chlorine can escape. The plant alarm has sounded but it has taken 10 minutes for an operator or the fire department to don their SCBA and HAZMAT suit and enter the building and secure the leak. \r\n\r\nModeling for the worst scenario was conducted using the RMP*Comp software. This scenario assumed a wind speed of 3.4 mph and a temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit during a loss of the entire contents of a full tank (2000lbs). This program indicated the"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\tOverview \r\nThe Liverpool Wastewater Treatment Plant is a 15 million gallon per day facility that removes pollutants from municipal sewage prior to discharging the clean water to the West Branch of the Rocky River. As a last step in the treatment of the wastewater, chlorine is added to kill any remaining bacteria. The chlorine used in this process is purchased in one-ton cylinders. Typically eight (8) cylinders are stored in a chlorination building specifically designed for this purpose. Three (3) of the cylinders are in use and connected to the chlorination system while five (5) are waiting to be used. All cylinders are contained in a concrete block building with a pre-cast concrete roof to minimize any possibility of fire in the building. Fire alarms have been installed and have been connected to the plant wide computer system. The cylinders are stored on appropriate concrete saddles on a concrete floor. No other materials are stored in the building. A wind sock has been installed on top of the building to determine the wind direction. A chlorine leak detection alarm and chlorine detector levels are displayed on a plant wide computer system. The system is maintained and checked on a routine basis in accordance with plant internal preventative maintenance program.  \r\n\r\n\tChlorine Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies \r\nThe Administration at the Liverpool Wastewater Treatment Plant; in conjunction with plant operators, chlorine supplier, and The Valley City Fire Department have developed standard operating procedures (SOP's) for the handling of the chlorination facilities. These procedures outline in detail how cylinders are connected to the chlorine feed system, the number of personnel (including observers) to be involved in the changing of the cylinders, the frequency at which chlorine piping and valves are to be replaced, etc. All operators are trained to know the SOP's and this training is reviewed yearly and during yearly safety"
