      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nThe Yakima Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is one of the facilities owned and operated by the City of\nYakima. The WWTP has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the EPA and OSHA\nregulatory requirements. A brief overview of the RMP and the associated policies at this facility is described\nbelow:\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe City takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are properly\ntrained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals. The City has\nalso established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and response. These are reviewed with\nemployees on a periodical basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur. To increase\nemployee safety and awareness, the City:\n?maintains up-to-date safety information and operating procedures\n?performs regular preventative maintenance,\n?provides periodic refresher training on safe handling of chemicals, and\n?conducts periodic safety drills.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\nThe WWTP disinfects wastewater from residential, commercial, and industrial sources through a series of\nphysical, chemical, and biological treatment operations that include:\n?preliminary treatment,\n?primary sedimentation,\n?activated sludge for carbonaceous BOD removal,\n?nitrification and denitrification,\n?secondary sedimentation,\n?filtration\n?chlorination, and dechlorination\nThe regulated substances handled at the WWTP are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Each chemical is stored in 1-\nton (2,000 lbs) containers, with a maximum of 16 chlorine containers and 6 sulfur dioxide containers stored onsite.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and\nconsideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility. The EPA's software program RMP*Comp was\nused to model both release scenarios and determine the r"

      "SummaryText": "adius of impact.\nIn the worst-case release scenario, the regulation clearly states the release quantity shall be the contents of the\nsingle largest vessel of the covered process chemical, at ground level and under very stable atmospheric\nconditions. These conditions are most likely to result in a cloud of the released chemical remaining intact as it\nslowly moves along the ground. Planning for an accidental release under these unlikely conditions provides the\nCity with additional safety margin in protecting the public.\n\nAs required by regulation, the worst-case scenario for chlorine assumed the complete release of chlorine from a\nsingle container (2,000 lbs). Similarly, the worst-case scenario for sulfur dioxide assumed the complete release\nof chemical from a single container (2,000 lbs). In addition, no mitigation effects, such as a release inside a\nstorage building, were considered for either chemical.\n\nFor the alternative release scenario for chlorine, the assumptions were that (a) a failure occurred in the ton\ncontainer valve, and (b) 1,200 lbs were released over a 60- minute period before the leak could be repaired.\nThe passive mitigation effect of the storage building reduces the amount of chlorine released to the atmosphere\nby 55% (from 1,200 lbs to 660 lbs).\n\nFor the alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide, the assumptions were that (a) a failure occurred in the ton\ncontainer safety device, and (b) 400 lbs of sulfur dioxide were released over a 60- minute period before the leak\ncould be repaired. No mitigation effects, such as a release inside the sulfur dioxide storage building, were\nconsidered.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide\nThe prevention program fulfills the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the\nEPA RMP rule, and includes:\n?formal and on-the-job training,\n?written operating procedures, and\n?a process equipment preventive maintenance program.\n\nAccident History\nThere has been no release of either co"

      "SummaryText": "vered chemical in the past five years\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe WTTP has established and maintains an emergency action plan that is coordinated with local response\nagencies. The goals of the program are to protect on-site employees from the hazardous effects of a release\nand to minimize the effects of releases on the general public. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to\nreflect personnel and regulatory changes\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee meetings that focus on\nsafety issues are held regularly at the facility. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and\npresent ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of this RMP document, process hazard analyses of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide\nsystems was conducted with key employees to fulfill the prevention program requirements. During these\nsessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical\nreleases. Each recommendation will be or has been considered for implementation. In addition, the exercise\nprovided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes. Future plans are to utilize other disinfection methods and eliminate the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide for that purpose."
