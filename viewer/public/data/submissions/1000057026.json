High pressure gas from field wells is sent to a gas plant whereby NGL liquids are extracted and stored in three 60,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks operating at approximately 200 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nThis facility is aware of the requirements in the areas of Safety, Hazard Reviews, written Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigations.  To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance\" has been prepared and implemented in conjunction with the Risk Management Plans  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced an accident as defined in the regulation within the past five years.\n\n\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
