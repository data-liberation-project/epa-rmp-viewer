      "SummaryText": "    Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Oshkosh Wastewater Treatment Plant uses gaseous chlorine for disinfection of the City's drinking water. Chlorine is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The City of Oshkosh is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is important to an accidental release prevention program that includes areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorine storage and feed processes at our facility. It is our policy to comply with applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends on the safe handling procedures that we use combined with the safety devices included in the design of this facility and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nIf a release of chlorine should occur, the City has coordinated with the Oshkosh Emergency dispatcher and in turn the Oshkosh Fire Department and Emergency Operations Coordinator, who will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of an unforeseen release.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Oshkosh Wastewater Treatment Plant uses one regulated substance, gaseous chlorine, at the facility. Chlorine is a toxic gas stored under pressure as a liquid.  This substance is used to disinfect the City's drinking water.  \n\n\n\nThe average inventory of chlorine at our facility is nine (9) - 2,000 pound (1-ton) tanks, for a total of 18,000 pounds (9-tons).  \n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Oshkosh Wastewater Treatment Plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule requirements as specified in 40 CFR 68 and OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Rule as specified in 29 CFR 1910.119. The chlorine cylinders "

The Wastewater Treatment Plant operators are competent in the chlorine system operations and are trained in the hazards and operating procedures associated with the process.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Oshkosh Wastewater Treatment Plant went on-line in December 1975.  Since going on-line, no documented accidental releases have occurred.   \n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nEmergency Response by the Oshkosh Wastewater Treatment Plant employees will be limited to incidental releases only. The plant has coordinated emergency response actions with the City of Oshkosh Fire Department and the emergency dispatcher. The Wastewater Treatment Plant's Emergency Response Plan is studied, practiced, and updated as needed. \n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe City of Oshkosh uses a continual improvement process to improve safety and minimize risks of release.  The process includes periodic review of the RMP, operating procedures, training content and the Hazards Review.  Modifications to these entities are documented as appropriate.\n\n"
