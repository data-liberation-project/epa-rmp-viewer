Lexington\nLocation:    10601 Highway 224\nContact:    Steve Kaullen\nPhone:    660-259-2261\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Anhydrous Ammonia Plant near Lexington are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Lexington Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the buying and selling of grain and the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nThis plan is developed utilizing the possibility of receiving multiple railcars for product at one time. The facility has one-12,000 gallon storage tank, 2-18,000 gallon storage tanks and 1-30,000 gallon storage tank and 45-1,000 gallon nurse tanks for product distribution.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1, 1981?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia?.\n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nOn October 31, 2007 at approximately 17:50 hours a hydrostatic relief valve failed resulting in the release of approximately 357.5 pounds. There were no deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor have there been any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage in the past five years.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with the OSHA "
