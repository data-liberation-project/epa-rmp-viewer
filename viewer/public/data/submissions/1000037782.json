The five covered processes include:\r\n\r\no\tCovered Process 1: Railcar Storage\r\no\tCovered Process 2: Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Handling\r\no\tCovered Process 3: Ammonium Polyphosphate Reacting\r\no\tCovered Process 4: Aqua Ammonia Reacting\r\no\tCovered Process 5: Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling\r\n\r\nThe PNC receives anhydrous ammonia by railcar and NH3 Semi Trucks and stores the anhydrous ammonia in one of two stationary storage tanks.  From the stationary storage tanks, the anhydrous ammonia may be transferred to NH3 Field Delivery  \r\nTruck(s) for transportation to the client location, or may be transferred to the Ammonium Polyphosphate Reacting (Covered Process 3) and the Aqua Ammonia Reacting (Covered Process 4) for the blending of ammonium polyphosphate or aqua ammonia.  Because the aqua ammonia is greater than 20% concentration, the storage and handling of the aqua ammonia is also covered under the PSM/RMPr.  TMC trains all of its Process Operators and Maintenance Personnel in the relevant operating and maintenance procedures provided in the PSM/RMPr.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the total quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the Facility is 1,152,448 lbs.  The total quantity that RMP Submit calculates is high because Covered Processes 3 and 4 have no actual storage but are connected to the stationary storage tanks whose quantity is included in the 1,152,448 lbs.  Thus the quantity in the storage tanks is counted 3 times rather than only one time as it should be.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for all five covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of The McGregor Company (TMC) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR \u00a768.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations in Colfax, WA.  At this Facility, TMC engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use TMC's products to support agricultural operations.  \r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia from the Plant Nutrient Center (PNC) located approximately 4 miles west of Colfax, WA at 28232 Endicott Road Colfax, WA 99111.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the PNC to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that PNC has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nTMC is submitting this plan as a Resubmission of all applicable sections of the RMP.  Based on its analysis, TMC has revised this RMP to reflect 5 covered processes and has changed the RMP Program Level from 2 to 3.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility PSM/RMPr.\r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Operations at the PNC Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling, manufacturing, retail sale and distribution.  As related to the PSM/RMPr, the PNC Facility stores and handles two covered chemicals (anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia) at quantities that exceed the threshold"

      "SummaryText": "release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes (1) the failure to fully close a vapor valve on a railcar (Covered Process 1), (2) rupture of a transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation (Covered Processes 2 and 5), and (3) release of anhydrous ammonia from process piping (Covered Processes 3 and 4).  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, emergency shutoff valves, and check valves) and operating procedures that TMC uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe PNC Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The PNC Manager is assisted by other trained TMC staff, as directed.  The PNC Manager is responsible for ensuring that TMC Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nTMC's PNC is a non-responding facility. TMC has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the PNC.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by The McGregor Company at the PNC complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).
