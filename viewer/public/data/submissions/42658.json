Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the House of Raeford Farms, Inc Distribution Center of Raeford, N.C. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at out facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass Poultry Processing. We have 1 regulated substance present at our Raeford  facility.. These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous), Ammonia (anhydrous ) is used for our refrigeration system.\n\n3.    The Worst Case release Scenario (s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite s\\consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA?s RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or  Equations. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from \nAmmonia Refrigeration. In this scenario 35,000lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.\nThe toxic  liquid releases is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 100% of the capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 ms wind speed, the maximum distance of 3.37 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) invo"

The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures(s) are taken into account to calculate , having the effect of restraints. The release is also assumed to be controlled by the emergency shutdown systems(s). These active mitigation systems have the effect of minimizing the loss. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles. \n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Distribution Center has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following section briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that  is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nHouse of Raeford Farms, Inc.Distribution Center in Raeford  maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined). The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with engineering and process operations and are validated at an interval of bi annually. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on June , 2003.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activ"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Distribution Center has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every 2 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Distribution Center carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by the checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at House of Raeford Farms, Inc, Distribution Center in Raeford  to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 06-12-2002. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular "
