The 50/50 joint venture was formed on April 1, 1996 to consolidate the elastomer resources, production facilities, technical expertise, and business skills from both companies.  Globally, DuPont Dow Elastomers offers a wide variety of products ranging from thermoset rubber polymers used in the general rubber industry to high-performance fluoroelastomers used by the chemical processing and automotive industries. These products are used in a wide range of applications, including:\n\n7 Coatings - from rainwear to liners for roofs and tanks,\n7 Automotive products - from power steering pressure hoses to high performance timing belts,\n7 Wire and cable insulation - from electrical wiring to nuclear power station cable, and\n7 Industrial application - from microwave door enclosures to acid hoses.  \n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires certain companies, like ours, to share information about the chemicals we use, the potential risks those chemicals pose to the community, the ways that we manage these risks, and the plans we have made to respond to a possible release of these chemicals.  This requirement is part of the Congress's Clean Air Act known as the Risk Management Planning (RMP) rule.  This executive summary is provided in compliance with 40 CFR ' 68.155 of the RMP rule.\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDupont Dow Elastomers Beaumont Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We follow a corporate philosophy that the \"goal is zero.\"  This means we constantly strive for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  We have programs, procedures and management practices in place to supp"

We constantly assess our progress against this goal of zero and take corrective actions to get back on track whenever necessary.\n\nOur primary focus is on prevention of any accidental releases.  However, we have strong emergency response capabilities to back-up our prevention activities.  We use this combination of prevention programs and emergency response capability to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. \nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\no A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program   \n   regulation;\no A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental \n   chemical releases;\no An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\no An overview of our emergency response program;\no A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\no An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from \n   occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment;\no The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide; and\no The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program.\n\n\nSite Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nThe DuPont Dow Elastomers Beaumont Plant is part of a larger site called the Beaumont Industrial Park.  This industrial park is located on Highway 347 in Beaumont, Texas. Our facilities at the Beaumont Industrial Park presently employ 380 people who live and work in Jefferson County and vicinity.  The two manufacturing facilities located at the site have been in operation since 1957, producing high performance products, such as, Hypalon. and Nordel. specialty elastomers.  \n\nDuPont Dow Elastomers Beaumont Plant, which was formerly opera"

The long life and diversity of our operations means we have vast experience in operating processes in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:\nChlorine, Chloroform and Sulfur Dioxide  \n\nFlammables: \n1,3-Butadiene and Propylene\n\nOther chemicals are used in our processes at the Beaumont plant, but pose a lesser risk to the community, because they are not stored in large quantities, are less hazardous, and are not listed in the RMP regulations.   These chemicals include: carbon tetrachloride, dibasic aluminum alkyl, ethylene, hexane, hydrogen, sulfuryl chloride, vanadium oxytrichloride and vanadium tetrachloride.\n\nKey Off-Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nTo help with understanding the potential impact on the community due to a release of chemicals from DuPont Dow Elastomers Beaumont Plant, we have provided information about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facilities.   \n\nThese scenarios were developed using the guidance and technical data supplied by the EPA.  Scenario information similar to that described below has been used for many years as part of our process safety management program.  In the past we have modeled potential releases and analyzed the results to help us continuously improve our processes and reduce risk.  We continue to do these assessments as part of our internal process safety management systems.\n\nThe EPA defines the worst case scenario as a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated chemical.  The scenario assumes the entire quantity is released in ten minutes, even if it is impossible to do so.\n\nUsing the methods described by the EPA, the worst case release of a flammable chemical from the DuPont Dow"

      "SummaryText": " Elastomers Beaumont Plant would be the release of the entire contents of our 1,3-butadiene storage tank (180,000 pounds) in a 10-minute period.  The scenario assumes the cloud would ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of the released material.  The pressure wave generated from the explosion would travel about 2112 feet out from the tank.  Because of the tank location on the site, the pressure wave would only extend off site by about 1112 feet into an area without public receptors.   This event would not be expected to expose the public to the amount of pressure of concern to the EPA, but an explosion like this would be heard and possibly felt off the Industrial Park site.\n\nAlso using the methods described by the EPA, the worst case toxic scenario is the release of the entire contents of a sulfur dioxide railcar (180,000 pounds) in a 10-minute period.  Using EPA guidelines, a release like this could impact the public 16 miles from the point of the release.  Depending on the wind direction at the time of the release, most of Jefferson County and parts of Orange County could be affected.  \n\nThe worst case scenarios described above underscore the need for very rigorous process safety management systems.  It is important to note however, that none of the prevention and mitigation equipment, practices, and procedures that have been put in place by DuPont Dow Elastomers to prevent or respond to releases such as these are taken into account for these worst case scenarios.  \n\nSince the worst case scenarios are so very improbable, they are not good cases to focus on for emergency response planning with the local community.   In order to facilitate emergency response planning with the community, the EPA has included the requirement for companies to report alternate case scenarios.  These alternate case scenarios provide a more realistic picture of what could actually happen if the safety systems used by a facility were to fail.\n\nThe EPA requires that companies includ"

This is because the impact of a flammable scenario on the public is expected to be similar for all the different types of flammables.   The toxic chemicals can vary in their effects and so must be reviewed individually.  In the data elements section of this report you will find a detailed description of all these alternate release scenarios.\n\nThe alternate case for flammables at the DuPont Dow Elastomers Beaumont Plant is the release of 1,3-butadiene from a process area.  In this scenario, 600 pounds of flammable gas is released and ignited, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario has an impact distance of about 211 feet and does not extend off-site.  Of course, we still have accident prevention activities in place to protect our employees and third parties from injury.\n\nThe largest and most significant toxic alternate case scenario for DuPont Dow Elastomers Beaumont Plant is a large leak of chlorine from instrument tubing, a flange gasket, or a leaking valve.  This could result in over 1,000 pounds of chlorine released into the atmosphere.  Under normal weather conditions, this release could go 1056 feet before the toxic concentration falls below the level of concern.  Because of the process location, this release would not leave the Beaumont Industrial Park site.   Although it would impact our employees or others inside the Industrial Park boundaries, it would not impact areas where the public has access.\n\nKnowing the impact of a release like this, DuPont Dow Elastomers has many things in place to prevent releases from ever occurring.

These guidelines address the following:\n\n7 Activation of the Emergency Response Plan;\n7 Notification of affected personnel both on and off-site;\n7 Notification of appropriate regulatory agencies;\n7 Escape and evacuation plans and practices for affected personnel;\n7 Personnel Accounting;\n7 Rescue Operations and medical assistance.\n\nTo ensure prompt and efficient implementation of these plans, emergency drills are conducted at appropriate frequencies.  These drills include participation of local emergency response organizations.   All personnel with assigned responsibilities in these plans receive special training, including initial and refresher training to fulfill the competency requirements of their specific function within the plan.\n\nThe Beaumont Industrial Park Master Disaster Plan provides guidelines for handing a major emergency or disaster at the site to minimize hazards to site personnel and neighboring communities.  The DuPont Dow Elastomers Area Plans serve as a supplement to this Plan.  The safety of plant personnel and neighbors will take precedence over all other considerations in these plans.\n\nThe Beaumont Industrial Park operates the SAFER.
