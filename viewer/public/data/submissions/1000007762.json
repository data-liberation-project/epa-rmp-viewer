(Plumrose USA) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to release of Ammonia (anhydrous) are documented in the Risk Management Program (RMP) document. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs will be fully implemented by Plumrose USA personnel and contractors and are coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts. \n\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nPlumrose USA provides employment for approximately 425 workers in Booneville, Mississippi. This facility is a meat processing plant owned by Danish Crown, Randers, Denmark. The corporate headquarters are at Plumrose USA, Inc., 7 Lexington Avenue, East Brunswick, New Jersey 08816.\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. Plumrose USA receives meat products that have been processed off-site and slices the products for packaging. From the time the meat products are received and throughout the processes conducted, the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing an Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulation.\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess Safety Information: Plumrose USA will complete a compilation of written process safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The PHA will be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Ammonia refrigeration process. This process"
