More importantly, our employees have been trained in\ntheir respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual\nresponsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia\nThe Garden City Co-op, Inc. maintains and operates their NH3 plant in strict accordance with all State and\nLocal authorities. The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply\nwith their requests for improvement. Changes or improvements in the facilityA\u00c2\u00bfs equipment will be acted\nupon immediately following the enforcement agency (KDA's) request, or as found to be necessary by our\nmaintenance staff.\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site specific operating procedures, plant maintenance and\nthe employees are competency tested over the training material. Each employee uses goggles and gloves\nduring ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of emergency safety water during nurse tank\nloading operations.\nWith the above mentioned training in mind, it makes it very easy to report that absolutely no injury accidents\nor property damage has occurred at this facility for the past five years.\nOur Emergency Action Plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public and the\narea First Responders.
