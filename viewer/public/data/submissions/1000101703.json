      "SummaryText": "gency Response Plan (ERP) describes measures developed and implemented at MTW for recognizing and responding to emergency conditions that may arise at the plant. These measures have been developed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from events that may arise during facility operations, including fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials to air, soil, or surface water. MTW's ERP has been developed to facilitate the rapid, orderly assembly of plant personnel and to activate trained Emergency Response personnel to assist in personnel rescue and controlling and containing an emergency condition on-site.\n \nThe provisions of the ERP and its supporting procedures have been developed to provide an appropriate means of detection and response for multiple industrial incidents and natural disasters, including those described in the MTW Risk Management Plan and the Honeywell Safety Demonstration Report for Renewal of Source Materials License SUB-526. This plan is intended to be fully consistent with the multiple regulatory requirements that apply to activities at the plant, including 10 CFR 40.31(j) and 29 CFR 1910.120(q). The MTW maintains a separate RCRA Contingency Plan that has been developed to implement the requirements of 40 CFR 264 and related regulations. The provisions of the RCRA Contingency Plan augment and complement the provisions of the ERP.\n \nThe ERP addresses the following subjects:\n- Pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside agencies\n- Personnel roles, lines of authority, training and communication\n- Emergency prevention, recognition, and classification\n- Safe distances and places of refuge\n- Site security and control\n- Evacuation routes and procedures\n- Decontamination\n- Emergency medical treatment and first aid\n- Emergency alerting and response procedures\n- Personal protective equipment and emergency equipment\n- Critique, debrief, and follow-up procedures\n \nNotification of Public Of"

Two tank cars may be connected to the system, but generally only one is actively supplying anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at any one time.  Only 7 tank cars can be within the plant fence line at any one time.  Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used in the manufacture of fluorine gas and the conversion of uranium dioxide (UO2) to uranium tetrafluoride (UF4).\n \n- Aqueous Ammonia (AqNH3, 29% Conc)\nAqueous ammonia is stored in the tank farm facility in a storage vessel.  The storage tank can hold an administrative maximum inventory of approximately 99,641 lbs of AqNH3.   Ammonia is used in the Wet Process operational area as a reactant for recovering uranium from scrubbing solutions in order to feed the material back into the UF6 process.\n \n3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n \nThe general accident prevention for a Program 3 RMP facility is very comprehensive, consisting of twelve elements. These elements are part of Occupational Safety and Health Act - Process Safety Management Regulations (OSHA 1910.119). The general accident prevention elements are as follows.\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-Startup Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Work Permits\n- Contractors\n \nMTW uses its Management of Change (MOC) process to assure plant compliance with many of the elements of OSHA 1910.119.
