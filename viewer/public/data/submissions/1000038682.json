      "SummaryText": "Two chlorine evaporation systems are fed liquid chlorine from 2000 pound cylinders and each system feeds gaseous chlorine to an aluminum furnace.  The gaseous chlorine is injected into a molten aluminum pump and reacts with magnesium impurity to refine the aluminum.  The Chlorine Building can house up to 8 one-ton chlorine cylinders at a time.  In case of a chlorine leak the building can be manually vented to the plant air pollution control system for dilution, some neutralization with lime, and dispersal from a stack. The first system has operated safely for over 25 years and the second system over 19 years.  Both systems have operated without any  offsite consequences.  The facility has an emergency response team on site and drills annually.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nState Metal Industries policy is to comply with all applicable rules and regulations including OSHA Process Safety Management, EPA Accidental Risk Prevention and New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act.  The chlorine system and procedures are based on recommendations of the Chlorine Institute.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nIn addition to the requirements of EPA (40CFR68) and OSHA PSM (29CFR1910.119), State Metal Industries has been covered by New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act regulations(Title 7 NJAC Chapter 31) for over fifteen years.  All systems and procedures are based on Chlorine Institute recommendations to insure safe operation.  Chlorine sensors and an alarm system with both local alarms and a connection to an alarm monitoring company warn of a chlorine leak in the Chlorine Building to facilitate rapid emergency response.  An annual audit of all aspects of the RMP program, including preventive maintenance and emergency response, is conducted.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine in the last five years and no offsite consequences ever."

The site coordinators are trained to contact the Camden Fire Department (911), Camden City LEPC, NJ DEP and the National Response Center as appropriate.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nThe Risk Management Program at State Metal Industries is a mature program that has undergone more than 25 years of continual improvements.  No major planned changes are presently contemplated.  Management remains open to any practical equipment or procedures that will improve safety."
