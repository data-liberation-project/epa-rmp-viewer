This facility will be operated with the same proffesionalism and concern for the community and enviromnet as our other facilities.\n\n1.  Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n     The management and employees of Corn Belt FS, Inc. - Moweaqua Facility are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, \nthe facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any \nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n     The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distibuted for direct application as a crop nutrient.  \nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management \npersonnel, and authorized contractors.  The maximum quanity of anhydrous ammonia that can\nbe stored at the facility would be 168235 pounds, this would include nurse tanks normally stored\n there.\n\n3.  The accidental release program.\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes \nand regulations.  This facility has implimented the provision of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage & \nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as\nadopted by the state regulation and standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4.   Five-year accident history.\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the pasat five years that:\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries"
