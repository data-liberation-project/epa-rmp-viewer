At this facility, anhydrous ammonia is the only chemical which exceeds the specified threshold quantities requiring compliance with the above regulations. \nJBS USA is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community, including protecting the environment. The intent of the JBS Hyrum Beef facility\u0092s accidental release prevention program (a.k.a., PSM/RMP programs) is to minimize all risks which could lead to an accidental ammonia release, and to minimize the consequences of such a release when it does occur. This program includes an emphasis on maintaining ammonia-related equipment and piping in good condition, as well as operating it safely. The facility\u0092s safety programs help to prevent accidents by focusing on rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment. Safety rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA standards for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120) and Emergency Action Plans (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38). This program includes an emergency response notification plan, emergency response drills and drill evaluations. This emergency response plan is coordinated with the local"

      "SummaryText": "fire department. Facility management  ensures that employees are trained to respond properly to a chemical emergency.\nIn past several years, significant improvements have been made to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release. Decades-old vessels, compressors and piping have been decommissioned along with their two machine rooms, while the remaining South Engine Room has been upgraded to ensure full compliance with current safety standards and best practices, as well as to meet expected refrigeration capacity needs.\n\nAn additional improvement made in recent years by all JBS USA facilities subject to these regulations, including this facility, was the implementation of the web-based, APSM compliance software suite. APSM is a key part of this facility\u0092s implementation program of PSM/RMP compliance, accomplished, in part, by providing prompts to the facility to complete periodic tasks, self-audits and audit findings, and by facilitating coordination of such with corporate PSM management. Through ongoing implementation of the PSM/RMP programs, this facility continuously seeks ways to improve the safety of our ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nRegarding accidental ammonia releases significant enough to meet the EPA criteria of a five-year accident history, in the past five years, the JBS Hyrum Beef facility has experienced none."
