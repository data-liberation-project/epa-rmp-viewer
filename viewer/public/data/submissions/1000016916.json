              "Description": "Prevention of accidental releases of propane that can cause serious harm to the public and environment are mitigated through the development and employment of RMP prevention activities.  RPM prevention activities include safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, incident investigation, and compliance audits.\n\nPropane is stored above ground at the facility in one 30,000 gallon tank.  The NAICS code that most closely corresponds to the facilityA?s processes is 333618 A? other Engine Equipment Manufacturing.\n\nSeveral measures are employed to prevent accidents involving the propane system.  The measures also help reduce the number of equipment failures and down time and allow for the most efficient use of the facility processes and raw materials.  The elements of the facility's accident and failure prevention program are summarized below:\n\n-Safety Information\n-Hazard Review\n-Operating Procedures\n-Training\n-Maintenance\n-Compliance Audits\n-Incident Investigation\n\nSafety Information:\n\nThe following safety information related to the regulated propane systems at the TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. facility is provided.  This information will be modified and updated as necessary to ensure it accurately reflects site conditions.\n\n1.  Material Safety Data Sheets [MSDSs] that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g);  \nA copy of the MSDS for the propane used at the facility has been reviewed and is located at the facility in an accessible location. The MSDS was obtained from the facility's propane supplier.\n\n2.  Maximum intended inventory of equipment in which the regulated substances are stored or processed; \nThe maximum intended inventory of the propane tank at the facility is 111,000 pounds (at 60A? F).\n\n3.  Safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows, and compositions;\nPropane is a gas at normal temperatures and pressures. It is liquefied by storing it in a closed container at pressures higher than its equilibrium vapor pressure. There is a direct relationship between ambient temperature and the pressure inside the storage container. As the ambient temperature increases, the pressure of the container increases proportionately. According to NFPA 58, 1998 Edition, Table B-l.2.1, commercial propane when heated to a temperature of 105A? F will produce a pressure of 210 pounds per square inch, gauge (psig).\n\nNFPA 58, 1998 Edition, Table 2-2.2.2 sets the current minimum design pressure for an ASME tank at 250 pounds per square inch, absolute (psia).  This design allows for a maximum vapor pressure of 215 psia at 100A? F. The discharge piping for pumps and compressors is currently designed to 350 psia and vapor piping is designed for 250 psia according to NFPA 58, 1998 Edition, 3-2.10.2. The steel used in design of storage tanks and piping determines the minimum temperatures. Liquid propane (if released at atmospheric pressure) can refrigerate steel pipes and tanks down to temperatures of -44A?F.  \nAnother property of propane in its liquid form is its ability for the liquid to greatly expand when heated. Therefore, NFPA 58, 1998 Edition sets the maximum filling capacity of large tanks in Table 4-4.2.2(b) to avoid overfilling.\n\n4.  Equipment Specifications;\nThe equipment specifications for the regulated propane-systems at the TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. facility have been reviewed and are located at the facility in an accessible location.\n\n5.  Codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process.\nTo the best of the facility's knowledge, the regulated propane systems at the facility have been designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  To the extent possible, the facility will attempt to keep the regulated propane systems up-to-date with the current edition of NFPA 58.\n\nIf a major change to the regulated propane system occurs at the facility that makes the safety information inaccurate, the safety information provided in this section will be updated.  The codes used to design any modifications to the propane system at the facility will be reviewed and any modifications will comply with the applicable design codes.\n\nHazard Review:\n\nThere are hazards associated with the processes and procedures used to operate the propane systems.  The hazard review includes identification of the following:\n\n1.  The hazards associated with the process and regulated substances;\n2.  Opportunities for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release;\n3.  The safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunction or human error; and\n4.  Any steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases.\n\nThe hazard review was conducted by completing a standard Hazard Review Checklist, kept on file at the facility.  This Checklist was prepared based on the requirements of NFPA 58, 1998 Edition and supplemented with additional information from NPGA Safety Bulletin # 106-83 \"LP-Gas Bulk Storage Safety Inspection Checklist\".  The hazard review, which included inspecting all equipment associated with the regulated propane systems, was designed to determine whether the process is designed, fabricated and operates in accordance with the applicable standards or rules.  There are no unresolved problems at this time for the propane system.\n\nThe hazard review will be updated at least once every five years.  Additional hazard reviews will also be conducted whenever a major change in the regulated propane systems occurs; all issues identified in the additional reviews will be resolved before startup of the changed system.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. facility has obtained written procedures for operation of the regulated propane systems at the facility.  A copy of these written operating procedures is kept on file at the facility.  These procedures, which include filling of the tanks and operation of the vaporizer, provide instructions for safely conducting activities associated with the regulated propane systems.  Since the facility's propane cylinders are filled from the regulated propane tank, cylinder filling procedures are also kept on file at the facility.\n\nThe operating procedures will be updated whenever a major change in the regulated propane systems occurs; all changes will be made before startup of the changed system.\n\nTraining:\n\nThe TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. facility has ensured that each employee presently involved directly with the operation of a regulated propane system at the facility has been trained or tested competent in the operating procedures that pertain to their duties.  The training for the propane cylinder filling was provided using classroom instruction.  As part of the training, competency testing was used to ensure that the trained workers understood the training and can fill the cylinders safely.  Competency was demonstrated by observation of actually filling the cylinders by a qualified operator.\n\nSelect employees at the facility were already operating the regulated propane systems at the time TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. acquired the facility on December 29, 2004, and have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out their duties and responsibilities as provided in the operating procedures.\n\nWhen the RMP training program requires review or revision, the date of the review/revision will be provided.  At a minimum, the training program will be reviewed every three years as part of the refresher training.\n\nRefresher training will be provided at least every three years, and more often if necessary, to each employee operating a regulated propane process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.  The need for more frequent training will be determined in consultation with the propane systems operators.  Employees operating a regulated propane process will also be trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change.\n\nContractors used at the facility which play a role in the operation or maintenance of the regulated propane systems are also required to have training satisfying the requirements described above.  Documentation on contractor training should be obtained prior to their conducting work at the facility.\n\nMaintenance:\n\nThe TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. facility has prepared and implemented procedures to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of the regulated propane process equipment.  The maintenance procedures used for the regulated propane systems, which will be performed at least annually, are kept on file at the facility.  The date of the most recent review or revision of the maintenance procedures is indicated on the procedures.  Records of the annual maintenance activities will also be kept in facility files.\n\nA qualified contractor performs the maintenance of the regulated propane systems at the facility.  The contractor has the necessary training to safely and effectively implement the written maintenance procedures. Documentation on contractor maintenance training should be obtained prior to their conducting work at the facility.\n\nThe TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. facility also performs inspections and tests on the regulated propane system equipment on a quarterly basis.  The checklist used for this inspection/testing program is kept on file at the facility.  The completed checklists will be kept in facility files for at least a one-year period.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nThe TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. facility will evaluate compliance with the provisions of this document at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed under the RMP rules are adequate and are being followed.  The compliance audit will be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process of the compliance audit.  A report will be developed of the audit findings.  An appropriate response will be determined for each of the significant findings of the compliance audit, and implementation of the response action will be documented.  The two most recent compliance audit reports will be retained in facility files; however, this requirement does not apply to any compliance audit report that is more than five years old.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nThe TEAM Industries Andrews facility will investigate each incident, which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of propane (a catastrophic release is one that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment).\n\nThe investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  The person at the facility responsible for ensuring the incident investigation is properly conducted shall be the person responsible for RMP implementation.  A summary will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation that includes at a minimum:\n\n-Date of incident;\n-Date investigation began;\n-A description of the incident;\n-The factors that contributed to the incident; and,\n-Any recommendation resulting from the investigation\n\nA propane incident investigation form shall be provided in an accessible location at the facility.\n\nThe findings and recommendations of the investigation will be promptly addressed and resolved.  Resolutions and corrective actions will be documented.  In addition, the findings will be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are affected by the findings.\n\nThe investigation summaries will be retained for five years. The incident investigation requirements are summarized below:\n\n1.  Initiate an investigation promptly. The responsible person at the facility (person responsible for RMP implementation) shall begin investigation no later than 48 hours following the incident.\n2.  Summarize the investigation in a report.  This report should include the factors contributing to the incident.  The report should identify the underlying cause of the event as well as the initiating action.  The purpose of the report shall be to provide findings and recommendations to aid supervisory personnel in taking corrective action.\n3.  Address the findings and recommendations.  Promptly address the incident report findings and recommendations and document resolutions and corrective actions.",

      "SummaryText": "1. Overview of Risk Management Program\nThis document describes the Risk Management Program (RMP) for the propane storage system located at the Team Industries Andrews, Inc. facility in Andrews, NC.  The program described in this document is intended to satisfy the requirements of the RMP regulations promulgated in Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68).  The RMP for the facility has been developed in accordance with the USEPA RMP Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities, dated March 2009. The goal of the facility's RMP is to prevent accidental releases of propane that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment and to mitigate the effects of releases that may occur.\n\nThe facility is required to comply with RMP requirements because more than 18,000 pounds of propane are stored at the facility and the propane is used partially for non-fuel purpose in the heat treat process.  Each device using propane has its own shut-off valve.  The main shut-off valve for the plant is near the tank located off the southeast corner of the facility and is clearly marked.  The propane gas line that feeds the facility runs across the paved drive in a westerly direction to the vaporizer and then connects to the facility along the east wall.\n\nNo other toxic or flammable substances are stored at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68; consequently, only propane is addressed in this document.\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAs part of its overall emergency response program, TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. coordinates response actions with the local fire department.  TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. has made the fire department specifically aware of the propane system.  In the event of an incident involving the propane system, TEAM Industries Andrews, Inc. will contact the local fire department.\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "arolina facility is a manufacturing operation utilizing a 128,000-square foot industrial building.  The site is located at 3750 Airport Road north of U.S. 19/74/129.  The area is a rural river valley.\n\nManufacturing operations include those associated with production of outboard motor components and parts.  Specific operations include machining, aluminum conversion coating, aluminum impregnation, electrodeposition painting, surface finishing, and heat-treating.\n\nThe facility consists of one 30,000 gallon propane tank.\n\n4. Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the 30,000 gallon propane tank when filled to the maximum amount allowed.  This release would theoretically result in an endpoint distance of 0.4 miles.\n\nThe primary alternative release scenario that is most likely to occur at TEAM would be a pull-away explosion occurring between the transfer vehicle and the propane storage tank.  According to Amerigas (TEAM's propane provider) the amount of gas that would be released within ten minutes time is 8,214 lbs.
