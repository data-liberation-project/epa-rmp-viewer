In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release or sulfur dioxide release.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, conducted April 27 & 28, 2009, and Process Hazard Analysis Addendum, conducted in March 2010, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at The Wine Group - Sanger, California facility. The Wine Group - Sanger, California facility safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

      "SummaryText": "The attached Registration contains a summary of The Wine Group - Sanger administrative and operational programs to prevent ammonia-related and sulfur dioxide-related accidents and reduce potential risks.  The regulated substances of concern and focus of this document are anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia related or sulfur dioxide-related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter In Place plan would go into effect.  \r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the systems.  In the event that an ammonia or sulfur dioxide leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc. Maintenance Manager and/or their supervisor.  The Maintenance Manager and/or supervisor will determine what proce"

Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\r\n \r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility is located at 2916 South Reed Avenue in Sanger, California, which is approximately 1/5 miles south of California Highway 180 and 4 miles east of Academy Avenue.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\r\n\r\nAmmonia Systems\r\n\r\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of wine products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility uses approximately 26,500 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within three, closed-loop systems: Main System, System 1 (Betsy Ross Room), and System 2.  The Main System has an ammonia charge of approximately 23,800 pounds; the Betsy Ross Room (System 1) has an ammonia charge of approximately 1,800 pounds; and System 2 has an ammonia charge of approximately 900 pounds. The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.  \r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide Systems\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. stores sulfur dioxide in four one-ton cylinders (8,000 pounds) at two filling stations at the winery.  The one-ton cylinders serve as the supply to fill smaller hand-held sulfur dioxide cylinders \"guns\" (6 pound and 100 pound guns).  The portable dispensing \"guns\" are filled at a one ton cylinder and transported throughout the facility as needed for the wine making process. The sulfur dioxide cylinders and guns are always outdoors.  Sulfur dioxide is used at The Wine Group's facility to sparge the headspace of the wine tanks, which displaces air from the surface of the win"

Sulfur Dioxide is also injected directly into the wine products to meet sulfur compound level specifications.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia and sulfur dioxide above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\r\n\r\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n \r\n- Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\r\n- In depth process hazard analysis are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\r\n- Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\r\n- Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\r\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\r\n- Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\r\n- A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\r\n- A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\r\n- A management of change system"
