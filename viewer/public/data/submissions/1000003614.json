This program continues Charlotte-Mecklenburg UtilitiesA\u00bf commitment to the protection of its employees and the surrounding community and the control of the potential for such a release.  There have not been any accidental releases at the facility in the past five years.  Additional changes to increase our level of safety include upgrade of the chlorine scrubber system.  The scrubber tank was re-coated and an additional caustic pump and blower were added for redundacy.\r\nThe Lee S. Dukes Jr.  WTP currently uses chlorine (delivered in one ton cylinders) as a disinfection agent to meet Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.  As a portion of the RMP/PSM program, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities has developed the following accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the use of chlorine as a disinfectant:\r\n1) Protection of public health and our employees is Charlotte-Mecklenburg UtilitiesA\u00bf highest priority.\r\n2) Preventing the release of extremely hazardous substances is a key element of that protection.\r\n3) Every appropriate step will be taken to prevent releases, including management commitment to:\r\n    a) Make all important information readily available.\r\n    B) Routinely define training to employees\r\n    c) Clearly define roles and responsibilities.\r\n4 Fulfilling his or her role in prevention of these releases is a condition of employment for every employee.\r\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of a potential release, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities has incorporated the following general accidental release prevention program and chlorine-specific prevention steps:\r\n1) Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities plant maintenance staff shall conduct routine preventative maintenance of key process compone"
