      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at HVC Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Distribution.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous), Chlorine, Ammonia (aqueous), Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid].  In addition to the distribution, anhydrous ammonia is used for the manufacture of ammoonium hydroxide, chlorine is for the manufacturing of bleach and sulfur dioxide is used in the treatment of wastewater on-site.                                         .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 401000.00 lb. while Chlorine, Ammonia (aqueous), Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] are present at our facility in quantities of 312000.00 lb., 75609.00 lb., 6000.00 lb. and 1400.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves"

The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L. The above scenario is mandated by EPA's RMP regulation and is not a realistic portrayal of the worst case release.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from Sulfur dioxide storage.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of .  Sulfur dioxide liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 8.33 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 2.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Chlorine transfer.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of .  Chlorine liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 0.12 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s) and On-site response team.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of minimizing the release and would likley reduce the amount released well below the amount used in the calculation of this alternative release scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 2.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) involves a release from Anhydrous ammonia transfer.  The scenario involves the release of 9639.41 lb. of .  Aqua ammonia liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool "

Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of slowing the release of ammonia into the atmosphere and providing containment of the spill.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is 0.31 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Anhydrous ammonia transfer.  The scenario involves the release of 1000 lb. of .  Ammonia liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 0.41 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.19 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) [Hydrofluoric acid] involves a release from Hydrofluoric acid storage.  The scenario involves the release of 700 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of reducing the release of vapor once the product is released and minimizing the total quantity released.
