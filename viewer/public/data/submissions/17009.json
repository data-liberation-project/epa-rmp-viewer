      "SummaryText": "Indiana Borough owns and operates one municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Center Township, Indiana County, Pennsylvania. The plant is a secondary treatment facility with a hydraulic capacity of 6.0MGD and organic capacity of 6900lbs/day. The facility uses chlorine gas, which is considered hazardous by the EPA. Chlorine is a regulated substance under 40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements and meets the minimum requirements set forth in the EPA Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency policy at the plant is to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own employees, contractor employees, and to reduce the risk to nearby members of the community. Safe operations of the disinfection process which uses chlorine gas depends on the manner in which we manage this substance, combined with the safety devices inherent in each process design, handling procedures, inspection procedures, maintenance procedures and the proper training of employees in all of the procedures.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled is chlorine gas utilized in the disinfection process of the plant. The chlorine is infected through a solution feeder into the wastewater as it enters the chlorine contact tanks. A single one ton cylinder is used at time within the main control building. Maximum storage capacity at the plant is 6,000 lbs with an average daily storage of 3,000lbs.\n\nMid-State Chemical of Altoona, Pa supplies the chlorine and delivers two one ton cylinders at a time. The chlorine is supplied as a liquified gas under high pressure. \n\nThe worst case scenario assumes the failure or rupture of both one ton cylinders occurring when they are being moved into the chemical feed area or during transportation into the plant facility. It is assumed that the entire 4,000lbs of chlorine would be released over a 10-minute period. A distance to"

      "SummaryText": " endpoint was calculated at 3.0miles using Exhibit 4-3 of the WAstewater Treatment Plant Guidance Document. It has been further calculated in the Borough's Off-Site Response Plan that approximately 1500 people reside within 1.5 mile radius of the plant. The distance to the endpoint represents the maximum downward distance that could be affected by a release. This release will travel beyond the facility boundary. \n\nThe alternate release scenario assumes a vapor release from a 1/4 inch opening. The scenario represents a transfer pipe or vessel leak resulting from a faulty valve or gasket. Exhibit 4-15 of the Wastewater Treatment Plant Guidance Document was used to calculate a release rate of 9.0lbs/min through the hole with an endpoint of .2miles. This release may travel beyond the facility boundary. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The emergency response program is based on the facilities \"Off-site Response Plan\" which includes procedure for the notification of key facility management personnel and the following agencies:     Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, Indiana County Emergency Management Agency and HAZMAT Team, Local Fire Department, Police Department and  Essential Borough personnel. \n\nThere are no current changes, immediate changes or improvements planned for the chlorination process. The process complies with the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management. The plant has never experienced a spill of a hazardous material which includes chlorine."
