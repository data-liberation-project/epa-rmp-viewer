The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\n\n\n4.0\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for the City of Bay City Water Reclamation Plant chlorination and sulfonation processes.  The following details the prevention program elements at the City of Bay City Water Reclamation Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1\tSafety Information\n\nThe City of Bay City Water Reclamation Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the City of Bay City Water Reclamation Plant processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the City of Bay City Water Reclamation Plant, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n4.2\tHazard Review\n\nThe City of Bay City Water Reclamation Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the City of Bay City Water Reclamation Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n4.3\tOperating Procedure"
