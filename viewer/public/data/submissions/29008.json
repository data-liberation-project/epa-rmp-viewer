      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being prepared for use and storage of anhydrous ammonia for the refrigeration system at the Wells' Dairy St. George Plant in St. George, Utah.  The RMP program will meet and address the requirements of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  This Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\nThe stationary souce and regulated substances handled;\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls\nand mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario;\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\nThe five-year accident history;\nThe emergency response program; and \nThe planned changes to improve safety.\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel will be trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and us of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant for the St. George Plant's refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the air units and  shell and tube chillers, where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed to identify the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 parts per million.  The results are mitigated by the fact that all the ves"

Wells' Dairy is preparing a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the St. George Plant.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the plant (accidental release of anhydrous ammonia).  Wells' Dairy will conduct drills of the ERP.\n\nA five-year accidental release report has not been prepared since there have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Wells' Dairy is preparing a detailed Process Safety Management (PSM) program (Preventative Program 3).  The Preventative Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process.  Preventative Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\nWells' Dairy will incorporate or address any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, incident investigations, and program audits.  The flexibility of the program will allow Wells' Dairy to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing St. George Plant employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
