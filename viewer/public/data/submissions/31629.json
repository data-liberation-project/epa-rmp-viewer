      "SummaryText": "linder.  The highest risk operation at the facility is the changing of chlorine cylinders.  This operation is done during daytime hours.  The cylinder contains 1 ton of chlorine when it begins to leak.  The toxic endpoint is reduced by the mitigation measures in place, as described above.  The alternate release scenario is modeled using the EPA area location and air dispersion models ALOHA and T-SCREEN\u00e2 (Version 3.0, Britter-McQuaid model, 1992).   The distance to the toxic endpoint is 3 miles for the one-ton cylinder without mitigation measures in place.   With the mitigation measures, such as an enclosed building and automatic shutdown system, the toxic endpoint is reduced to less than 1.5 miles.  For the ALOHA model, the date and time of the accident scenario are assumed to be the day and time the model was run.  Local, typical meteorological conditions were obtained from the National Weather Service Office in San Diego.  The toxic endpoint is the highest concentration downwind of 10 parts per million, which is the value that is immediately dangerous to public health.  The toxic endpoint for the model run is approximately 800 yards (<1 mile).  The prevailing wind direction is generally north-northeast.  Under the worst-case scenario, there are several schools located within the 3-mile radius of the station.  Three of these schools are located downwind, as well as the California Division of Forestry fire station.  The three schools are located 2.5 to 3 miles away from the station.  The fire station is located approximately 0.5 miles from the station.  The ALOHA model run indicates that the fire station is within the dose concentration of concern (10 ppm at 1,054 yards).  Therefore, if a release did occur the facility could be impacted.  \n\nAdministrative controls and procedures are in place to quickly identify problems associated with leaking cylinders.   Leaking cylinders are repaired in a timely manner in order to minimize releases.   Proper chlorine gas handling"

      "SummaryText": "This risk management plan addresses the risk management program for Fallbrook Public Utility District Red Mountain Station.  This plan applies to the process conducted to store chlorine gas cylinders and to chlorinate the potable water supplies and distribution systems within the district.  Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and 1990 Amendments requires a risk management plan and program be developed for regulated substances used above certain thresholds within a process that could lead to an accidental release.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implements the Federal Clean Air Act by Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  In turn, Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations on Public Safety implements the Federal requirements with certain additions specific to the state.  The EPA has delegated its authority to the state and local regulatory agencies.  As such, the State of California has established threshold levels that are lower (more stringent) than the Federal thresholds.  Fallbrook Public Utility District\u00bfs Red Mountain Station inventory of chlorine gas [Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number 7782-50-5] cylinders is above the Federal and State regulatory threshold.   \n\nThis plan is prepared in compliance with the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health, Hazardous Materials Division, \u00bfCalifornia Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) Guidelines\u00bf (revised March 22, 2004).   This plan shall be reviewed annually and updated at least every 5 years.  This plan is intended to describe the responsibilities and activities necessary to respond to an accidental release of chlorine gas to personnel, the public, and the environment.   This plan is made available to the public and the local emergency responders (e.g., North County Fire Protection District, and California Division of Forestry).  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this district is 4941(water supply), and the North American Industrial Cl"

This plan addresses emergency response and accident prevention.  The chlorine handling procedure covers the safety aspects of changing chlorine cylinders and storage.  The hazardous material training programs consist of hazard identification, proper handling of chlorine cylinders, safety precautions, use of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), daily visual inspections, work orders, and corrective maintenance services.  The program also provides for training as first responders and hazardous material (HAZMAT) technician-level mitigation specialists.  The program implements the elements of the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management standards.   A process hazard evaluation has been performed and will be updated at least once every five years or whenever there is a new hazard or risk created by changes at the Red Mountain Station.\n\nThe Fallbrook Public Utility District was established as a political subdivision of the State of California in 1922 and operates under the provisions of the Public Utility District Act, Division 7, of the Public Utility Code as adopted in 1953.  The public utility district was needed for the prime purpose of supplying water to the town of Fallbrook and the surrounding residential and agricultural areas. \n\nThe Fallbrook Public Utility District encompasses approximately 27,963 acres (43.7 square miles) that includes district-owned watershed lands.  The District has an estimated population of 32,000 residents.  The District serves approximately 8,400 water connections on a regular basis.   In November 1994, the citizens of the Fallbrook Sanitary District voted to dissolve that district and have Fallbrook Public Utility District become"

The District serves approximately 7,900 sewer connections. \n\nThe District\u00bfs boundaries are adjoined by the Rainbow Municipal Water District, the Camp Pendleton Military Reservation, Riverside County, and the U.S. Naval Weapons Station at Fallbrook. Live Oak County Park is approximately 1 mile from the District\u00bfs boundary.   The area is unique in many ways due to its varying elevations and high rate of irrigation.  Average rainfall per year is approximately twenty-seven (27) inches.\n\nThe District is governed by a five (5) member board of directors.  Regular meetings of the board of directors are held monthly.  Registered voters of the District elect the directors to office for a term of four (4) years.  The District utilizes outside consultants on a continuous, as needed basis for operational and environmental concerns.\nThe District headquarters is located on 990 East Mission Road.   The District has two chlorine injection sites. Full one-ton (2,000 pound capacity) chlorine gas cylinders are routinely delivered to the chlorine injection site by an offsite chemical supplier.  The chlorine injection sites include the Wastewater Treatment Plant 1 Station and Red Mountain Station. The Wastewater Treatment Plant 1 Station has four (4) one-ton cylinders on-line and four (4) one-ton cylinders stored on-site.  The Red Mountain Station has two (2) one-ton cylinders on-line and four (4) one-ton cylinders stored on-site.  \n\nWhen the cylinders are empty, District personnel pick up the cylinders and replace the empty ones with full ones stored on-site.   The empty cylinders are stored temporarily at the site and picked up by the offsite chemical supplier in exchange for new full cylinders.

The chlorine gas cylinders are stored on a concrete pad that is enclosed by a concrete-block building with a metal roof.  Usage rates vary from one month to several months, up to one year for each station.      \n\nAn offsite-consequence analysis, using the worst-case scenario for an accidental release of chlorine gas is provided in Section 4 of this plan.  The worst-case scenario consists of failure of a full one-ton chlorine gas cylinder, releasing chlorine gas at ground level over a ten (10) minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter is 3 miles for the one-ton cylinder.  This release is based on worst-case weather conditions, outdoor operations, and is the distance at which chlorine gas no longer poses a hazard to the public.  The worst-case release scenario is modeled using the methodology identified in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \u00bfRisk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater Treatment Plants\u00bf, EPA 550-B-98-010.    The chlorine gas cylinders are designed to withstand a 45 miles per hour (mph) impact.   The worst-case scenario does not account for the mitigation measures that are in place.  The chlorine injection system is an enclosed vacuum system that is pressurized with automatic shutdown.  The chlorine cylinders are housed in an enclosed building.  The building provides a 55% reduction factor should a release occur inside the building.  The toxic endpoint distance is reduced from 3 miles to 1.5 miles.  An alternate scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario is provided in this section.   The alternate release scenario that more likely could occur based on operations and literature search, loading and off-loading procedures, and process knowledge is a small leak through a valve located in the center of one end of a chlorine cy"
