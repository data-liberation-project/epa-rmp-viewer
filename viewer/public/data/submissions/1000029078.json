      "SummaryText": "Saputo Cheese USA Inc. has developed, implemented and updated its Risk Management Program (RMP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) in accordance with the standards of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR Part 68) and Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) (29 CFR 1910.119).  All elements of these standards have been combined to create one program document herein referred to as the \"RMP\".  \r\n\r\nSaputo's RMP is comprised of the following sections which are summarized below.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n2.\tStationary source and the regulated substances handled\r\n3.\tWorst-case and alternative release scenarios\r\n4.\tGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention\r\n5.\tFive-year accident history\r\n6.\tEmergency response program\r\n7.\tPlanned changes to improve safety\r\n8.\tSeismic assessment\r\n\r\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nSaputo is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary.  We are also coordinated with the Fond du Lac LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses cheese and whey manufacturing. The plant is located at N3545 CR-EE, Waupun, WI 53963.  There is one RMP-regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, used in the Main Plant refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for production and warehousing. This system contains"

      "SummaryText": "18,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n \r\n3.  WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is defined as the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  For the WCS, the recirculator, containing a maximum inventory of 8,661 pounds at the high-level cutout condition, was assumed to have released its contents over a 10-minute period.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  For the ARS, a one-quarter inch effective diameter hole in a high side (e.g. 180 psig) pipe would result in a release of 134 pounds of ammonia per minute.  To limit the duration of the release, plant personnel would use controls and mitigation system within 10 minutes of leak detection.\r\n\r\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nSaputo maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the refrigeration process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled.  The What-If methodology was used to carry out the analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years or when changes dictate.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nStandard Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nSaputo maintains written standard operating procedures (SOP) for covered processes.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown,"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nSaputo ensures that operators are trained and understand the SOPs associated with the processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every three years and more frequently as needed.  The employees are also trained on \"Process Safety & Risk Management General Awareness Training for Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the plant's Emergency Action Plan. This training is also provided to new hires at orientation. All training is to be validated and documented for each employee.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nSaputo performs documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance is performed by qualified personnel, either in-house or by a contractor who has the appropriate training suited to their responsibilities.  Any identified equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose duties are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as required.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThese audits are carried out once every three (3) years to determine whether the provisi"

Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nSaputo promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release.  These investigations are conducted to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a future release.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years. Saputo has an Incident Investigation Team that will be utilized to carry-out any investigations.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nSaputo truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. Employees are part of the PSM Team, Incident Investigation and program development.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nSaputo hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.  Saputo has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nSaputo has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\r\n\r\n6.
