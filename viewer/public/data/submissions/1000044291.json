The vapors are irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract.  Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite.  Long term exposure to low concentrations and short-term exposure to high concentrations can result in adverse health effects from inhalation.  Ammonia is soluble in water, forming a corrosive liquid.  Although ammonia is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak initially hug the ground.  In liquid form, it is lighter than water.  Ammonia accelerates the burning of combustible material and is corrosive to metals and tissue.\r\n\r\nUses\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a raw material in chemical manufacturing operations and as a source of nitrogen for wastewater treatment.\r\n\r\n2.\tHydrogen Fluoride (HF)\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\nHydrogen Fluoride (HF) is a colorless fuming liquid, boiling at 67\u00b0F.  HF is shipped as a liquid confined under its own vapor pressure and is corrosive to metals and tissue.  Very short contact with fumes or small quantities of the liquid can cause severe, painful burns.  Vapors are heavier than air.  The liquid density is very close to that of water.  HF is completely miscible with water but yields significant heat of solution when mixed.\r\n\r\nUses\r\nHF is used as a catalyst and raw material in chemical manufacturing operations.\r\n\r\n3.\tPhosphorous Oxychloride (POCl3)\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\nPhosphorus oxychloride is a colorless to pale yellow fuming liquid with a pungent odor.  It is toxic by inhalation and ingestion and is strongly irritating to skin and tissues.  It causes burns to the mucous membranes of the mouth and digestive tract and may be fatal.  It reacts with water to form hydrochloric and phosphoric acids with evolution of heat.  It is corrosive to metals and tissue. \r\n\r\nUses\r\nPhosphorus oxychloride is used a"

Long term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health effects by inhalation.  PCl3 is a strong reducing agent that may ignite combustible organic materials upon contact.  It reacts with water to form hydrochloric and phosphoric acids with evolution of heat.  It is corrosive to metals and tissue.\r\n\r\nUses\r\nPhosphorus trichloride is used as a raw material in chemical manufacturing operations.\r\n\r\n5.\tAcetaldehyde\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\nAcetaldehyde is a clear, colorless liquid with a pungent odor.  However, under normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, liquid acetaldehyde will rapidly evaporate into a gas.  Its vapors are irritating to the mucous membranes and especially the eyes.  If it becomes contaminated, it may either react with the contaminant or polymerize, both with the evolution of heat.  It is lighter than water and soluble in water.  Its vapors are heavier than air.\r\n\r\nUses\r\nAcetaldehyde is a base ingredient used to produce other chemicals.  It eventually ends up in many products containing fibers and plastics.\r\n\r\n6.\tIsobutylene\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\nIsobutylene is a colorless gas with a faint, petroleum-like odor.  It is shipped as a liquefied gas under its own vapor pressure.  Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite.  Isobutylene is easily ignited; its vapors are heavier than air and a flame can flash back to the source of a leak very easily.  The leak can either be a liquid or vapor leak.  Vapor is irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat.  If inhaled, it can cause dizziness or loss of consciousness.  \r\n\r\nUses\r\nIsobutylene is used as a raw material in chemical manufacturing operations.\r\n\r\n7.\tPropylene\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\nPropyle"
