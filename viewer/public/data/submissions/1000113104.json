The facility's emergency response program is documented in the site Emergency Plan. The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n- Procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n- Information on emergency health care.\n- Emergency response training for employees.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits and process hazard analyses. The facility PSM team has regular meetings to manage progress and completion of these items. Current initiatives that are in progress include the following:\n- Evaluating installation of LEL monitors in tank farm.\n- Verifying the operating procedures cover scenarios addressed in the PHA.\n- Improvement of gas house controls and reduction of occupancy."

Aggregate propellants in finished goods in the warehouse are subject to Program 1 requirements because there are no public receptors within the worst-case scenario endpoint and there have been no accidents with reportable offsite consequences in the past five years.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPLZ Corp has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the EPA Risk Management Plan program. The facility complies with PSM and other OSHA regulations, NFPA standards, and insurance rules in order to help avoid accidental chemical releases and enhance safety. The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of propane, isobutane, n-butane, dimethyl ether, or 1,1-difluoroethane that could cause harm to employees, the public, and the environment. The emergency response program includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps. Key elements of the facility's safety program include written environmental health and safety procedures, employee training, and emergency response procedures.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving propane, isobutane, n-butane, dimethyl ether, or 1,1-difluoroethane in the five-year period prior to the issuance of this current revision of the Plan.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility coordinates emergency response activities with the Coal"

The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and emergency response program.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Plan identifies current operating procedures and policies in effect at PLZ Corp to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials. Proper emergency planning and response are important elements of any safety and health program to help minimize employee exposure and injury. Emergency preparedness procedures including release prevention, spill mitigation, emergency, and evacuation procedures; alarms; and emergency phone numbers have been implemented by PLZ Corp and are summarized in this Plan. Since acquiring the facility in 2018, PLZ Corp is dedicated to continuing the legacy of safe operation set by our predecessors manufacturing aerosol products in Coal City since the 1990\u0092s and site management is focused on executing the elements of the Plan in order to help ensure safe operation.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nPLZ Corp is located at 1300 E North St. in Coal City, Illinois (the facility). The facility is situated on the edge of town between residential and rural areas. The property consists of 20 acres that contains a manufacturing building including warehouses, an aerosol propellant tank farm, and a solvent tank farm. The facility utilizes flammable propellants to manufacture aerosol hair products. The propellants are stored in fifteen aboveground propellant storage tanks at the facility. The propellant storage area is equipped with truck racks to unload propellant from tanker tru"
