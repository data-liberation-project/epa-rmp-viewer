Emergency\nresponse activities are coordinated with the Pryor Fire Department and Mayes County Local Emergency\nPlanning Committee.\nThe facility utilizes a plant wide emergency notification system consisting of a remote wireless\nactivated rotating siren centered in the facility and hand-held radios to assist with employee notification\nand communications during emergency situations.\nThe latest large-scale emergency response drill was conducted at PCC on November 1, 2017. The\ndrill was coordinated with Mayes County Emergency Management, Pryor Fire Department, Mayes\nEmergency Services Trust Authority, Hillcrest Medical Center, Oklahoma State Department of Health,\nMayes County Department of Health, Air-Evac, Tulsa Life Flight, and the Mayes Country Sheriff. This\ndrill was planned over the course of many months with the purpose of exercising the emergency\npreparedness and interoperability of the Pryor Chemical personnel with outside response agencies. The\nemergency scenario involved a disturbed truck driver who purposefully began releasing ammonia from his\ntruck while on the PCC site. The drill was attended by observers with a follow-up meeting to critique the\nevent.\n3.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nPCC continues to improve and enhance the safety programs and culture established at the\nfacility. PCC is currently continuing expansion of the fire protection systems throughout the facility. In\naddition, PCC has recently implemented the Safety Interaction Process at the facility which creates an\ninteractive approach for management to be involved with associates performing in-field work processes."

The regulation requires the inclusion of accidental releases from\ncovered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known\noffsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental\ndamage.\nThere has been one release event at PCC over the past 5 years that could potentially meet\nthe criterion of significant on-site property damage. The referenced event occurred on May 14,\n2020 and involved the high-pressure release of 3,400 lbs of anhydrous ammonia from failed piping\nin the Ammonia Plant. The release resulted in minor on-site equipment damage. The incident\ninvestigation showed that there were weld quality issues at the pipe fracture, and the original piping\nsupport was inadequate. The event was reported to the NRC under Case No.1277211. There were\nno on-site or off-site deaths, injuries or evacuations associated with this event.\nThere have been no other release events in the 5-year period that meet the reporting criteria\nfor on-site or off-site consequences.July 22, 2022 5\n3.5 Emergency Response Programs\nPCC maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which provides the essential planning and\ntraining for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergencies. The\nplan contains procedures for emergency response, such as first aid and medical treatment, evacuations,\nnotification to local emergency response agencies and the public, and post incident measu"

Additionally, incidents involving near misses are investigated. These investigations are\nundertaken to identify the root cause of the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to\nprevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n3.2.10 Employee Participation\nPCC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.\nEmployees are strongly encouraged to be knowledgeable with the facility\u2019s RMP program and\nexpress their views concerning accident prevention issues and recommended improvements.\nEmployees have access to the facility\u2019s RMP program and information resulting from process\nhazard analyses.\n3.2.11 Hot Work Permits\nPCC has in place a standard hot work procedure, which establishes a system to ensure\nadequate controls are maintained to detect and eliminate hazardous conditions associated with fire\nor \u201chot work\u201d. The system dictates the coordination of hot work, pre-permit preparations, fire\nwatch requirements, air monitoring, personnel protection equipment, special precautions, and other\ndepartment responsibilities.July 22, 2022 4\n3.2.12 Contractors\nPCC hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.\nPrior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is\nconducted.

Contractors are informed of all procedures for emergency response, should an accidental\nrelease of a regulated substance occur.\n3.3 Chemical Specific Release Prevention Steps\nPCC has instituted several process controls to prevent and/or mitigate accidental releases from the\nammonia produced and stored at the facility. Passive mitigation systems include earthen dikes, drains, and\nsumps. Active mitigation systems include sprinkler systems, scrub"
