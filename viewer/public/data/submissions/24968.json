Corbalis, WTP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nThe Fairfax County Water Authority (FCWA) occupies approximately 112 acres in western Fairfax County at the James J. Corbalis Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The Corbalis WTP is located on Stuart Road, approximately 4,000 feet south of Leesburg Pike, State Route 7.   Currently, construction efforts are underway to extend the Fairfax County Parkway along the west perimeter of the Corbalis WTP. \r\n\r\nThe Corbalis WTP is a drinking water provider and has a planned capacity to provide an  ultimate 200 million gallons of drinking water a day.   Operations at the J. Corbalis WTP fall into the 4941 Standard Industrial Classification.\r\n\r\nAt the J Corbalis WTP, the FCWA pumps, treats and distributes water from the Potomac River Watershed to customers in the Northern Virginia Region.  To ensure the highest quality drinking water is available to its customers, the FCWA uses chlorine and anhydrous ammonia as disinfectants to remove and control the growth of otherwise potentially harmful microorganisms and pathogens in the drinking water supply.  Because of their relative toxicity, chlorine and anhydrous ammonia are listed as regulated substances under the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA), Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.  Under the provisions, EPA requires that facilities having regulated chemical processes above specific threshold quantities implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) covering each regulated process.\r\n\r\nThe FCWA's RMP describes the potential environmental impacts and the toxicity hazards presented by the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia inventories at the J. Corbalis WTP.  Moreover, the RMP describes the FCWA's procedures to minimize the risk and prevent unwanted releases of either chemical into the surrounding communities.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\r\n\r\nThe FCWA has adopted policies that"

As directed by EPA regulations, the FCWA assumed a worst-case release scenario to consist of a 1-ton cylinder depleting its contents over a 10 minute release period.  Such a chlorine release would tend to sink, hug the ground, or follow low lying areas due to the fact that chlorine is approximately 2.5 times heavier than air.  Depending on the ambient weather conditions (i.e. wind speed and direction) and the topography of the surrounding land, the chemical plume can impact the surrounding region and cause damage to human health and the environment.    \r\n\r\nTo determine how far from the Corbalis WTP a chlorine plume would travel from a 1-ton cylinder over a 10 minute release period, the FCWA utilized Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) dispersion modeling reference tables.   Additionally, the FCWA utilized the Fairfax Joint Local Emergency Planning Committee's (FJLEPC) modeling conducted in accordance with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook.  These approaches conservatively estimate a potential impact area that is circular with the center being the point of release.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nAgain, although ammonia releases are rare at WTPs, the FCWA has conducted an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) to evaluate the potential impacts on the surrounding communities should an unwanted release occur.  As directed by the EPA regulations, the FCWA assumed a worst-case release scenario to consist of a 1,000 gallon storage tank depleting its contents over a 10 minute release period.

Depending on the ambient weather conditions (i.e. wind speed and direction) and the topography of the surrounding land, the chemical plume can impact the surrounding region and cause damage to human health and the environment.    \r\n\r\nTo determine how far from the plant an anhydrous ammonia plume would travel from a 1,000 gallon storage tank over a 10 minute release period, the FCWA utilized the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) dispersion modeling reference tables.   These approaches conservatively estimate a potential impact area that is circular with the center being the point of release.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario - Chlorine\r\n\r\nConsidering that the aforementioned worst-case release scenario is ultra-conservative and unrealistic in terms of the potential impact area, the FCWA is required to conduct an alternate release scenario for chlorine. This variation of the worst-case scenario is considered more realistic than the worst-case scenario.  The impact area must still include off-site receptors.  However, it is important to understand that although the occurrence of the alternate release scenario is considered as more realistic, the FCWA considers it still to be highly unlikely due to engineering and administrative controls at the Corbalis WTP.   \r\n\r\nEPA regulations encourage facilities to select the alternate release scenario from one that has occurred at some point in the past at the facility or from one identified through the process hazards analysis.  Due to no historical off-site releases at the Corbalis WTP, the alternate release scenario selected, although still unlikely, was one identified through the process hazard analysis.

Corbalis WTP for either chlorine or anhydrous ammonia within its 17 year operating history.\r\n\r\nOverview of the Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe EPA RMP regulations have three tiers of compliance based upon the relative degree of effort necessary to minimize the risk to off-site receptors.  The tiers are established as Program 1, Program 2 and Program 3.  As a rule of thumb, since the FCWA's off-site consequence analysis affected off-site receptors, the FCWA falls into the Program 3"

The FCWA will review and update the PHA's at least every five years or after any significant modification or change to the chlorine or ammonia systems at the WTP.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nDetailed operating procedures for the chlorine and ammonia systems have been  developed.  The procedures are detailed step-by-step instructions for safely performing operations on the chlorine and ammonia systems in a manner to minimize the risk of an accidental release.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure up-to-date operating procedures, the FCWA will review and update the PHA's at least every five years or after any significant modification or change to the chlorine or ammonia systems at the WTP.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nAll employees who work with the chlorine or ammonia systems at the J. Corbalis WTP have received on the job training of the processes and their hazards.  Moreover, each employee assigned a safety sensitive function will be part of an on-going safety training program.  \r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\r\nThe chlorine and ammonia systems are maintained under the plant's computerized maintenance system known as Tooltime.  As preventive maintenance activities are scheduled, work orders are printed and issued to the responsible craft supervisor.  Should equipment be found in need of repair, either during scheduled PM or at any other time, a corrective maintenance (CM) work order is issued.  Finally, once work has been completed, that information and any other data are entered into Tooltime.  This system permits the Corbalis WTP to continuously strive for and achieve its goal of zero failures (i.e., no loss of production and 100 percent resolution of identified safety concerns).\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThe ensure compliance with the RMP regulations compliance audits will be conducted  to evaluate the FCWA's safe work procedures to determine if their implementation are compliant with the applicable codes and regulations.
