If not properly handled, propane can be dangerous, just like the fuel in automobiles.  Only qualified personnel, properly trained in appropriate operating procedures, are allowed to handle equipment associated with our propane systems.  We are committed to safety in all aspects of our business, and the propane storage and handling is no exception.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations at a minimum.  \n\nOur emergency response program includes procedures followed by all employees for notification of the local emergency services department and the site safety manager.\n\nFacility description and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture cat litter and related products.  Propane is used to fuel miscellaneous small portable equipment throughout the facility, and as a backup to fuel our rotary drum dryers, which are used in the manufacturing of our products.  The handling of propane at this facility is limited to delivery (via delivery truck), transfer/loadout to small containers on portable equipment, and transferred via closed piping to process equipment during natural gas interruptions.  Access to our facility is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is propane.  The maximum amount of propane stored at this facility is 58,380 pounds, distributed among two propane storage tanks.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s)\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nFailure of the largest storage tank on site when filled to the greatest amount allowed, including written administrative controls, would release 44,100 pounds of propane.  Without administrative controls, 110,880 pounds of propane could be released.  The worst ca"

      "SummaryText": "se scenario assumes that the entire contents of 44,100 pounds are released as vapor, which finds an ignition source, and explodes.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the explosion.\n\nUtilizing the software modeling program, RMP*CompTM, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure from a 44,100 pounds propane release is 0.3 miles.\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nFor the alternative scenario, a pull-away explosion was chosen because it best represented the more likely of alternative scenarios - one which involves human error.   A pull-away causing failure of a 25 foot length of 4 inch hose was analyzed.  The excess flow valves function to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose, 69 pounds, is released.  The resulting unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit.\n\nUtilizing the software modeling program, RMP*CompTM, the distance to endpoint for the lower flammability limit for the alternative scenario is 0.02 miles (about 106 feet).  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis propane storage and handling facility complies with California's and EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rules, CalARP and 40 CFR 68.  This facility stores and handles propane only for onsite use as fuel.  Onsite storage is maintained at a minimum for daily portable equipment and backup for process heaters in the event of natural gas interruption.\n\nThe propane systems at this facility were designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA 58, 1998 Edition.  All employees whom handle any of the propane equipment have been thoroughly trained utilizing company and NFPA guidelines.\n\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nThis facility has had no reportable accidents associated with our propane storage and handling in the last five years.\n\nEmergency response program\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Handbook, Guid"

The emergency response program has been discussed with the City of Taft Fire Department.  Representatives from the City of Taft Fire Department conducted a site visit on January 6, 1999.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nThis facility was constructed in 1987 and is in compliance with NFPA 58.  Upon completion of the hazard review required by this regulation, it was determined that it also complies with NFPA 58, 1998 Edition.\n\nA revised, more formal, inspection and maintenance program, along with more formal training will be incorporated as a result of the recent hazard review."
