Executive Summary Report\n\n1. \tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Hancock Foods Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is blast freezing freshly harvested blueberries.  The berries are then stored in a cold storage Freezer. We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This is Anhydrous Ammonia, and is used as a refrigerant for both the Blast Freezing Process, and the cold storage area. \n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenario, and alternate release scenario, we have used the RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations. The following paragraph provides details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the refrigeration systems largest liquid receiver.  In this scenario 9800lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 1.42 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Imeco High Pressure Receiver.  The scenario involves the release of 1000 lbs. of ammonia. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes. Under neutral"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHancock Foods Inc. maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all refrigeration operations. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes have been identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out the process hazard analysis was the \u00bfWhat If Checklist\u00bf format.  A third a third party consultant who acted as team leader, as well as our plant team who are qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and the operation s of the refrigeration operation undertook the study. The study is updated according to regulated intervals. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our facility, Hancock Foods Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. This information is sometimes used as training material. \n\nTraining\nHancock Foods Inc. has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the process are competent.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed. Training consists of on the job, hands on training. Operators mus"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  All checks are documented and stored. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Hancock Foods Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The management of change program is reviewed often, most recently 8/25/04. In the past 5 years Hancock Foods has not made any process changes that would facilitate the use of the management of change process. \n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Hancock Foods Inc.  The most recent review was performed in July of 2004. Each year before the start up of the York Blast tunnel regular pre start up procedure and reviews are strictly adhered to. These reviews are conducted to confirm that equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nHancock Foods Inc. conducts audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted in March of 1999.  \n\nIncident Investigation\nHancock Foods Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
