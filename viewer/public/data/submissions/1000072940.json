              "Description": "Process Safety Management Program (?68.175)\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 Prevention Program under the EPA risk management program requirements in ?68.175. The refrigeration system is a single process, with no other processes that are regulated by this standard. Sysco Chicago (Freezer) has a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Materials, including Emergency Response provisions. The written PSM plan can be accessed on Sysco?s ePSM online database. \n\nThe written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include: employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This PSM plan will be reviewed and updated as necessary by Sysco?s PSM Committee.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan (?68.180)\n\nAs part of the PSM program, the facility has developed a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. The EAP includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside agencies. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the anhydrous ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Sysco and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place: \n\n\n\n?    Trained and Certified Personnel \n\n?    Incident Command Center \n\n?    Emergency Alarm and Communication System \n\n?    Shelter-In-Place locations, Evacuation Plans, and outside Assembly Points \n\n?    Personal Protective Equipment \n\n\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance has been formally established with the Des Plaines Fire Department. \n\nAll facility personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvements.  The Emergency Action Plan (EAP) will be reviewed and updated as necessary by the Sysco Chicago Safety Director.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program and Emergency Response Information for RMP  \n\nIn conjunction with submission of Sysco?s RMP, facilities subject to Program 3 (PSM Program) regulations must submit details about its PSM Program to EPA, per ?68.175.  In addition, the facility must also submit details regarding its ERP, per ?68.180.  Appendix D provides additional details regarding information submitted to EPA for both the PSM Program and the ERP.\n\n",

This commitment is demonstrated by Sysco's comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  It is Sysco's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such releases to occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the Des Plaines Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n1.2    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (?68.155(b))\n\nWe have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is ammonia (anhydrous). The highest expected inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) at this facility is 15,000 pounds (rounded to two significant digits for reporting purposes).   \n\n\n\n1.3    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (?68.155(c))\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. Our ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility. \n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nSysco Chicago (Freezer) has compiled information related to the hazards of the ammonia refrigeration system installed at the facility. Prior to conducting to the initial hazard analysis, the process safety information was reviewed and utilized in identifying and mitigating recognized hazards. The process safety information was also used in the development of the operating procedures.   \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: \n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive st"
