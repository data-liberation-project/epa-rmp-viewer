The facility is a fractionator that uses a feedstock known as commercial butane.  The Petal fractionator is a natural gas liquids processing facility, which fractionates the commercial butane into propane, isobutane and normal butane.  Since the last reporting period, the fractionator facility has been decommissioned.  It has been deinventoried of hydrocarbons, placed under an inert (nitrogen) environment, and is isolated from the remainder of the facility.\n\nThe storage tanks associated with this facility remain in service.

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nProcess Safety Information\tProcess Hazard Analysis\tOperating Procedures\nTraining\tMechanical Integrity\tManagement of Change\nPre-Startup Safety Review\tCompliance Audits\tIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation\tHot Work Permits\tManagement of Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have multiple programs in which our employees participate.  We have a training program in which the Operations/Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operations of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies as well as training in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use and apply the guidelines of our Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which include all of the above listed areas.\n\nThe Operations personnel make regular walk-through inspections of the equipment and process they operate.

There have not been any reportable releases, which involved any type of accidental releases involving material covered under the EPA's RMP rule, during the past five years at this facility.\n\nIf there is a reportable incident, Enterprise will conduct a formal incident investigation(s) to identify and correct the root causes of the event(s).\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.

The program has recently been reviewed and written management systems have been updated and strengthened.\n\u00b7\tWe incorporated an electronic system that organizes, tracks and files all of the management of change projects.\n\u00b7\tThe mechanical integrity program is presently being reviewed and updated.\n\u00b7\tThe Safety Procedures are periodically reviewed and updated.\n\u00b7\tWe plan to conduct safety inspections of the operating process units as well as continue to conduct PSM audits."
