      "SummaryText": "Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nDole Packaged Foods, LLC - Atwater Operations (Dole), Atwater, California Facility (Facility) is located at 7916 West Bellevue Road, Atwater, California, approximately 0.5 miles north of State Route 99 (Golden State Highway). The Facility process and packages fruit and vegetable products. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the Facility's Plant 1 and Plant 2 refrigeration system processes. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDole has developed a California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program in general accordance with the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4, and Federal EPA requirements, 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan (RMP), and federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119 and California OSHA 8 CCR 5189 to enhance existing anhydrous ammonia safety and emergency response programs. Dole is committed to worker and public safety through investment in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration systems. Dole's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Dole has developed an Emergency Response Plan to respond to a release of ammonia in the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the Facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\nDole has two anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at the Facility to support its primary operation of processing and freezing fruit. The refrigeration processes are separated between Plant 1 and Plant 2. Plant 1 and Plant 2 are two-stage closed-loop ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\n\n\nThe Plant 1 refrigeration system process is composed of the following key components:\n\n? High stage compressors\n\n? Booster compressors\n\n? Condensers\n\n? HPR\n\n? Anhydrator\n\n? Intercoolers\n\n? Recirculator packages\n\n? Evaporators \n\n?

Trade Secrets (none associated with the ammonia refrigeration system)\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary\n\nThe CalARP and federal RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling system covered by the CalARP/RMP programs. Facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the Facility. An alternative release scenario must be evaluated for each covered process. This Facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios. As recommended by EPA, these are not summarized herein but are presen"

      "SummaryText": "ted in the CalARP/RMP.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the Dole Facility in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nDole is a responding facility and has developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP provides Facility personnel general guidelines and procedures in preparing for and responding to emergency situations that may occur at the Facility, such as responding to a fire, an unplanned or accidental release of a hazardous material, medical emergencies, bomb threats, site evacuation, etc. The ERP also provides resources for agency notification, coordination among Facility personnel and outside responders, and internal and/or external use in emergency planning/preparedness. Emergency response actions are coordinated with local emergency response agencies annually.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDole performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in June 2019 and generated a list of recommendations to improve safety and mitigate potential releases. Dole will address PHA recommendations within the 2 ?-year time frame set forth in the January 1, 2015, CalARP requirements. These changes to improve safety include:\n\n? Developing preventive maintenance tasks under the mechanical integrity program to include condenser pressure switches, additional piping inspections, periodic monitoring of defrost sequencing and testing of emergency stops;\n\n? Consideration of creating operating procedures for the high and low ambient temperature operation and loss of water;\n\n? Installing a second emergency escape pack to the Plant 1 and Plant 2 engine rooms;\n\n? Consideration of modifying the return piping of HX04 to IC01A; and\n\n? Expanding start of shift procedures to inspect emergency egress, emergency stop accessibility and walking surfaces.\n\n\n\nManagement responses and actions will be consistent with Dole's commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operation. Dole recognizes that the CalARP/RMP/PSM program is"

      "SummaryText": " a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its Facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Dole continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Dole will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the CalARP/RMP/PSM program, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Dole's practices, and Dole will maintain the most current version onsite. Thus, the most current version of the CalARP/RMP/PSM program and related documents and elements maintained onsite may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to regulatory agencies."
