      "SummaryText": "The Kaplan Wastewater Treatment Plant is a publicly owned and operated wastewater treatment system which services the city limits of Kaplan, Louisiana in the Parish of Vermilion.  From 1990 Census Data, the total population of Kaplan is 4,415 persons, and the plant services over 2,000 customers within the City.\n\nA worst-case release and alternative release scenarios were conducted for the Plant.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (October 1998) was utilized as a guidance to conduct each scenario. \n\nFor the worst-case scenario, the analysis considered the quantity released to be the maximum capacity of the largest vessel.  Therefore, for an accidental release from the largest vessel, the entire affected area is within a 1.3 mile radius of the Plant.  The affected area for the alternative release scenario was calculated to be within a 0.1 mile radius of the Plant.  The alternative scenario was conducted for holes in the vessels ranging from 1/16 inch to 1/2 inch in diameter.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel operate the Plant in accordance with general practices to protect human health and public safety.  Proper maintenance and precautions in operating the process equipment is crucial for the general accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant has not had any accidental releases of chlorine in the past five (5) years.  Since the Plant is not equipped to handle emergency response in case of a major release of chorine, an emergency response list is compiled which lists the order in contacting emergency response teams"
