Safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility are in place to help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nThe Infineon facility has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nAn emergency response program was developed by Infineon in accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations. The key components of this program include:\n- Development of emergency response plan containing the following elements\n- Procedures for informing public and local emergency response agencies\n- Proper first aid and emergency medical treatment\n- Procedures for response after an accidental release\n- Procedures for emergency response equipment use, inspection, testing, and maintenance\n- Training for all employees\n- Procedures for emergency response plan review and updates.\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nInfineon is committed to continuous improvement and will continue to review the operation and make improvements where appropriate to further improve safety."

A standard audit form is used to document each step and to ensure an effective audit is conducted and proper follow-up is accomplished.  \n\nIncident Investigation - Incidents that result in or could have resulted in a release of HCl are investigated immediately. Each incident is investigated in an attempt to identify the root cause of the incident and to implement corrective actions to prevent future incidents. The incident investigation elements include a description of the accident, process description, process flow diagram, recommendations, and review with affected personnel.\n\nEmployee Participation - Employee Participation is an element that is integrally linked to all of the other elements. Employee participation is a core part of our business strategy. Employees are involved in documenting process safety information, conducting hazard analysis, writing, and reviewing procedures, conducting training, managing change, investigating incidents, and assuring safe work practices are followed.\n\nHot Work Permit - The hot work permits issued at the facility document that all fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to the start of any hot work operations. Each issued permit identifies the date(s) authorized to perform the hot work and the equipment on which the hot work is to be performed, as well as site preparation and safety equipment requirements and documentation.\n\nContractors - Prior to starting any work on or adjacent to the HCl process equipment, contractors are required to provide detailed information regarding their safety and health performance record. Contractors are then informed of potential hazards they may be exposed to; emergency action plans in place and required safe work practices. They are also informed of their responsibilities to ensure that their"

Review and updates of the process hazard analysis will be conducted every 5 years. \n \nOperating Procedures - Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the HCL process.\n\nTraining - Training is one of the most critical elements of risk management. Requirements for operating personnel include initial training on the process, procedures, hazards and safe work practices, and refresher training at least every three years. All employees receive basic training consisting of an overview of the process and the hazards present.\n\nMechanical Integrity - The Mechanical Integrity element helps to assure that the condition of critical equipment is monitored, maintained, and documented. Infineon utilizes a computerized maintenance management system to help organize mechanical integrity activities and records. Regularly scheduled inspection and preventative maintenance intervals comply with applicable codes and good engineering practice.\n\nManagement of Change - Numerous industrial incidents have been caused by unauthorized or inappropriate changes to equipment. Infineon follows a Management of Change (MOC) procedure where additions, deletions, or modifications undergo thorough review. The MOC procedure documents the basis and scope of the change, the effect on hazards, updates to Process Safety Information, Procedures, and Training.\n\nPre-Startup Review - Prior to startup of a changed process or affected part of the process, employees involved in operating the process, maintaining the process, and contract employees affected by a change are informed of and trained in the changes. Additionally, process safety information and operating procedures are updated to reflect the changes necessary.\n\nCompliance Audits - RMP compliance audits will be conducted at least every three (3) years.

HCl is supplied to the facility by a Bulk Supply Gas System (BSGS) that includes an HCl tube trailer provided by a 3rd party vendor. The BSGS system is located on-site at the north side of the facility. HCl is delivered from the tube trailer to the HCl distribution system through a single feed line to the production building.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved, as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The accident prevention program elements include Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Operator and Maintenance Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Emergency Planning and Response, Incident Investigation, an Employee Participation Plan, Contractor Safety Evaluation and Orientation, and Safe Work Practice Procedures.\n\nProcess Safety Information - Written process safety is an assemblage of equipment design specifications, process technology knowledge, and chemical hazard information. This reference material includes Piping and Instrumentation Drawings (P&ID's), materials of construction, and design codes and engineering standards.

(Infineon) Semiconductor Facility.\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\nInfineon's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to this facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. \nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nStationary Source, Regulated Substances Handles & Covered Process:\nInfineon owns and operates a semiconductor epitaxy (Epi) wafer facility (SIC code 3674) in Mesa, Arizona. Infineon is located at 550 West Juanita Avenue in Mesa, Maricopa County, Arizona. The approximate location is 33.383056 Latitude and -111.843889 Longitude. \n\nInfineon utilizes anhydrous hydrogen chloride (HCl) for the wafer etching steps and process cleaning steps performed at the facility. HCl is a listed chemical in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations under Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (29 CFR) \u00a71910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), and a regulated substance under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions). Since the manufacturing process at Infineon contains HCl in quantities greater than the PSM and RMP applicability threshold of 5,000 pounds, Infineon has developed and implemented RMP and PSM plans for the HCl storage and distribution systems."
