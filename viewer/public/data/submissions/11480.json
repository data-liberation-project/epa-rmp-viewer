The entire complex is surrounded by chain link fence for security.  The ammonia system is designed with high pressure and low pressure cutouts thoughout. Relief valves and backups are located on each pipe and vessel whIch has more than 10# ammonia capcity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The ammonia system has been designed to alarm, turn on ventilation and auto dial Emergency Responders when  50 PPM ammonia is detected and and  to shut off liquid solenoids upon detection of ammonia > 1,000 PPM.  Ammonia detectors have been installed in five locations throughout the facility where ammonia systems are located, including ice cream processing areas,  the compressor room and freezer warehouse. Emergency Solenoids will cut off the flow of liquid and the compressors will continue to run so the pipes are evacuated.  Emergency E-stops to shut down compressors are located in two areas outside of the compressor room. \n\nAll drains in the facility have secondary containment that goes to holding tank for treatment should liquid ammonia go down the drain. \n\nEmergency Response \n\nThe facility has five Level A suits and four Hazwoper 'Technician Level'  trained ammonia response personnel.   Additional equipment include two spare masks and four spare tanks.                                                                                                                                                              Responders are trained to respond in Level C suits and full face respirators when ammonia concentratioins are below"
