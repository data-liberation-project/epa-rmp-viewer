If an emergency were to occur with offsite consequences, it is our policy to notify the Groveland Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Florida Select also has an internal Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThis facility processes fresh citrus fruit to produce orange juice and juice concentrate during the fruit harvesting season.  During the off season, this facility reconstitutes juice from the concentrate.  The juice and concentrates are both refrigerated and frozen using an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The two-stage ammonia refrigeration system consist of storage tanks, receiving tanks, high stage compressors, low stage compressors, gas chillers, glycol chillers, dumpers, shell/tube condensers, evaporative condensers, blowers, an oil separator, and associated piping and fittings.  The two 1000 gallon storage tanks are located outdoors just northeast of the main building.  Safety devices are installed on the system including check valves, liquid level gauges, manual shut-off valves, pressure relief valves, and perimeter crash posts around the storage tanks.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario:  The worst case scenario is catastrophic failure of one 1000 gallon outdoor storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed which results in a toxic vapor cloud.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint (200 ppm) is 0.9 miles.  The public receptors potentially im"

      "SummaryText": "pacted within this radius are residential and business buildings, a school, and a city park with a total estimated population of 330 persons.  \n\nAlternative Scenario:  The alternative scenario evaluated is a 1/2 \" diameter rupture in an indoor pressure vessel.  The estimated distance to the endpoint of such a release is 0.1 miles.  No residents, public receptors or environmental receptors are located within this radius.\n\nAccident History:  This facility has never had an accident involving ammonia that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in place.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  In order to comply with the RMP, we have implemented changed in operation and maintenance procedures, training and compliance audits with respect to ammonia.  Florida Select has also reviewed the procedures employed by the contractor (Tanner) which supplies the ammonia.  Physical changes currently planned include replacement of some of the pressure relief valves by 12/11/99."
