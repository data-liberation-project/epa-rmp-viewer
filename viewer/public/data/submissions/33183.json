      "SummaryText": "Since Hawkins, Inc. was founded in 1938, the company has become a critical source of chemical products for communities and businesses across the upper Midwest.  For example,  municipal and industrial water treatment facilities in the region rely on Hawkins for water disinfectants and other treatment products, equipment and expertise.\n\nHawkins, Inc. is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with branches that meet local needs in seven neighboring states.  The company's primary business is to repackage, custom-blend and distribute products for the water disinfection, pharmaceutical, food, computer and other industries.  \n\nHawkins has prepared and filed a Risk Management Plan for its St. Paul facility, also known as Terminal One, which has redirected its primary activities.  In 2001, the receiving/repackaging of chlorine from manufacturers and the production of bleech was redirected to another terminal within the Hawkins, Inc. group.  Terminal One now provides the customized services such as blending safer agricultural fertilizers and stores a caustic solution, ammonium hydroxide.  The Risk Management Plan is now focussed on the storage of ammonium hydroxide \n\nThe Risk Management Plan that Hawkins staff has filed for this facility is a planning and prevention tool; it helps us to better identify hazards and communicate with others.   Risk Management Plans are developed by facilities that have sufficient quantities of any of 140 hazardous materials on site; at this facility, we handle two of those materials.  In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that 150,000 Risk Management Plans have been submitted since the original June 1999 due date.\n\nThe product covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility ammonium hydroxide.  The ammonium hydroxide is used in our agricultural products.\n\nRisk Management\n\nHawkins provides products critical to meeting the region's public health and the manufacturing needs.  Some of these products pose risks, whic"

      "SummaryText": "h is why all Hawkins employees share a commitment to safety.  Our safety policy states:\n\"Hawkins, Inc. recognizes its obligation to provide all employees with a safe and healthful workplace and to ensure that operations do not impact neighbors. The Company has provided, and will continue to provide, the human, physical and financial resources necessary to meet this objective.  We expect all employees of the Company to use these resources to make our operations as safe and healthful as is humanly possible.\"\n\nPlanning for accidents, such as that done through RMP, helps to ensure that they never happen.  In fact, our RMP for Terminal 1 reports no harmful accidental releases that affected neighbors over the reportable period of five years.   Hawkins is a leader in national efforts to ensure safe handling of chemicals such as ammonium hydroxide.\n\nReality is, however, that accidents can happen.  That's why continually update mechanical safeguards and invest heavily in training for our employees and our customers.  During the past few years we have made more than $1 million in safety investments at this facility, upgrading the infrastructure by adding cement dikes and improving above-ground storage tanks.  These investments go well beyond Minnesota's particularly stringent regulations for storage facilities.  In fact, Hawkins was the first to comply with the state's progressive regulations.  Future upgrades will include re-grading the entire facility to further ensure that even if an accidental release of a liquid product occurred it would be contained and neutralized.  \n\nIn addition to our internal efforts, safety and emergency response planning also is coordinated with local and national officials, including the St. Paul Fire Department, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and U.S. Coast Guard.  Hawkins also must regularly meet requirements in wastewater, national pollutant discharge (NDPS) and other permits."
