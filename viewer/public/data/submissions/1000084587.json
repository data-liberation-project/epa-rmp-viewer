(Owner) recognizes Safety Management as an essential element in providing a safe and secure place of employment for our associates, the public, and the environment. The corporate core values championed by our owners, embraced by our Senior Leadership, encouraged by our Managers and pledged to our employees are: a) Caring Relationships, b) Entrepreneurial Spirit, c) Strategic Foresight, and d) High Performance. These four core values support our Safety and Health philosophy and management efforts. Interpersonal communications, problem solving, planning and safety achievement have a direct relationship with the core values when applied to safety training, hazard assessment/investigation, post-accident/incident recovery and generating solutions to potential risk exposures. U.S. Venture, Inc. integrates Safety expectations as a part of Managers' responsibilities in order to create a meaningful daily presence during all work activity. All departments at the corporate level including Safety, Human Resources, Finance, Construction and Operations reinforce strategic safety planning and solid operation level decision-making that will reduce risk exposures.\n\n\n\nNacelle Logistics (Operator), recognizes the personal safety and health of each employee of Nacelle Logistics LLC is of primary importance. Prevention of occupationally induced injuries and illnesses is of such consequence that it will be given precedence over operating productivity, whenever necessary. To the greatest degree possible, management will provide all mechanical and physical activities required for personal safety and health, in keeping with the highest standards. We will maintain an occupational safety and health program conforming to the best practices of organizations of this type.

Only through such a cooperative effort, can a safety and health program, in the best interest of all, be established and preserved. Our objective is a safety and health program that will reduce the number of injuries and illnesses to an absolute minimum, not merely in keeping with, but surpassing, the best experience of operations like ours. Our goal is zero accidents and injuries.\n\n\n\nThe Clover Hill RNG Facility is located on a dairy farm in rural Campbellsport, WI.  The facility is a Biogas Processing Facility that stores processed methane, in three high-pressure vessels with the capability of storing 2,916 lbs. of methane each, as well as a tube trailer that can store 5,175 lbs. of produced methane.  These products are transported via truck to a pipeline injection facility. The quantity of methane that is stored onsite exceeds the 10,000-pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements. The facility is typically unmanned, with one to two technicians making daily stops to check on operations, staying onsite for 1-2 hours.\n\n\n\nThe Clover Hill RNG Facility's regulated methane process complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 52 for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Storage and Handling, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes including, WI DSPS, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), and DOT's Hazardous Materials regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Campbellsport, WI Fire Department by calling 911, which may trigger involvement by Fond Du Lac County Emergency Management as necessary.  \n\n\n\nNacelle Logistics has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving methane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event"

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Campbellsport, WI Fire Department and Fond Du Lac County Emergency Management.\n\n\n\nWhen an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged, CMD gas control operations will be notified and a representative will call the Nacelle Logistics on-call personnel in response to confirm whether there is an actual emergency.  If there is no answer from the on-call personnel to confirm whether help is needed, CMD will contact the Nacelle Logistics Operations Manager, and CMD gas control will continue calling personnel listed on the Emergency Action Plan until they are able to speak with somebody in person to communicate the situation.\n\n\n\nOur continuous improvement process, inclusive of historic analytics, risk assessments, and corrective/preventive actions, focuses on three primary objectives: 1) The safety of clients, servicers, and community, 2) Up time performance and user experience and, 3) Site cost drivers and reductions through root cause analysis and long-term corrective and preventive actions.\n\nWhile up-time and site costs goals are easily quantifiable, safety is paramount to U.S. Gain, U.S. Venture and Nacelle Logistics, as this establishes our credibility and reputation with employees, communities, and the industry.  Safety and environmental compliance are always of primary importance.  \n\n\n\nOther planned changes to improve safety include implementing a web based/text based notification system (SCADA) to enhance site visibility at a future date."
