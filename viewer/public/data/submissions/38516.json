It is our policy to adhere to all aplicable state and Federal rules and regulations.  Our main goal is to take steps necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, we have trained personnel and the appropriate equipment to respond to the release and implement control and containment strategies, if they can be implemented without compromising the safety of the team.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA PSM guidelines.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire department and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nBig West Oil LLC's Flying J refinery, located in North Salt Lake, Utah, operates a petroleum refinery whose primary products include gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oil, petroleum wax, kerosene,  propane, butane, and isobutane from raw crude oil.  Regulated flammable substances used or stored on site in quantities exceeding the threshold quantities include butane, isobutane, and propane.  Big West Oil LLC also stores hydrofluoric acid (anhydrous) in quantities exceeding the RMP threshold quantity.\n\n Processes at the refinery regulated by the RMP are also regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Big West Oil LLC's PSM program includes detailed process safety information for each process.  Big West Oil LLC conducts process hazards analyses to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage the hazards.

Changes made to refinery processes are properly managed so all applicable personnel are familiar with the change.\n\nBig West Oil LLC's chemical-specific release prevention systems include temperature, pressure, and flow alarms; and automatic shutdown systems for process parameters such as high level and high temperature.  Tanks and piping are equipped with pressure relief systems that route materials to a knock-out pot and flare.  Bulk storage tanks are located within earthen berms to contain liquid releases, and most are equipped with double bottoms.\n\nBig West Oil LLC has had no accidental releases in the past five years involving a listed chemical that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.\n\nBig West Oil LLC maintains an Emergency Response Action Plan and a Facility Response Plan that describe actions to take in an emergency.  The refinery maintains an inventory of spill response and fire-fighting equipment on site, and the facility maintains hazardous materials and fire brigade crews which train twice a month.  The refinery participates in the Petroleum Mutual Aid Program in which area refineries would assist each other in the event of an emergency.  Big West Oil LLC has also coordinated its emergency response program with the Davis County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\nBIg West Oil LLC continues in its program to equip the bulk petroleum storage tanks with double bottoms.  We have also recently upgraded our fire water system and added additional firefighting equipment."
