      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nWe have adopted this Program in order to implement 40 C.F.R. 68, the federal requirements regulating Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\nOur Program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions of the standard.  We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Pearland believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe City of Pearland has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release.  The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Barry Rose Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.  The sulfur dioxide is below the threshold quantity, therefore it is not regulated under 40 C.F.R. 68, but some of the information is included for employee awareness."

      "SummaryText": "Chemical\tMaximum Inventory (lb)\tThreshold Quantity (lb)\nChlorine\t6,000\t2,500\nSulfur Dioxide\t4,000\t5,000\n\nThe results of the air dispersion model are summarized in the table below along with the estimated population within the impact area. The population data was estimated using the Block Uniform Density Group Method in Landview III, which uses the 1990 U. S. Census data to estimate population.  The public and environmental receptors are listed in Section 8 of this plan.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Pearland has implemented a General Accidental Release Prevention Program to minimize releases.  This Program includes: safety information on the covered chemicals, hazard reviews, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\n \n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have not been any accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe City of Pearland has implemented a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that meets or exceeds the requirements of 40 CFR 68.  It is Pearland\u00bfs philosophy to continually improve the safe working conditions of its employees to minimize accidents and reduce the potential for either an on-site or off-site release.  With this in mind, Pearland is planning on incorporating many of the RMP elements into other areas of the process not covered under 40 CFR 68 to improve the overall safety of the plant.\n\nCompliance Schedule\n\nThe City of Pearland is in the process of addressing the items in the Process Hazard Review and each will be addressed by 1/1/05."
