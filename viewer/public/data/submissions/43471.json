      "SummaryText": "Gehl's Guernsey Farms produces food products at our facility in Germantown, WI.   We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  Similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool raw materials and products at our facility.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nGehl's Guernsey Farms takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system and a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel.\n\nThe Utility Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGehl's Guernsey Farms Germantown facility produces food products for sale to the public.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Germantown facility.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n- Employee Participation Program \n- Process Safety Information \n- Process Hazard Analysis"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the Germantown facility over the past five years that resulted in significant of-site or offsite consequences. \n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency action program has been implemented at the Germantown facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Germantown Fire Department.\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nGehl's Guernsey Farms is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner.  We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective.  We are currently upgrading the ventilation and ammonia detection systems at the facility."
