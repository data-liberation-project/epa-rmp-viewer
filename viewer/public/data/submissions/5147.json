If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department to control any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for the sale to farmers for direct application. This location is a satellite of  the Texline facility. There is a full time employ at this location only during harvest season. The remainder of the year an employee drives to the location several times a week to take inventory, do inspections, and load product as needed. The maximum amount of product stored would be 53000 pounds. The facility has one 12000 gallon storage tank.\n\n The worst case release scenario would be the release of 53000 pounds, the total content of a 12000 gallon storage tank, released as a gas over a 10 minute time period. The distance to the point of dispersion to 200 ppm is 4.0 miles. The alternative release scenario is based on a break in a transfer hose and a failure of the excess flow valves so that the release must be stopped by a manual process. The distance to the point of dispersion to 200 ppm is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program has basically four major components: inventory, inspections, maintenance, and training. Inventory is taken daily to monitor quantity of ammonia. Storage facilities and loading systems are inspected daily to ensure proper working order. All hoses, valves, gauges, piping, and storage tanks receive routine maintenance and are replaced to keep up to date and in proper condition. Employees receive proper training on operational and safety procedures.\n\nDo to the attention placed on safety no reportable accidents have occurred in the last five year period.\n\nEmergency response is coordinated with the local fire department.
