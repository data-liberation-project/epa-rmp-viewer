Also, on site, is a fully equipped exterior, industrial fire brigade, a confined space/high angle rescue team, a HAZMAT/Incident Command team, and trained Incident Commanders.  These teams are regularly drilled to manage firefighting situations, confined space extractions, and chemical release containment.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Geismar Plant is registered to the ISO 14001 international environmental standard and is also an OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star facility. Lion Copolymer's position has been and continues to be one of maintaining the safety of its employees and the general public."

      "SummaryText": "mergency planning and response.\nThe operational readiness of the ERP is maintained through regular drills and exercises, periodic internal reviews, and by incorporating best practices from within the chemical manufacturing industry as appropriate. \nThe facility is also a member of the Ascension Parish CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response) program and Industrial Mutual Aid Group (IMAG).  This organization is part of an on-going effort to maintain communication between industry, the general public, and law enforcement, emergency response and environmental agencies.\n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Geismar Facility handles three RMP chemicals (one toxic and two flammable) with quantities above the regulation threshold.  Whenever possible, chemicals are handled by pipeline to reduce the impact in the event of a leak rather than stock-piling large amounts in storage tanks.  The RMP covered processes are Program 3 processes that include raw material receiving, storage and handling and as such are controlled by all the above-mentioned prevention and emergency response programs.  The chemicals of concern are discussed below.\nTOXIC:  In the Polymers Process, the facility utilizes Alkyl Aluminum, which is regulated under the LDEQ Supplemental List of the Louisiana RMP regulation.  The RMP eSubmit Program does not allow this chemical to be entered; therefore, it is not included in the submittal file.  This chemical is associated with a Program 3 process and is included in the Executive Summary for documentation. \nFLAMMABLE:  Propylene is used as a raw material as well as a refrigerant in the Polymers Process.  A flammable mixture comprised of propylene, ethylene, propane, and ethane is contained in the Polymers Process.  Propylene and ethylene are used as raw materials and are delivered to the facility via pipeline.  Ethane and propane are generated during the reaction process from the ethylene and propylene.\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEA"

The facility began operations in 1962, and Lion Copolymer purchased the facility in June 2007.\n\nREASON FOR RESUBMISSION:\nHistorically, Lion\u0092s facility was not eligible for Program Level 1, due to the existence of a public receptor within the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release. In 2018, Lion terminated the lease of office space within the site, and therefore the Polymers Process was downgraded to RMP/CAPP Program Level 1.\nIn June 2022, REG constructed and began occupying a new guardhouse on Tract A-1-B (as well as started construction of a new office building) which is defined as public receptors under RMP/CAPP regulations.  Offsite Consequence Analyses (OCA) were revalidated and confirmed that these buildings are within the distance to the endpoint for the site\u0092s worst-case release.  Accordingly, this RMP plan was amended to upgrade the facility to Program Level 3 within 6-months as required by regulations.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\nThe facility maintains a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) to guide emergency response operations in the event of a spill or release of a hazardous material or other emergency event, such as a fire, explosion, process upset, property damage, medical incident, severe weather, or breach of security.  The ERP includes the following sections:\n\u0095\tCore emergency procedures\n\u0095\tIndividual procedures for responding to and managing specific types of hazardous conditions or emergencies that may occur at the facility\n\u0095\tChecklists designed for use by the persons that fulfill the positions in the Emergency Operations Center during an incident\n\u0095\tChemical Emergency Response Guidelines for the primary hazardous materials at the facility\n\u0095\tSupplemental resources that can assist in managing and coordinating response to an emergency\n\u0095\tMiscellaneous information supporting e"
