EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nStepan Company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Stepan Company employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Stepan Company has established operations and management systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage chemical risk at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant and complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  One of the requirements associated with the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements associated with the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nStepan Company is committed to the safety of Stepan Company employees, public, and preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Stepan Company implements controls to prevent   releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a chemical release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Stepan Company evaluates each situation, evacuates employees as necessary, and contacts the local fire department to control and contain the release to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  The Millsdale Plant will also contact Will County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) to assist with emergency management if necessary.   \n\nWill County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) has established a Chemical Emergency Preparedness Plan to coordinate emergency response activities and communicate w"

The community is notified of the situation and what action to take via telephone.\n\nStepan Company's Millsdale facility conducts training and practice exercises on a regular basis to assure effectiveness of the emergency response program.\n\n1.2 The Stepan Company and Regulated Substances\n\nStepan Company is a major manufacturer of specialty and intermediate chemicals used in a broad range of industries.  Stepan Company is a leading merchant producer of surfactants that are the key ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning compounds.  Manufacturers of detergents, shampoos, lotions, toothpastes, and cosmetics depend on surfactants to achieve the foaming and cleaning qualities of their products.  Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant handles four (4) substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the regulation.  \n\n        Sulfur trioxide (SO3 ) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the sulfonation processes.  There are five (5) sulfonation processes located at the Millsdale Plant site.  The sulfonation processes receive sulfur trioxide from two (2) bulk storage tanks.  The sulfonation processes manufacture various sulfonic acids which may be sold to customers for the production of detergents and cleaning products, or further processed within Stepan Company.  \n\nSulfur trioxide (SO3 ) is also delivered to the Millsdale Plant via truck for use in the Process Technology Department (PTD).  The PTD uses sulfur trioxide to manufacture various sulfonic acids on a smaller scale than the production processes.  Sulfur trioxide is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule.\n\n        Ethylene oxide (EO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the alkoxylation process.  The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers, used as a raw mater"

Ethylene oxide is classified as a toxic gas in the RMP Rule.\n\n        Propylene oxide (PO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the alkoxylation process.  The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers, used as a raw material for the sulfonation process, or used as a raw material for polymer manufacturing.  Propylene oxide is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule.\n    \n        Aqua Ammonia (27 wt% aqueous solution) is delivered by tank truck, stored on site, and used in the neutralization process to neutralize the sulfonic acid manufactured from the sulfonation process.  Aqua ammonia is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule.\n\nAs a result of the use of regulated substances at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant, the following five (5) processes are covered by the RMP rule.  The inventory of the substances varies during the year.  Table I includes the maximum expected inventory for each regulated substance during the year.\n\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nStepan Company's Millsdale Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substances included in Table I to effect the public or environment.  The OCA consists of both worst case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS).  The WCS represents a release based on catastrophic failure of equipment or piping.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility such as a pipe or hose leak.  Both WCS's and ARS's help the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) improve the community emergency response plan.  The scenarios also assist the Millsdale Plant for emergency response pre-planning.  The WCS and ARS are completed as defined in the RMP rule.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur off-site because of an acc"

Endpoints for toxic and flammable substances are defined in the RMP regulation. \n\nThe toxic endpoint concentrations vary among the covered substances based on potential health effects upon exposure.  The endpoints for flammable substances are defined in terms of overpressure and radiant heat.  The endpoints have been defined to minimize the potential for long term health effects upon exposure.  \n\nThe distances to endpoint are estimated using EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) document and dispersion models.  \n\nThe RMP Rule requires facilities to identify one worst case scenario to represent all the toxic substances and one worst case scenario to represent all the flammable substances.  The RMP Rule also requires submission of an alternative release scenario for each toxic substance and one alternative release scenario to represent all the flammable substances.  Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant does not store or process any flammable substances defined by the RMP Rule.  \n\n        Worst Case Release Scenario (WCS) - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst case scenario for toxic substances at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant is a catastrophic failure of a railcar containing 180,000 pounds of liquid sulfur trioxide (SO3).  The worst case scenario assumes the entire quantity of sulfur trioxide is released in a period of ten (10) minutes.  The resulting chemical release would reach off-site endpoints and public receptors.  As defined by the regulation, the worst case scenario does not consider the presence of emergency interlock systems that will promptly isolate the release, or mitigation by emergency response personnel.   \n\n        The distance to endpoint associated with the WCS was calculated using EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) document.

The hose fails due to railcar pull-away. The scenario assumes that the release will be isolated using the railcar safety interlock system.  Prompt activation of the system is expected because unloading operations are constantly monitored.  The railcar unloading system is also equipped with motion detectors that will isolate sulfur trioxide flow in the event of railcar movement.  The resulting chemical release would reach off-site endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe ARS for ethylene oxide (EO) is the rupture of a 2-inch diameter transfer hose connected to a railcar for ethylene oxide unloading.  The hose fails due to railcar pull-away.  The ethylene oxide rail cars are equipped with excess flow valves.  An excess flow valve is internal to the rail car and stops ethylene oxide flow almost immediately in the event of hose failure. In addition to the excess flow valve, area monitors have been installed to detect airborne concentrations of ethylene oxide, and video cameras monitor the railcar unloading area.  The railcar unloading system is equipped with a safety interlock system.  Dry disconnects are also used for hose connections to minimize the potential for chemical release.

This scenario is not expected to impact an off-site receptor.\n\n    The ARS for aqua ammonia (27 wt% aqueous solution) is the rupture of a 2-inch diameter transfer hose connected to a tank truck.  The hose fails due to truck pull-away.  The scenario assumes employees will detect the release and isolate the line.  Tank truck unloading of aqua ammonia (27 wt% aqueous solution) is constantly monitored.  The truck brakes are set and wheels are chocked prior to initiating transfer. This scenario is not expected to impact an off-site receptor.\n\n        The distance to endpoint for the alternative release scenarios were calculated using the TRACE atmospheric dispersion model developed by SAFER Systems.  TRACE is a comprehensive hazard assessment software tool for analyzing the impact of toxic, flammable, and explosive chemical releases into the atmosphere.  TRACE has the capability to create a thorough and scientifically sound analysis of atmospheric releases.\n \n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant.
