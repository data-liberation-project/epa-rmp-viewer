Brakebush-Grand Prairie uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for the storage areas. Brakebush-Grand Prairie is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of -11.0\" PSIG to a high side of 180 PSIG. The systems maximum intended inventory is 21,776 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\nWorst Case Scenario \nBrakebush-Grand Prairie worst case release is the catastrophic failure of the High-Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system. The maximum capacity of the High-Pressure Receiver is 15286.5 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia at 100% full. The normal operating level in the HPR is 50% or 7643.25 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia. The worst-case scenario takes into account the possibility the vessel would be 80% full, holding 12229 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia. Using the RMP Comp program downloaded from the EPA home page, the calculated endpoint was 1.2 miles down wind. Based on the census data provided the population within the radius of the toxic endpoint is 6474 with 3267 residential housing, in the area. There is no medical center within this area. \nThe worst-case scenario is the catastrophic failure of the High-Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system. The vessel capacity of the High-Pressure Receiver is described above. Although the worst-case scenario is a requirement by the RMP ruling, it is not a likely scenario to take place. Brakebush-Grand Prairie follows the industrial standards to assure proper material is used in the ammonia refrigeration system. By following the industrial standards and the EPA/OSHA standards, the shell failure is unlikely. \nANSI/IIAR-2 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems. \nANSI/ASHRAE 15-1992 Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigerat"

The alternative release was a pressure relief valve function or failure was most likely the cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided, a pressure relief valve release 86.76 lbs./min of ammonia for 10 minutes from the High-Pressure Receiver. The toxic endpoint for the release is .1-mile down wind. The estimated population within the distance would be 0 residents, with residential housing. There are no schools or hospitals in the area. \nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies: \nBrakebush-Grand Prairie has established steps to include initial training under the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an ammonia release. Brakebush-Grand Prairie has also coordinated efforts with the Fire department to establish a joint response program. BBI has on-site Hazmat trained personnel that can implement the Incident Command System to manage the emergency. BBI Hazmat personnel will collaborate with Emergency Responders if assistance is required. BBI will not enter conditions above IDLH (Immediate Dangerous to Life and Health) 300 PPM.   Brakebush-Grand Prairie established plans and procedures are periodically reviewed and at least annually assure that they are current and up to date.

The refrigeration operators receive training on the ammonia system when there is a change in the system and at minimum of every three years. Brakebush-Grand Prairie has also trained personnel in the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Program, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine by the risk assessment the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be simply tightening a packing nut or a flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. Brakebush-Grand Prairie has established a written operating procedure for the ammonia system and has included in the procedure the emergency shutdown and isolation in the event of a release. The in-house HAZMAT Team will coordinate their efforts with the outside Emergency Services to assure safety for all personnel. Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases in the past five years. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps: OSHA Process Safety Management EPA Risk Management Program OSHA HAZWOPER Program ASME Boiler and Pressure Valve Codes ANSI B31.3 Piping Code IIAR Industry Guideline for Safety and Good Engineering Practices NFPA Guidelines for Fire Protection Equipment Brakebush-Grand Prairie through regular audits, training, maintenance, testing, and inspection programs has established a history of safe operation and that the community emergency action plans are current and in place. Also, that training with community services has been done and is ongoing. This is to ensure that in the event of an accidental release, Brakebush-Grand Prairie trained personnel and the community emergency services can minimize the release and stop it with no impact to the employees or the community."
