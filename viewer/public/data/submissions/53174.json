This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nEnterprise Products Operating, LP operates a hydrocarbon liquid storage facility (Facility) located at 2610 S. Mohawk Road, Hutchinson, Kansas.  The facility handles propane, butanes, pentanes and refinery grade mixed butanes (RGB).   All products are delivered to the Facility by truck, railcar, or pipeline and offloaded into underground storage caverns and storage tanks.  These products are likewise distributed from the storage facility by transport trucks, railcars and pipeline to wholesale customers.  The Facility contains one Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulated process; hydrocarbon storage and terminal operations.  Ethyl mercaptan is present on the site for use as a propane odorant, but is stored below the threshold quantity.   No other RMP regulated flammables or toxic substances other than those noted above are handled at the Facility.  \n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summ"

The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the plant\u00bfs PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \u00bfnear-miss\u00bf reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Hutchinson Storage Facility has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team id"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Hutchinson Storage Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.

Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Hutchinson Storage Facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in pipeline, storage, propane dehydration and terminal operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Hutchinson Storage Facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to insure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Hutchinson Storage Facility has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Hutchinson Storage Facility has safe work practices in place to help insure worker and process safety.
