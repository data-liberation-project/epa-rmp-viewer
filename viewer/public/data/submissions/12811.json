We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces aluminum using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  An integral part of our aluminum processing is demagging. Demagging is one of the very few techniques for refining aluminum.  Demagging allows the removal of magnesium from the molten bath by treating the bath with either a fluoride salt or chlorine.  Demagging of aluminum at our facility is accomplished through the injection of chlorine into the molten aluminum.  Other than chlorine, we use no other chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  The site does store diesel fuel.  \n\nToxics\nChlorine -- 20,000 lb (stored in 1 ton cylinders) \n\n\nFlammables\nDiesel Fuel -"

Typically 15,000 gallons are stored at any given time.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nOur Worst-Case Sscenario consists of the release of the total contents of a 2,000 lb cylinder in ten minutes.  Our Worst-Case Scenario is based on methods prescribed by EPA in its RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Our release scenario includes the formation of a chlorine vapor cloud as a result of the cylinder rupture.  We used the US EPA Lookup Tables and RMPlanner software from ABS Group, Risk and Reliability Division (formerly JBF Associates) to calculate the distance to 1psi overpressure.  The resulting vapor cloud in the case of our worst case scenario would have offsite consequences extending approximately 4.5 miles from the release source.  Based on data from the 1990 US Census and using LandView III software from the US Bureau of Census, we estimate approximately 6,900 people reside within that distance.  With growth in the Steele area since the 1990 Census, the current population may be greater.  Within that radius are residences and other businesses.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nOur Alternative Release Scenario consists of the release of 1,008 lb over a sixty (60) minute period.  We chose an Alternative Release Scenario whereby a 1/4\", type K stainless tubing used for "

This selection was based  on the opinion of management and the opinion of plant personnel that operate the process on a daily basis.  The basis for the assumption is the Guidance Document \"Generic Risk Management Plan For Chlorine\", Edition 1 dated April 1998.  This document was prepared by the Chlorine Institute.  Within the publication the reader has ten (I through X) scenarios from which to pick.  We chose scenario VII in that we felt Scenario VII is the most reasonable alternative scenario for the Culp facility.  Our Alternative Release Scenario includes the formation of a chlorine vapor cloud as a result of the tube failure.  We used the US EPA Lookup Tables and RMPlanner software from ABS Group, Risk and Reliability Division (formerly JBF Associates) to calculate the distance to 1psi overpressure.  The resulting vapor cloud in the case of our alternative case scenario would have offsite consequences extending approximately .37 miles (1950 ft) from the release source.  Based on data from the 1990 US Census and using LandView III software from the US Bureau of Census, we estimate approximately 136 people reside within that distance.

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nJune 16, 1998\n\nThe employee stated that he was observing his Supervisor change the Chlorine Tube at the metal pump.  He inhaled some residual Chlorine that had escaped from the line.\n\nMay 12, 1998\n\nThe employee stated that he was tapping metal out of #2 Reverb Furnace.  He said that he inhaled some chlorine that was leaking from a nipple valve.\n\nFebruary 13, 1998 *\n\nMolten metal ran over the lip of #2 Reverb Furnace pump.  The metal contacted the Chlorine line and burned a hole in the line.\n\nJanuary 20, 1998 *\n\nMolten metal ran over the lip of #1 Reverb Furnace pump well.  The metal contacted the Chlorine line and burned a hole in the line.\n\nJanuary 9, 1998*\n\nTrough burner line had a large hole in it and the flame contacted the Chlorine line for a period of time (undetermined).  When discovered, the chlorine line was glowing red.  Chlorine system was shut off.  Soon after, line ru"

He says the tube broke and the Chlorine line fell to the floor.  He inhaled some Chlorine while attempting to put the line back into the pump.\n\nOctober 5, 1996\n\nThe employee stated he was changing the Chlorine system from the right tank to the left tank because the right tank was empty.  He said that when he opened the valve on the full tank the line connecting the tank to the system was not properly sealed.  This allowed chlorine to spray out from the line and he inhaled some of the fumes.\n\nMarch 6, 1996\n\nThe employee stated he was changing the pump in #2 Reverb Furnace, putting the hose on to the pump line.  The hose hit the Chlorine lever, causing it to open, and he inhaled some fumes.\n\nJanuary 18, 1995\n\nThe employee stated that he was changing the Chlorine tank.  He inhaled some Chlorine when a small amount leaked out of the Chlorine line when he disconnected it.\n\n\n* For each of these incidents, we have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
