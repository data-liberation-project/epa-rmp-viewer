      "SummaryText": "The Massillon Product Supply Center is a food distribution warehouse that contains refrigerated areas for perishable items.  The refrigerated areas of the warehouse are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available.  However, the properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\n\nThe Massillon Product Supply Center has opted to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The amount of ammonia estimated to be contained inside the refrigeration system is 11,000 pounds.\n\nThe Massillon Product Supply Center complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR).  The operators are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program does not guarantee against an accidental release.  An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The worst case scenario considered the loss of the total charge of 11,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system over a 10-minute period.  The ammonia release could travel approximately 1.9 miles (3,344 yards or 10,032 feet).  There are approximately 5,686 residents within the potentially affected area.  There are other public receptors (schools and industrial/commercial buildings) in the potentially affected area but no environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternati"

      "SummaryText": "ve release scenario, which is the most likely scenario, considered a release of ammonia from a broken line.  A release of 2,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period was considered.  It was determined that a release could travel approximately 364 yards (1,092 feet).  There are approximately 150 residents and public receptors (industrial/commercial buildings) in the potentially affected area.\n\nNo administrative controls or mitigation measures were used to limit the chemical release distances for either scenario.\n\nThe Massillon Product Supply Center has an established Emergency Response Plan to respond to emergencies.  The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 Emergency Response Plan.  The plan requires Fleming associates to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area.  The emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency.  The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors.  Fleming maintenance associates will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency.  The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and utility outages.\n\nThis location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years."
