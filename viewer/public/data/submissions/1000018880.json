Enterprise Products Operating LLC, which operates the facility, is committed to operating and maintaining it in a manner that is safe for our employees and the environment.  Contractors and employees will be involved in all design, installation, operation and mantenance of our equipment.  The plant will focus on process safety, which is to be implemented in safety policies, practices and procedures designed to safely handle the hazardous substances present at the facility.  The facility is a member of a site-wide Emergency Response Team that includes fire, rescue, medical and environmental response.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Enterprise Products purity isobutylene and terminal facility receives a mixture of C-4 olefins and saturates (alkene and alkane hrocarbon raffinate) stream by pipeline, rail, truck or barge.  An alternate isobutane/isobutylene mixture may also be received for processing.  The feed is stored, then processed in a proprietary separation and fractionation process to recover a high purity isobutylene product from the feed.  An olefin or primarily isobutane product is also producted depending upon the feed used.  The purity isobutylene and other products are removed from the facility again by pipeline, rail, truck or barge depending upon the purchaser. The facility includes a barge dock and terminal storage tanks to receive and store refined products on a third-party contract basis.  An olefin product similar to one of the facility feedstocks may be stored from time to time.  Other products stored are fuels, lubricating oils and inorganic chemicals not covered by the RMP Rule.\n\nRegulated Substances  \n\nToxics\n\nAn aqueos ammonia chemical is stored and used for "

A second isobutane/isobutylene stream may also be received and stored for processing.  Two byproduct flammable mixtures, similar to the feeds, are prduced in the high purity isobutylene plant.  The plant produces a high purity isobutylene product from either feedstock.  The terminal stores a mixed olefin product similar to the plant feed on a third party contract storage basis.  \n\nOur accidental release prevention program and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  This data is in the corresponding RMP data fields of the RMP registration.\n\nThis information is used  to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nEnterprise Products takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  The Process Safety Management systems address each of the key features of a successful prevention program, including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - \"PSSR\"\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permit\n* Contractors\n\nAs a part of the prevention efforts, there are many programs in which Enterprise employees participate.

Employees are trained on, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\nThere is an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies with the process equipment prior to any incident.\n\nThe Operations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no incidents at the Pruity Isobutylene Plant and Pasadena Product Handling Terminal involving hazardous chemicals covered by the RMP rule that resulted in inury, death, significant on-site property damage,or off-site consequences. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Padadena LEPC which includes the local police and fire departments.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that are planned for implementation at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n* Enterprise is currently reviewing and revising the entire safety m"
