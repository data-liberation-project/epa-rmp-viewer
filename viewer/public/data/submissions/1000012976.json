All applicable procedures of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  Metalor's (formerly AMI Doduco) emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA emergency response requirements.\n\nThe Metalor (formerly AMI Doduco)(PR) manufacturing facility located at Road 992, km 0.3, Lot #2 Luquillo, PR has two (2) aboveground storage tanks (10,000 gallons and 8,000 gallons) located on the south side of the facility that are used to store liquefied anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, when needed, a portable ammonia storage tank that is approximately 6,500 gallons in capacity is also attached to the system.\n\nIt should be noted that when the portable storage tank is attached, the volume stored in the other two storage tanks is typically reduced.  However, for an estimated maximum on-site inventory, it is assumed that all three ASTs are at 85% capacity, resulting in 108,500 lbs of anhydrous ammonia on-site (assuming a density of 5.15 lb/gallon).\n\nThe liquefied ammonia is \"cracked\" using three high temperature dissociator units.  As the ammonia vapors pass through an electrically heated retort, heated to 1750 oF, and over a nickel catalyst, the ammonia is \"cracked\" into a mixture of 75% hydrogen and 25% nitrogen.  The \"cracked\" ammonia is dried before entering individual electric furnaces where it creates a reducing internal furnace atmosphere.  \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 0.14 mg/l, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level-2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined as t"

This program includes an emergency response and notification plan.  Emergency response drills and/or evaluations are conducted annually.  Emergency operations and response procedures are also reviewed at this time.\n\nNo changes to improve safety were identified in an OSHA Process Safety Program completed for the facility."
