      "SummaryText": "Don Miguel Mexican Foods of Dallas, Texas prepares foods which are cooked and frozen for storage and shipment to retail vendors.   One of the refrigerants used is anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system includes two machinery rooms for flash freezers and storage areas.  The facility has been in operation since 1998 and in 2006 the plant expansion resulted in having more than 10,000 lbs ammonia in the processes.     \n\n\n\nThe persons working at the plant consist of employees and a significant number of contract employees.   A sanitation firm provides approximately 200 contract employees.  Furthermore, typically 100 to 200 contract employees are used in food processing areas.    \n\n\n\nThe ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  Ammonia as contained in equipment in the facility is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal, State, and local laws, statutes, codes, rules, and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since the facility increased the ammonia on site above the 10,000 lb threshold. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia R"

These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. \n\n\n\nThe Manager of Plant Engineering is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \n\n\n\nB.

The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\n? Operating Procedures: \n\nWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  These SOPs were converted to the IIAR format in 2015.  \n\n? Training Program: \n\nAn operator training program is designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.  \n\n? Contractor Safety Program: \n\nContractors that are used to work on or adjacent to the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\n? Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures: \n\nSee comments under Management of Change  \n\n?
