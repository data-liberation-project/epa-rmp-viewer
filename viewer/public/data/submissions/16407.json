      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Gudalupe-Blanco River Authority has operated the Victoria Regional Wastewater Plant since 1972 without a reportable release of any hazardous substance. Two hazardous chemicals are used at the plant in sufficient quantities to require compliance with the rules: thes are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant, while sulfur dioxide is used as a dechlorinating agent.\n\nGBRA recognizes the need for care in the handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Chlorine handling has been addresssed in the GBRA Safety Manual, the Job Safety Analysis, the Emergency Operations Plan, the preventive maintenance program and the annual safety audit. Training has been conducted annually with advanced training occuring every two years. Training is conducted on proctice containers purchased for this specific purpose. Leak detection systems are located at the Victoria Regional Plant that activated an audible and visible alarm at the plant site. Personnel called out to repair a leak have access to a hazardous chemical response trailer with the necesary safety gear and repair kits needed to repair a leak. \n\nEven with all of the care currenly provided, the completion of the Risk Management Plan  demonstrates the need for some improvements. GBRA will have mock drills that include the Victoria Fire Department, and other response personnel. The Compliance Audit Checklist will be added to the annual safety audit. Addtionally items defined in the Hazard Review Cheklist that require attention will be corrected.\n\nThe worst case scenario is 1.9 miles for chlorine and 2.1 miles for sulfur dioxide. The impact of this is to a largely rural but wooded terrain located in the flood plain of the Guadalupe River. The Victoria Regional Plant is manned 24 hours and thus will be able to respond in a resonable time frame to a leak should it occur.\n\nThe alternative release scenario's a and b are for 1.5 and 1.2 miles respectively. These scenarios do not assume that repa"
