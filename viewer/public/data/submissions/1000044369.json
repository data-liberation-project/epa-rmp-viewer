The Facility Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe owners, management, and employees of Premier Ag, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The Facility and the Regulated Substance(s) Handled\nThis facility is a retail farm supply center and handles a variety of farm supplies, including dry and liquid fertilizers, crop protection products, seed, and other related agricultural inputs.  This facility is a retailer of anhydrous ammonia, a product regulated by U. S. EPA.  We receive anhydrous ammonia by truck, store that product on-site in two 12,000 gallon storage tanks and then distribute the product to our customers in 1,000 gallon and 1,450 gallon nurse tanks.  The only processes related to anhydrous ammonia at this location are using a liquid pump to move the product from the delivery truck into the storage tank, and then using a liquid pump to move the product from the storage tank into the 1,000 gallon and 1,450 gallon nurse tanks. \n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific\n   Prevention Steps\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. This facility also complies with the standards of the U. S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Additional information is contained in our \"Safety and Environmental Manual\".  Other steps used to prevent the accidental release of ammonia include routine safety and maintenance inspections, employee training, a"

The Five Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility or, to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\nThis facility has a written Emergency Response Plan, in accordance with OSHA standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120.  We also have provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  All employees receive on-going training related to safe handling procedures for ammonia, equipment maintenance, and personal protective equipment requirements.  All employees are also prepared to implement the Emergency Response Plan as outlined for the facility.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility.  Periodic inspections and checklists are performed to assess the maintenance and safety conditions of all components in the ammonia handling process.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
