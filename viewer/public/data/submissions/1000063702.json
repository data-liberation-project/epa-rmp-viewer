Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sunview Cold Storage - Earlimart has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Sunview Cold Storage - Earlimart, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sunview Cold Storage - Earlimart has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n\n\n(2) Precoolers\n\n(8) Rooms\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\n\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room.

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the ammonia diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\nThere is an ammonia detector installed inside the refrigeration machinery room. The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm. Also, each refrigerated room is equipped with a standalone ammonia detector set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm.\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on the east exterior wall of the refrigeration machinery room, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to the diffusion tank. The connecting pipe between the high and low sid"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nSunview Cold Storage - Earlimart has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sunview Cold Storage - Earlimart facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 22,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nSunview Cold Storage - Earlimart has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 "
