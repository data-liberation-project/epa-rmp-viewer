      "SummaryText": "Dalton Utilities' Risk Management PLan for safe Chlorine Handling involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases.  All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.  The Mill Creek Water Plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect raw water taken from Mill Creek.  The chlorination process includes chlorination cylinders, chlorination equipment, instrumentation, electrical controls and process specific safety equipment.  Modeling was performed utilizing EPA's RMP*COMP (TM) software to identify potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in accidental chlorine releases.  The Dalton Utilities' RMP is supported by operator training, preventative maintenance, process specific safety equipment, safe and effective standard operating procedures, periodic hazard review and a continual audit and inspection program.  Emergency response drills, drill evaluations and facility tours are conducted annually, at which time emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed.  Dalton Utilities takes a proactive approach to risk management and emergency response.  Effective standard operating procedures, along with mitigation measures coordinated with local response agencies, will provide for the safe operation of the chlorination process needed for treatment of the communities' valued water supply."
