Whenever required information was not available, we obtained the information from equipment vendors, process designers, plant engineering, and/or research and development departments.  In conjunction with our equipment information collection efforts, we documented that our equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  For our older processes, where design information is obsolete, our Engineering Department evaluated the existing design against appropriate safety criteria and documented that the equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\r\n\r\n-Process Hazards Analysis (PHA)- We conduct systematic PHA's of our regulated processes and other hazardous processes at our facility according to an established schedule.  This schedule ensures that we (1) address each process in a prioritized order (based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees and/or offsite population, the age of the process, and the operating history of the process) and (2) update/revalidate each PHA at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes).

PHA's are implemented in a written report for each analysis soon after the analysis meetings are completed.  Our managers review and resolve the PHA recommendations after receiving the report.  We maintain a written action plan tracking the resolution status of each recommendation, including an individual responsible for resolving each recommendation and a target completion date. \r\n\r\n-Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)- Our process engineers, operators, and shift supervisors work together to develop and maintain our operating procedures for all phases of operations including:\r\n\r\no Initial startup\r\no Normal operations\r\no Temporary operations\r\no Emergency shutdown, including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required and assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\r\no Emergency operations\r\no Normal shutdown\r\no Startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown\r\n\r\nOur development teams use PSI, information from process designers/equipment manufacturers, and their own experience to create and validate the procedures. \r\n\r\nOur procedures address the following information:\r\n\r\no Steps for safely conducting activities \r\no Safe operating limits\r\no Consequences of process deviations, as well as steps required to correct or avoid such deviations\r\no Safety and health considerations including (1) properties of, and hazards presented by, the chemicals used in the process, (2) precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineerin"

We provide initial training to new hires or newly assigned employees before they are allowed to work independently as operators.\r\n\r\nPeriodically, at least every three years, we provide our operators with refresher training that, depending on job classification, can include operating procedure training, equipment-specific training, and/or advanced chemical-specific training. Our refresher training courses emphasize process overview information, safe work practices, operating procedures that are rarely used such as emergency shutdown, emergency operation and startup following an emergency shutdown, and any operating issues requested by the shift group.  \r\n\r\nAll training is accompanied by some form of evaluation to verify that our training has been understood.

This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return deteriorated equipment to acceptable specifications.\r\n  \r\nWe identify equipment deficiencies through our inspection, test, and preventive maintenance activities or from routine operating and maintenance tasks and correct them promptly.  If we cannot immediately correct identified equipment deficiencies, we implement protective measures to ensure safe operation until repairs can be made.  All inspections and preventive maintenance activities are documented.\r\n\r\n-Pre-Startup Review - We perform pre-startup reviews on new stationary sources and on modified stationary sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  Our pre-startup review is completed before regulated substances are brought into the process and only after we have confirmed that:\r\n\r\no Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\r\no Safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate \r\no PHA's have been performed on new stationary sources and all recommendations have been resolved\r\no Management of Change (MOC) requirements have been satisfied for modified processes\r\no Training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees\r\n\r\nWe use a Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist as an aid in documenting the performance of our pre-startup reviews.

All reviewers must sign off on the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist before startup can be authorized.\r\n\r\n-Compliance Audits - We conduct and certify compliance audits of the prevention programs for RMP-covered processes at least every three years.  We integrate these audits into PSM audits.  Our audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the size and complexity of the processes to be audited.    \r\n\r\nOur audit team members use a protocol or a check-sheet that contains a series of questions that systematically address each requirement of the RMP regulation.  The team leader assigns each auditor specific RMP elements to cover in the audit.  Information obtained through field observations, interviews, and document reviews is documented, and weaknesses or noncompliances are identified.  At the conclusion of the audit, our audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.  Plant management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and assigns a target completion date.  The corrective actions are placed in a tracking system and progress is monitored quarterly until open issues are resolved.

From the raw data collected, the incident investigation team prepares the text for an incident summary report, which contains:\r\n\r\no Date and time of the event\r\no Date and time the investigation started\r\no Description of the event\r\no Identification of contributing factors\r\no Recommendations from the investigation\r\n\r\nWe resolve the report recommendations and develop action plans that are tracked to completion. We review the incident investigation report and action plan items with employees (and contract employees, as appropriate) who work in the affected area and/or perform job tasks relevant to the investigation findings. We accomplish this review by discussing the event at the next safety meeting.  We retain incident reports for at least five years.\r\n\r\n-Employee Participation - We have a written employee participation program that meets RMP requirements.  In this document, we describe in detail the many different ways that employees participate in each element of the RMP regulations. We periodically update this document as changes occur.\r\n\r\nWe consult with the employees on ways to improve participation in the RMP.

We also created a Safe Work Permit Form to document job requirements, the dates for the hot work, and the object on which the work is to be performed.  We distributed the Hot Work Procedure and Safe Work Permit Forms to employees in safety meetings and used a workshop approach to train all employees who may use or enforce a hot work permit activity. New employees are trained on the hot work permit procedure as part of the safe work practices orientation.  The HS&E Department periodically audits completed Safe Work Permit Forms to ensure that any errors in preparation or approval are identified and brought to the attention of those involved to prevent recurrence.\r\n\r\n-Contractor Safety Programs - We have a detailed contractor safety program that applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to an RMP-covered process.  This program does not apply to contractors providing incidental services that do not influence process safety.\r\n\r\nWe select contractors based on prior site work history and on information that they are required to provide as part of the bid process.  The bid information includes their current safety programs (i.e., safety organization, employee education and training, and accident prevention program) and their prior safety performance (i.e., OSHA injury rates, property loss experience, regulatory compliance history, and worker's compensation insurance experience).  Bidders that do not provide all of the requested information, that do not have the desired skills, or that have an unsatisfactory safety record are dropped from further consideration.  Contractors that meet the minimum safety requirements are then judged on whom can do a quality job at the lowest cost.  \r\n\r\nWe provide a safety orientation for Contractors before they begin work on site.
