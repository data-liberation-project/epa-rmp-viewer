Whenever required information was not available, we obtained the information from equipment vendors, process designers, plant engineering, and/or research and development departments.  In conjunction with our equipment information collection efforts, we documented that our equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  For our older processes, where design information is obsolete, our Engineering Department evaluated the existing design against appropriate safety criteria and documented that the equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\n\n\n-Process Hazards Analysis (PHA)- We conduct systematic PHA's of our regulated processes and other hazardous processes at our facility according to an established schedule.  This schedule ensures that we (1) address each process in a prioritized order (based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees and/or offsite population, the age of the process, and the operating history of the process) and (2) update/revalidate each PHA at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes).

We maintain a written action plan tracking the resolution status of each recommendation, including an individual responsible for resolving each recommendation and a target completion date. \n\n\n\n-Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)- Our process engineers, operators, and shift supervisors work together to develop and maintain our operating procedures for all phases of operations including:\n\n\n\no Initial startup\n\no Normal operations\n\no Temporary operations\n\no Emergency shutdown, including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required and assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n\no Emergency operations\n\no Normal shutdown\n\no Startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown\n\n\n\nOur development teams use PSI, information from process designers/equipment manufacturers, and their own experience to create and validate the procedures. \n\n\n\nOur procedures address the following information:\n\n\n\no Steps for safely conducting activities \n\no Safe operating limits\n\no Consequences of process deviations, as well as steps required to correct or avoid such deviations\n\no Safety and health considerations including (1) properties of, and hazards presented by, the chemicals used in the process, (2) precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineerin"

We provide initial training to new hires or newly assigned employees before they are allowed to work independently as operators.\n\n\n\nPeriodically, at least every three years, we provide our operators with refresher training that, depending on job classification, can include operating procedure training, equipment-specific training, and/or advanced chemical-specific training. Our refresher training courses emphasize process overview information, safe work practices, operating procedures that are rarely used such as emergency shutdown, emergency operation and startup following an emergency shutdown, and any operating issues requested by the shift group.  \n\n\n\nAll training is accompanied by some form of evaluation to verify that our training has been understood.

This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return deteriorated equipment to acceptable specifications.\n\n  \n\nWe identify equipment deficiencies through our inspection, test, and preventive maintenance activities or from routine operating and maintenance tasks and correct them promptly.  If we cannot immediately correct identified equipment deficiencies, we implement protective measures to ensure safe operation until repairs can be made.  All inspections and preventive maintenance activities are documented.\n\n\n\n-Pre-Startup Review - We perform pre-startup reviews on new stationary sources and on modified stationary sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.

All reviewers must sign off on the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist before startup can be authorized.\n\n\n\n-Compliance Audits - We conduct and certify compliance audits of the prevention programs for RMP-covered processes at least every three years.  We integrate these audits into PSM audits.  Our audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the size and complexity of the processes to be audited.    \n\n\n\nOur audit team members use a protocol or a check-sheet that contains a series of questions that systematically address each requirement of the RMP regulation.  The team leader assigns each auditor specific RMP elements to cover in the audit.  Information obtained through field observations, interviews, and document reviews is documented, and weaknesses or noncompliances are identified.  At the conclusion of the audit, our audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.  Plant management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and assigns a target completion date.  The corrective actions are placed in a tracking system and progress is monitored quarterly until open issues are resolved.

New employees are trained on the hot work permit procedure as part of the safe work practices orientation.
