              "Description": "The waste water treatment plant located in Auburn Indiana uses chlorine as a disinfectant in treating municipal waste water.  Chlorine gas is mixed with water and distributed throughout the waste water flow in the chlorine contact tank at two separate treatment facilities referred to as Plant 1 and Plant 2.  Chlorine injection equipment uses an eductor to create a vacuum to pull chlorine gas from the chlorine feeder.  In the event of a break in the chlorine feed line or a malfunction of the system, vacuum would be lost and the chlorine feeder would shut off flow of chlorine gas.  An alarm system with chlorine sensors located in areas where a leak would potentially cause a hazard is used to warn employees of high chlorine levels.  Chlorine cylinders are in separate rooms in the process control buildings.  Although these rooms are not sealed from release of a leak to the atmosphere, they would minimize damage to the surrounding area and personnel.",
