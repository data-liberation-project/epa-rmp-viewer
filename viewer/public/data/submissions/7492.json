      "SummaryText": "a. The City of Pembroke Pines Utility Department accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed.  The City of Pembroke Pines Utilities Department is included in the Emergency Response Plan for District XI Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The emergency response policy includes this plan, and procedures for evaluating and mitigating minor on-site releases.  The response policy is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb. The City of Pembroke Pines Water Treatment Plant includes a chlorination system, which serves to disinfect the water supply for the City of Pembroke Pines.  The system delivers chlorine from one-ton liquid chlorine containers through vacuum-type chlorinators.  A vacuum-type chlorinator has a built-in automatic system shut-down in the event of a vacuum pipe leak, thereby minimizing the amount of chlorine released to the atmosphere.  Pressurized lines of the system are limited to flexible connections (pigtails) on the one-ton containers and a short run of carbon steel piping.  The chlorination system is housed in a chlorination room and an instrument room, and includes a flow meter, electrical panels, and safety equipment.  A total of  twenty, one-ton containers of chlorine may be on-site at any one time; however, only four, one-ton containers are on-line at any one time.  A utility shift supervisor and an operator typically are responsible for all plant operations.  The facility is staffed 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nc. The off-site consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative scenario.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the \u0005 maximum quantity in the largest"

      "SummaryText": "vessel \u0005 is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The worst case release scenario is release of the 2,000 pounds from a one-ton cylinder.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  The alternative release scenario is vapor release of chlorine through a small hole, possibly caused by the shearing off of a valve at the top of the container.\n\nNo administrative controls or mitigation measures are considered for limiting the distances for each reported scenario. \n\nd. The general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n7 High level of training of the operators\n7 Preventive maintenance program\n7 Use of state-of-the art process and safety equipment\n7 Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n7 Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n7 Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the following:  use of vacuum-type chlorinators and vacuum piping which provide automatic shut-down and minimize the amount of chlorine released in the event of a vacuum pipe leak;operators make readily available both self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and personal emergency escape breathing apparatus during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply; operators are aware of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine; and, a chlorine detector is located in the chlorination room.\n\ne. No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf. The facility is included in the Emergency Response Plan for District XI Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), as prepared for the South Florida Regional Planning Council.\n\ng. Changes to improve safety have been recommended as a result of the most recent hazard review, conducted as part of this RMP.  These changes are currently being evaluated."
