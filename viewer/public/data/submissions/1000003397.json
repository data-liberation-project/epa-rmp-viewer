The Davenport Plant has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system that uses weekly batched data to track training and inspection dates and issues reminders to responsible groups.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage for the plant during the continual 24 hrs and 7 day plant operations.   The Davenport Fire Department is contacted in the event of an emergency and is trained in paramedical services.  The Davenport Facility also has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  Selected employees have completed 24 hours of formal emergency response training.  These employees are considered Hazardous Material Technicians.\r\n\r\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\r\n\r\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Kraft FoodsA\u00bf Davenport, IA plant manufactures or produces meat products.  The NAICS code for the primary process at this facility is 311612.  \r\n\r\nThis facility is capable of producing and packaging various Bologna, ham, turkey, chicken, and pork products for consumer intake.  Many areas of the plant are equipped with refrigeration systems to preserve the meat products.  Some of these areas include: coolers,  and chill cells.  \r\n\r\nKraft Foods has one regulated substance, ammonia, under 40 CFR 68 at the Davenport Plant.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the plants cooling systems.   The total ammonia charge, at the Davenport Plant, is approximately 100,109 pounds. Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to Kraft Foods in Davenport. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially  effect on-site employees and the gener"

      "SummaryText": "al off-site public if there is a release from the ammonia system.  Although the alternative release scenario is more likely, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario be reported for each regulated chemical.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia \r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\r\n\r\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\r\n\r\n1. Irritation of respiratory tract,\r\n2. Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\r\n3. Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Davenport Plant has established an OSHA PSM Program for the ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, KraftA\u00bfs ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\r\n\r\n1. The Davenport Plant maintains good training, programs, employee awareness, and operating procedures.  An annual Ammonia Mock Spill Drill occurs for emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\n2. Additional guarding for the ammonia pipelines, located within the facility, has been installed.  The guarding consists of concrete retaining curbing"

The database list contains the completed, activated, and on-going tasks at the plant.  Each task contains a job description with instructions and parts required to perform the specified maintenance procedures.  The maintenance procedures can be updated weekly in the Electronic Database as needed.\r\n\r\n4. We also monitor and track contractors performance and safety records.   This allows plant personnel to identify potential concerns with contractors awareness and knowledge of the ammonia process.\r\n\r\n5.0 Ten-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: March 2002 - March 2012.  There have been no releases at this facility as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.42(a).\r\n\r\n\r\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Davenport plant has developed an emergency response plan.  The emergency response program is comprised of 19 different sections that pertain to a proper response for the Davenport facility.  The emergency response plan sections include 1. HAZWOPR, 2. SPCC, 3. Fire Response, 4. Ammonia Release, 5. Bomb Threat, 6. Severe Weather, 7. Power Failure, 8. Evacuation, 9. Unit Managers, 10. Names of trained responsders, 11. First Aid Responders, 12.

Confined Space Program, 19. Flood and Flash Flood Plan.  The combination of these 19 different documents yields a comprehensive Emergency Response Program.  Each section goes into detail about specifics needed for a proper response.\r\n\r\nThe Emeregency Response team meets monthly to discuss updates to the emergency response plan.
