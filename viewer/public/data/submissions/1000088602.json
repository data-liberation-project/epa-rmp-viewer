The plant site is approximately 150 acres in size. (Note: The fenced area is less.)\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are documented in the Aux Sable Emergency Response Plan (ERP) Manual. ASLP takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered process and the safe handling of regulated chemicals. As for emergency response, ASLP has established and maintained site-specific procedures for emergency notification and response. These procedures are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur. ASLP understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may affect the surrounding community. \n\n \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n \n\nThe ASLP LP facility is a natural gas liquids processing plant. The natural gas liquids plant removes commercial grade ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and a pentanes plus product (condensate) from the natural gas stream being transported by Alliance Pipeline L.P. The facility produces and/or stores quantities of propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane, ethyl mercaptan and multiple flammable mixtures including a pentanes plus liquid (composed of butane, iso-butane, pentane, and iso-pentane) in excess of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold planning quantities for flammable substances.

The prevention program elements are described in detail below:\n\n \n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nASLP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Employee participation activities range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant RMP prevention program. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nASLP maintains a variety of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The information is constantly updated to maintain up-to-date process safety information for the plant. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). ASLP ensures that the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nASLP has conducted Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to ensure that hazards associated with the various process units at the plant are identified and controlled. Within the PHA, each unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are "

The HAZOP methodology utilizes a systematic nodal approach conducted by a team of people with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise to assess potential process deviations and associated risks.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nASLP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, ASLP has developed a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators will periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nASLP may use contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, ASLP periodically evaluates contractor safety performance. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nASLP conducts a PSSR for any new unit or unit modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides a final check to ensure (1) that all construction and equipment satisfies design specifications and (2) that all safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness prior to startup of the process. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nASLP has developed practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Affected process safety information and procedures are updated, as required, to incorporate the changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change prior to start-up of the affected process. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nASLP promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, environmental loss, and/or injury or death to persons onsite or offsite. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked and promptly resolved.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA re-validations.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nASLP has a hot work permit program that requires that all hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process be documented and approved prior to initiation of the work.

ASLP has established and coordinated emergency response action plans with the Village of Minooka Fire Department and the Grundy County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The emergency response plan also includes procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies, if a release occurs.  \n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials at the plant meeting the five-year accident history requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\n\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards. Additionally, process hazard analyses are conducted with key employees to meet the RMP requirements. During these sessions, recommendations are made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases. Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise provides all affected employees direct input into safety improvements for the covered process.\n\n"
