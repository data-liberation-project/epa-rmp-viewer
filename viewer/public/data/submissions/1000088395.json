      "SummaryText": "The wastewater treatment plant is located east of SH 198 near Payne Springs, Henderson County, Texas.  Facilities are in place to store several 150-lb bottles of chlorine for treatment of discharge effluent.  Discharge from the South Wastewater Treatment Plant is regulated by TPDES Permit No. WQ0013874001.  Chlorine is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The properties of chlorine which make the substance useful in the treatment of water, necessitate safety precautions for prevention of unnecessary exposure.  Such precautions reduce the threat of injury to plant employees and surrounding populations.  Training of new employees should include the hazards of handling and using chlorine as outlined in Section 8, Prevention Program 2.  Emphasis of the training should be on prevention of accidents and injury associated with the storage and use of chlorine.  There have been no plant accidents in the preceding 5-year period.  The accidental release Prevention Program is in effect.  The RMP Manual is available for use at the plant.  Emergency Response Policies have been in effect and are not being revised as a part of the RMP."
