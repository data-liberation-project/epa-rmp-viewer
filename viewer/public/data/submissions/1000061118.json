      "SummaryText": "Introduction\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Kennedy/Jenks Consultants (KJ) prepared Risk Management Program (RMP) plans for the City of San Buenaventura's (City) Avenue Water Treatment Plant (AWTP), and Bailey Water Conditioning Facility (BWCF) in accordance with the USEPA Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Clean Air Act, Section 112-r-7, Risk Management Program), the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and the CalOSHA Process Safety Management Standard for chlorine disinfection systems located at these facilities. In 2003, KJ prepared a RMP Update for AWTP and BWCF following the addition of 19% aqueous ammonia at these facilities above CalARP threshold quantities. Although 19% aqueous ammonia is not regulated by Federal RMP Program or the CalOSHA PSM Standard, the 5-year update for the chlorine systems located at the AWTP and BWCF was conducted concurrently. The 2003 RMP update also included chlorine and ammonia systems located at the Saticoy Water Conditioning Facility (SWCF). In 2007 and 2008, KJ revised the RMP during the construction of a new chlorine facility at the AWTP and the conversion of the gaseous chlorine system at SCWF to sodium hypochlorite. The revised RMP was submitted to EPA and the City of Ventura Fire Department in February 2008. In 2010, Ventura Water made additional changes to the RMP and submitted the revised RMP to EPA electronically. An Updated RMP was prepared and submitted to EPA and the City of Ventura Fired Department in 2013. \r\n\r\nThe AWTP and BWCF are subject to the RMP, CalARP, and PSM requirements due the quantities of gaseous chlorine and aqueous ammonia used and stored at these facilities. The SWCF is subject to CalARP requirements due to the quantities of aqueous ammonia stored at the facility. This current 5-year RMP update is required by the Federal RMP, CalARP and CalOSHA PSM programs. \r\n\r\nFederal RMP, CalARP and PSM Applicability\r\n\r\nIn California, the state-equivalent of the Federal RMP is the CalARP program, which replaced"

      "SummaryText": "the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP). The CalARP program requires facilities that handle regulated substances on the Federal extremely hazardous substances list (or the State list of regulated substances), in quantities greater than Federal or State threshold quantities, to submit a RMP plan. The Federal RMP, CalARP and PSM threshold quantities for chlorine are 2,500, 1,500 and 100 pounds respectively. Chlorine is subject to CalARP requirements until it is injected into water (reducing the concentration to below 1 percent). Although not regulated by Federal RMP and CalOSHA PSM regulations, 19% wt. aqueous ammonia is regulated under the CalARP program. The threshold quantity for aqueous ammonia as a gas or in solution is 500 pounds. \r\n\r\nThe City can store a maximum of 30,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine at the AWTP and 16,000 pounds at the BWCF. Sodium hypochlorite, which is stored and used at the SWCF, is not regulated by the Federal RMP, CalARP or PSM regulations. In addition, the City stores a maximum of approximately 26,316 pounds of 19% wt. aqueous ammonia at the AWTP and 15,480 pounds at the BWCF and SWCF. Chlorine storage and feed systems at the City's AWTP and BWCF qualify for a Program 3 Prevention Program. However, the aqueous ammonia storage and feed systems at AWTP, BWCF and SWCF qualify for a Program 2 Prevention Program. Although the Program 2 Prevention Program requirements are less rigorous, the ammonia systems are included in the City's Program 3 Prevention Program developed for the chlorine systems. \r\n\r\nAccidental Releases during Past 5 Years\r\n\r\nThe City's water treatment facilities have not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property and environmental damage.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nIn compliance with Federal RMP, CalARP and PSM requirements, the City has developed an accidental release prevention program to minimize the potential for an on-s"

The accidental release prevention program includes the following elements:\r\n\u00bf\tReview of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine and aqueous ammonia systems to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\r\n\u00bf\tUpdating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures. All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\r\n\u00bf\tInitial safety training and three-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same level of safety training that the City provides for its own employees.\r\n\u00bf\tRegular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, with stringent documentation of all inspections.\r\n\u00bf\tPrompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\r\n\u00bf\tRigorous safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\r\n\u00bf\tRigorous investigation of any incidents that have the potential to cause or caused chlorine releases.\r\n\u00bf\tDevelopment of site-specific Emergency Action Plans.\r\n\u00bf\tImplementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM program, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\r\n\u00bf\tIndependent audits of the RMP program every three years.\r\nEmergency Response Procedures\r\n\tCity staff utilizes its Emergency Action Plans to provide step-by-step procedures for emergency response in the unlikely event of an accidental release.

With assistance from City staff, the Fire Department would conduct emergency response activities. City staff is trained in first aid procedures. \r\n\r\nHypothetical Accidental Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan must assess the downwind impacts of hypothetical accidental releases. EPA requires facilities to model the distance that a plume of released gas would travel before it dispersed to an ambient concentration equal to the \"Toxic Endpoint Concentration.\" The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for various compounds were specified by EPA, and are generally concentrations that would cause no physical harm but could interfere with people's ability to leave the area. The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for the RMP chemicals at the facility are 0.0087 parts per million (ppm) of chlorine in air and 0.14 ppm of aqueous ammonia in air. In accordance with EPA's rule, hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed for both chlorine and aqueous ammonia. Worst-case release and alternate release scenarios are presented. \r\n\r\nRMP*eSubmit\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 2009, EPA provided software called RMP*eSubmit for facilities to use for online RMP reporting. EPA asked that all facilities use this method to submit RMPs to improve data quality and to enable regulated facilities to readily access their RMPs."
