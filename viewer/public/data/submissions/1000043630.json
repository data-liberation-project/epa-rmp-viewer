The alarm system sensor is set to detect 3 ppm chlorine. The site also has visual and audible alarms that engage with the chlorine sensors.\n\n\n\nThe containers, piping, valves and dispensers are of the highest manufacturing quality. Quality control is performed on site quarterly and encompasses all equipment used in the chlorinating process to ensure proper prevention of a release and efficient response should a release occur.\n\n\n\nWritten policy thoroughly discusses all maintenance and minor leak response procedures. Training of all personnel is periodic and on going.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Identification\n\n\n\nThe facility is a publicly owned and operated water treatment facility that uses chlorine gas for disinfecting approximately 11.0 mgd potable water.\n\n\n\nChlorine gas is stored in a concrete block building located on the north east corner of a 11 acre fenced compound. Entrance to the compound is restricted and the chlorine building is kept locked at all times. A maximum of  6 - 1 ton full cylinders are stored within the chlorine building. Only 1 ton cylinder is in use at any one time. \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe City of Bend Safety Policy requires that all employees expected to work with chlorine gas as part of their job duties follow OSHA/PSM rules. In addition, initial training and continuous refresher training is mandatory at a minimum of every 3 years and after any revisions to a process.\n\n\n\nAlarm systems are checked for operational integrity continuously.\n\n\n\nAll release incidents regardless of severity are reviewed by a team composed of management and staff who are actively involved with the operation of the equipment. \n\n\n\nMe"

      "SummaryText": "chanical integrity of all equipment and piping used in the chlorine distribution system is checked annually.\n\n\n\nA compliance audit is performed every 3 years. The audits shall insure that all the accidental release prevention measures are being conducted in a timely manner, that action is taken in response to all suggestions to improve release prevention, and that documentation is recorded.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have not been any accidents resulting in off site releases of chlorine gas in the past 5 years. There have not been any since and including the start up of the facility in 1991. Any release due to valves leaking or other minor leaks have been attended to in a safe and timely manner. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAny catastrophic releases of chlorine gas will result in a response by the Bend Fire Dept. who will take command of the scene. \n\n\n\nOperation staff is expected to train and respond to minor releases that occur with process equipment.\n\nA chlorine alarm occurring while non-routine activity is being conducted shall be evaluated by trained operation employees following the safety procedure adopted by the City. The degree of the release will be determined by the trained employees witnessing the release. If it is determined that a release is beyond their ability to repair given the safety policy guidelines, the City of Bend Fire Dept shall be called to take command.\n\n\n\nPublic notification of a catastrophic release shall be through the County Sheriff's Dept. who uses the Emergency Broadcast System and door to door evacuation.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAny and all suggestions made by operation staff will be considered and action taken will be documented including decisions to make no change."
