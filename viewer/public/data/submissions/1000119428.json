      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nATI EPA Facility Identifier: 1000 0010 2925\n\n1.0 FACILITY DESCRIPTION and SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nATI operates a metals manufacturing process utilizing both chlorine and aqua ammonia to manufacture chlorides and oxides in the metals forming process. The chlorine inventory exceeds the 2,500 lb. threshold, and aqua ammonia total inventory of the system exceeds the 20,000-pound threshold quantity triggering both PSM/RMP requirements. The system(s) were originally constructed in 1957 with varying expansions or modifications conducted to date. Access to the facility is limited to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.  Due to being a government supplier, our security systems adhere to stringent requirements.\n\n2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nSafety at ATI is inherent in the way chlorine and aqua ammonia are handled. While the design of the facility incorporates multiple safety devices, safe handling procedures, maintaining mechanical integrity, and appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to safety at our facility.\nATI has implemented a process safety management (PSM) program that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119, which requires ATI to implement integrated safeguards to prevent releases. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action and Emergency Response Plans, developed in compliance with the emergency planning provisions of OAR 437-002-0042 and OAR 1910.120(q). The emergency plans include pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties to enable coordinated action to effectively deal with unplanned events. These events include tabletop exercises with the local LEPC and monthly team trainings.\n\n3.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM and CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nATI\u0092s written PSM program documents incorporate many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the chlorine and ammonia equipment.

      "SummaryText": "elements essential to safe operation of the chloride and oxide processes include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually, audited every three years, and updated as necessary by ATI.\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating the chlorine and ammonia systems understand the manufacturing processes, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. Only qualified maintenance and operating personnel operate the chlorine and ammonia systems.\n\n4.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \nThere have been no reportable accidents at the ATI facility in the past five years.\n\n5.0\tEMERGENCY PLANNING and RESPONSE\nATI has a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and Emergency Response Plan (ERP) to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. The emergency action plan complies with the provisions of OAR 437-002-0042 and the emergency response plan complies with OAR 1910.120(q). The emergency plans include pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties, enabling those who deal with emergencies to have a strategy to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been provided to and reviewed with the local fire department and are reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\nThe ammonia and chlorine processes have backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming potential release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, automatic alarms, shutdown systems, and controls have been designed to minimize the potential for an uncontrolled release. ATI has trained HAZMAT personnel, including Incident Commanders (SERO) and Responders available to immediatel"

      "SummaryText": "y take defensive actions to mitigate any release.  This includes immediate notification of the local fire department for assistance.  \nAll ATI personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Internal mock & tabletop emergency drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\nComplying with RMP, Subpart E requirements, ATI coordinates with local emergency planning and response organizations (LEPC) to perform emergency response exercises, making them aware of the ammonia and chlorine systems, associated risks, and the current emergency plan. ATI will provide the following information during the annual coordination:\n\u0095\tThe current emergency plan(s)\n\u0095\tCurrent emergency contact information\n\u0095\tOther information necessary for developing and implementing the local emergency response plan.\n\u0095\tKnown offsite impacts\nATI will document coordination with local authorities, including the names of individuals involved and their contact information, the date of coordination activities, and the nature of coordination activities.\n\n6.0\tPLANNED CHANGES to IMPROVE SAFETY  \nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed will follow codes and standards applicable at that time.\nATI\u0092s current focus is on improved measurement and collection of process conditions and data, improving employee access to improve job performance, in turn improving system performance.  In addition, in 2025 ATI is performing an updated engineering assessment, including design and function, of our chlorine station.  Results will be included in our 5-year Process Hazard Analyses (PHA).\nATI will also be working to comply with the new Safer Communities by Chemical Accident Prevention, Risk Management final rule as adopted in 2024."
