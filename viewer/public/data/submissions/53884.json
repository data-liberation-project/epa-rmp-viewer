This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant located in Eddy County, New Mexico, is  owned by Enterprise Field Services L.L.C. and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC..\n\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant is a cryogenic turboexpander gas processing facility that utilizes cooling and pressure reduction to reduce the temperature of an inlet, field gas stream to a very low temperature, causing liquifiable hydrocarbons to condense from the gas stream.   The mixed hydrocarbon liquid stream (Y-Grade product) is treated to remove carbon dioxide and is pumped as a mixed product via pipeline to fractionation facilities elsewhere.  The plant discharge gas stream (residue gas) flows from the plant via a residue gas pipeline to market..  \n\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities to be kept on site based on the process design and the size of the proposed process vessels.  Listed flammable substances which will be present above the threshold quantities at the Chaparral Gas Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and pentane.  The Plant is designed t"

There are no other gas processing, gas compression or industrial facilities nearby.  The Chaparral Gas Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  Due to the presence of regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity, the Chaparral Gas Plant is being registered as an EPA Risk Management Program 1 facility..  \n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site, but no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  The calculated distance for the Worst Case Scenario is less than the distance to the nearest offsite receptor.  Since there have been no accidents with offsite consequences within the last five years and emergency response is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Commission, the plant qualifies as an RMP Program 1 facility.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the safety and accident prevention program in place at the Chaparral Gas Plant.  The location safety management program is in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, CFR 1910.119.)  The processes at the plant are also regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  However, the remote location of the Chaparral Gas Plant allows the facility to be registered as an RMP Program 1 faciltiy, which does not need to have an accident prevention program to protect the public.

Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding safety compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a \u00bfnear-miss\u00bf reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nNecessary process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS) which are available online through the Enterprise ImageWave MSD"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nEnterprise Products Operating, LLC has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with gas processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings for existing facilities is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios are assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and are updated when necessary if the operators discover procedural errors, or if changes in operating conditions require a change in the operating procedures.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n \n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Chaparral Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas compression and process plant operations.  In addition, all operators receive work practice training related to the safe accomplishment of operating and maintenance tasks.
