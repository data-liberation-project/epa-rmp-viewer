EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n     Tomah Reserve, inc. is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the  Reserve Plant \r\nworkers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the  Reserve Plant has established a \r\nsystem to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk \r\nmanagement program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the  Reserve Plant and that complies with the \r\nrequirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental \r\nRelease Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of \r\nthe RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the  \r\nReserve Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to \r\nprovide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Reserve Plant.\r\n\r\n1.2\t Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\n     Tomah Reserve is committed to the safety of  the  Reserve Plant workers and the public, and to the \r\npreservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  \r\nThe  Reserve Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. \r\nIn the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to minimize such releases. \r\nThe  Reserve Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and coordinates with the local \r\nemergency planning committee (LEPC), which have established a program to warn the community if an \r\naccident occurs that could threaten the community.\r\n\r\n1.2\t The Reserve Plant and Regulated Substances\r\nThe   Reserve Plant handles  two (2) substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be \r\ncovered by the RMP rule:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEthylene and"

Implementation of mitigation \r\noptions in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

All approved \r\nmitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  \r\nThe final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n     \r\n     To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate \r\nsignificantly from the original design safety features, the Reserve Plant periodically updates and revalidates \r\nthe hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be \r\nconducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these \r\nupdates are documented and retained.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a \r\nlockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a \r\nprocedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a \r\npermit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure \r\nto ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and \r\nothers), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and \r\nmaintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n     Continued on the next page\r\n\r\n     \r\n     Management of Change\r\n     \r\n     The Reserve Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system \r\nrequires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process \r\noperating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before \r\nbeing implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any \r\nnew hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided \r\nwith any necessary training on the change.\r\n     \r\n     Incident Investigation\r\n     \r\n     The Reserve Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have \r\nresulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal \r\ninjury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a \r\nrecurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops \r\nrecommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Reserve Plant management for \r\nresolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u00bfs findings and recommendations \r\nare tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, \r\nand the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected \r\nby the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be \r\nreviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \r\n     \r\n     Compliance Audits\r\n     \r\n     To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Reserve Plant \r\nperiodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident  \r\nprevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both \r\nhourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings \r\nthat are forwarded to the  Reserve Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to \r\nthe audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is \r\ndocumented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \r\n\r\n     Chemical-specific Preventio"
