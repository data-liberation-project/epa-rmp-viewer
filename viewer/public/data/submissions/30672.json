The DSM Facility has three covered processes:  Phosphorus Oxychloride, Chloroform and 37% Hydrochloric Acid.  In all three processes, storage containers do not exceed 55-gallon drums.  The chemical manufacturing portion of the DSM Facility are currrently being decommissioned.  It in expected that all chemical production will cease by 1/1/05 and the facility will not have any covered processes.
