The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\n\nThe Linde  facility located in Canton, Michigan complies with NFPA requirements for Acetylene manufacturing and storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our  acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Canton Fire Department and the Linde Gas emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency.  In addition, each employee is trained monthly on safety policies and procedures.  Hazards identified during quarterly \"safety walks\" are corrected as soon as possible.  \n\n\n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Linde  facility manufactures and stores acetylene.  Gases are put into storage cylinders of various s before they are sold and shipped from the facility.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a low pressure acetylene generator and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  The low pressure acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and stored in a \"gas holder\".  The acetylene that is generated in the low pressure generator is piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  \n\n\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Linde facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The acetylene system are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA and state law at the Linde facility in Canton, Michigan.  Each  filler is trained by a certified trainer in all operation fill procedures.  All employees are trained annually on the possible dangers and preventitive safety measures to be taken in the event o"

The emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our acetylene processe, it is Lindes' policy to immediately notify the Canton Fire Department and the Linde emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency.  We have communicated this policy with the Canton Fire Department.  All members of the Linde emergency response team carry a Technician level certification and yearly training is required by OSHA 1910.120.  All employees have access to Lindes' emergency action plan.  Emergency response training is conducted annually.  Both the Canton Fire Department and the Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Commission receive copies of our SARA 312 and SARA 313 reports.  In addition, a fire alarm system has been installed to detect fires in the acetylene plant.  Fire drills are conducted at least once per year.  \n\n\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nA bi-yearly \"Fire Day\" is planned for both employees and local customers which will enhance our relationship with the community.  The first of these \"Fire Days\" was completed in June 2013 with both the Canton Fire Department and the Wayne County Emergency Planning Commission."
