We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of systems used at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Shell Elastomers Belpre Plant produces Kraton(R) and Shellvis(R) thermoplastic elastomers using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Our facility includes four polymer production units, a compounding unit and utilities and other support services.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nChemical                         Use        \n\nAmmonia                                    processing aid        \n\n\nFlammables\n\nChemical                        Use        \n\n1,3-Butadiene                                              raw material             \nEthyl ether[Ethane,1,1'-oxybis-]                         processing aid                 \nHydrogen                                 raw material                         "

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n(It is important to note that the chances of this scenario actually happening are extremely remote.  No such event has occurred in the history of the plant.)\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia vessel failure resulting in a 20,000 lb release of ammonia.  This scenario assumes ALL ammonia forms a gas cloud within ten minutes and that no control or response measures are activated or used. This scenario would have significant offsite consequences.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\nEven though no realistic scenario would impact property beyond Shell's, the EPA strongly prefers that the alternative release scenario presented reach beyond the Shell property line.  \n\nThe alternate-case toxic release scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia transfer hose failure resulting in a 1000 lb release of ammonia with offsite consequences.  A trained Incident Commander provides leadership in any emergency release.  The Incident Command Organization includes many trained emergency responders and is supported by skilled personnel who know the equipment and chemicals.\n\nMitigations already in place to prevent releases include vessel design for higher pressure, manned truck unloading, two independent level g"

No reportable emergency releases of ammonia have occurred at the plant in more than 7 years.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n(It is important to note that the chances of this scenario actually happening are extremely remote.  No such event has occurred in the history of the plant.)\n\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario involves a 1,3-Butadiene vessel failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of 4,950,000 lbs of 1,3-Butadiene.  This scenario assumes a full storage tank release and explosion.  Significant offsite consequences would occur with this scenario. \n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nEven though no realistic scenario would impact property beyond Shell's, the EPA prefers that the alternative release scenario presented reach beyond the Shell property line.\n\nThe alternate-case flammable release scenario involves a 1,3-Butadiene relief valve leak resulting in a 30,000 lb release and vapor cloud explosion of 1,3-Butadiene.

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup safety reviews\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\nA prevention effort specific to this facility is a triple redundancy polymer safety system (\"Poly Safety System\").  The Poly Safety System is designed to prevent runaway polymerization reactions by ensuring more energy is never placed into a reactor than can be safely contained.\n\nIn general, the Shell Elastomers Belpre Plant is dedicated to continuous safety improvement and all chemicals are treated with equal respect when it comes to release prevention.  Our ongoing training, procedure review, auditing and process improvements are utilized in reaching our goal of an accident and injury-free workplace.\n\nThe individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases."
