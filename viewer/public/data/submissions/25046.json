Applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed . The facility emergency policy involves the preparation of plans tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nThe spill prevention policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated flammable substances. In the event such a release occurs personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Greasewood Quick Cycle Gas Plant, a remote unattended faciity, located in rural Rio Blanco County, Colorado, recovers petroleum products ( e.g. natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) from field gas. The NGL separated from the field gas is stored on site and is sold to others for further processing. NGL is a flammable mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including regulated flammables methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, isopentane and pentane. There are no threshold toxic substances present. \n\nWORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worse case scenario (WCS) at this Program 2 stationary source is the release of the maximum content of the storage tank, which forms a flammable vapor cloud and the cloud detonates. For flammable substances the end point is an overpressure of 1 psi. The endpoint distance, determined by EPA's RMP Comp., indicates that this facility has public receptors. No credit for mitigating measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternate release scenario (ARS) is failure of a 2 inch steel pipe connecting to the NGL srorage tank with the release resulting"

The end point for this scenario was calculated at 0.1 mile. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe necessary steps have been taken to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR part 68. This stationary source was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations and applicable good engineering practices. The following briefly describes the release prevention program. \n\nSafety Information \n\nA variety of documents are available and used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents cover chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and specific chemical inventories, equipment specification and design basis/ configuration information. This information is updated when a change occurs that makes the information inaccurate. \n\nChemical specific information describing the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances is maintained e.g. material safety data sheets. For specific process areas, safety related limits for specific process parameters  (e.g. temperature, pressure, level) are documented. Process controls and monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems and trained personnel are used to maintain the process within these limits.\n\nInformation about the design and construction of the process equipment is maintained and readily available. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as evaluating proposed changes to make sure that process safety features are not compromised.\n\nHazard Review\n\nHazard reviews are conducted to identify and control hazards associated with the process and regulated substances including the potential for equipment or human error; and the safeguards needed to detect, control or prevent hazards, equipment malfunction and human error.  Applicable standards, rules and good engineering practices are ulilized in the review process. The mo"

Hazard analysis findings are addressed in a timely manner. Findings and final resolutions are documented and maintained. Additional reviews/ inspections include pre startup for new/ modified process or equipment and periodic equipment inspections.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures for safely conducting activities associated with regulated substances have been prepared and are maintained at the facility.   These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown. The operating procedures can be used as a reference by experienced employees and serve as a basis for consistent training of new personnel. The procedures are readily accessable to employees; and are reviewed as needed and updated if necessary.\n\nTraining\n\nA training program is in place to train employees involved in process operations. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are determined to be competent to work independently.  Training on new and updated procedures is provided before startup after a major change. Refresher training is provided at least ever 3 years or more frequently if needed or requested.  In addition, employees not operating the process receive safety training on the hazards associated with the process and regulated substances at the facility. \n\nMaintenance\n\nMaintenance checks/ inspections are performed on the facility equipment to ensure proper function.

These audits are conducted at least ever 3 years in accord with 40 CFR 68. Procedures are in place to make sure corrective actions required as a result of an audit are resolved in a timely manner. The 2 most recent audit reports will be retained on file.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAn incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance will be investigated promptly as possible, and will be initiated within 48 hours after the incident. The goal of the investigation is to determine the facts and develope corrective actions to prevent a recurrance, or a similar incident. A summary report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation. The findings and resolutions will be documented. The findings will be reviewed with the affected personnel.  Summaries will be retained for 5 years.\n\nEmergency Plan\n\nFor this unmanned facility, an emergency action plan has been developed and imlpemented.
