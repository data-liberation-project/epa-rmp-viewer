      "SummaryText": "Land O' Sun Dairies, LLC is proud to inform all interested parties that our company is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68. In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nLand O' Sun Dairies, LLC is located at 400 S. Chambers Drive, Decatur Indiana 46733. The facility produces ice cream and related ice cream novelties. Plant 1 and Plant 2 operate independent anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety performance; and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require. Major equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers, accumulators, purgers, and heat exchangers.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nFacility 1 and Facility 2 refrigeration systems required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. Facilty1 refrigeration system contains approximately 27,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Facility 2 refrigeration system contains approximately 36,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nThe site is approximately 12.5 acres, cont"

Major areas include cold storage areas, warehouses, shipping areas, production areas, machinery rooms, and office spaces. Plant 2 is approximately 62,800 square feet. Major areas include cold storage areas, warehouses, shipping areas, production areas, machinery rooms, and office spaces. The Fab Shop is approximately 8,500 square feet and is used primarily as a storage area.\n\nLand O' Sun Dairies, LLC has implemented Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs that has numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and, accepted by all employees at our facility. Our facility management believes in the importance of work place safety and are empowered to enforce all of our company policies.\n\nLand O' Sun Dairies, LLC has organized the Process Safety Management Program information and polices pertaining to the process into a complete library consisting of nine volumes. \n\nVolume I of the PSM/RMP Library incorporates mainly policies, the following policies are included in Volume I: Volume I covers Plant 1 and Plant 2.\n\nEmployee Participation Guidelines: This policy outlines the commitment between management and employees to establish a program for a successful (safe) program.\n\nProcess Safety Information: This includes information on the ammonia inventory at the facility, applicable codes, design standa"
