The cornerstone of this assurance is prevention.\n\nPrevention is accomplished through properly maintained equipment, trained and competent employees, sound policies, well thought out programs, and ongoing programs for risk reduction.  All of these building blocks of accident prevention are cemented together by the firm commitment to safety by senior corporate management and all subsequent levels of supervision.\n\nEqually important is our business emergency response readiness and capability.  Devon Gas Services, L.P. will be prepared to respond in the most efficient, effective manner to mitigate crisis incidents as rapidly as possible, while minimizing the impact on people, property, the environment, and our reputation.  Our goal is to assure the facility has adequately planned and prepared for emergencies.\n\nDevon Gas Services endorses the following four principles as they relate to crisis management and emergency preparedness:\n\n1.  Vigilance:  All employees are responsible for assuring that their actions are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and corporate policies.  All are encouraged to promptly report events or situations that may create unsafe conditions.  No disciplinary action or retribution will be imposed on any employee for vigilance; but failure to act on this responsibility may have severe consequences.\n2.  Responsiveness:  Devon Gas Services endorses the principle of effective over-response and will bring the full resources of the corporation to bear in supporting local emergency response efforts.  In addition, Devon is commited to maintaining open communication with those affected by an emergency both inside and outside the corporation.\n3.  Unity:  A major crisis aff"

Only by communicating and pulling together across normal organizational lines can Devon withstand a major crisis.  Employees at all levels are expected to perform beyond their regular duties.  However, under no circumstances are personnel expected to perform any task that places them at undue risk.\n4.  Accountability:  Devon Gas Services staff is accountable to the public and to each other.  Our constituents include employees, customers, shareholders, industry regulators, and the public at large.  Therefore, our decisions in an emergency situation should be guided accordingly.\n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Beaver Creek Gas Plant is a remote natural gas processing facility that has been in operation for approximately 40 years.\n\nThe purpose of this remote natural gas processing facility is to take raw field natural gas and process it into pipeline quality natural gas (like that used to heat homes.)  In addition, during the processing of the raw field natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL's) are removed, separated and stored.\n\nThe pipeline quality natural gas, composed primarily of methane and ethane, is not stored at this facility but is sold into a natural gas pipeline.  This pipeline quality natural gas is then distributed to companies who sell it as fuel for heating homes and industrial purposes. Natural gas volume estimates do not reach threshold quantities.\n\nThe natural gas liquids are typically stored in pressurized storage tanks until it is sold and transported away from the facility by truck transports.   The NGSs produced at the Beaver Creek Gas Plant are generally known as propane, butane, and natural gasoline.  The NGL products are sold and transported from this facility for use as industrial feedstock, LP-gas type fuel, and motor fuel components.  It is the NGL product that is estimated to reach threshold quantities.\n\nThe NGL products mentioned above are conside"

Since the separation process is not exact, these products are typically mixtures of various hydrocarbon components (i.e., propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane, etc.)  The significant quantities of these products are located in the pressurized storage tanks described above.  These tanks are co-located inside a large bermed area, a safe distance from the processing plant.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the process contained in this risk management plan was calculated using the RMP comp software, version 1.06.  It modeled the worst case release of a flammable mixture composed primarily of propane.\n\nThe worst case release modeled the catastrophic failure of one of the pressurized propane storage tanks containing a maximum of 1,071 barrels of propane.  (The 1,071 barrels is an over estimate of what actually would be released from one tank since it is standard operating procedure to not fill the pressurized tanks beyond 89% of capacity.)  In addition, it assumed approximately 100 barrels of product would also be released from associated piping and processes.  No benefit was taken for the potentially reduced surface area caused by the bermed storage area.\n\nThe worst case estimated distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint of the vapor cloud explosion was 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers.)  There are no apparent offsite impacts associated with this work case release due to the remote and rural location of the facility.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management program.  Therefore, it utilizes such prevention tools as process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity testing, maintenance programs, personnel training, management of change, and others.  All of these tools aid in preventing an accidental release.\n\nOther practices in use at this facility to reduce the potential for an accidental release and minimize potential impacts if "

Standard operating procedures, such as not filling the pressurized storage tanks beyond a safe level (i.e., 89% of capacity for propane), to allow for potential thermal expansion of the NGL in the tank.\n2.  Proper inspection and testing procedures, such as the inspection and testing of the pressure safety valves used to prevent any potential overpressure and possible rupture of the storage tanks.\n3.  Mitigation measures, such as surrounding the storage tanks in a bermed area that restricts the spreading of a liquid release and establishes a barrier to reduce the potential for a vehicle impacting a storage tank.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nDuring the operation of this facility by Devon Gas Services, L.P. (formerly Santa Fe Snyder Corporation) there have been no accidental releases of a regulated substance that have lead to any on or offsite deaths, injuries, or environmental impacts.  In addition, records and reports from personnel familiar with the operation of this facility confirm that no accidents occurred involving a regulated substance in the approximately four years prior to Devon Gas Services, L.P. becoming responsible for the facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n1. Establishes an On-site Emergency Response Team, comprised of key personnel familiar with this facility.  Their primary responsibility is to assume immediate command during emergency situations and be responsible for the protection and welfare of personnel and community, controlling property damage, securing the facility, and coordination of public relations efforts.  If necessary they will also activate the Regional Emergency Response Management Team.\n2.
