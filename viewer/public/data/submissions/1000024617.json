(FloMin) has reviewed and enhanced accidental release procedures and emergency response policies. These policies have been incorporated in the facility's Emergency Response Plan, Plant Safety Manual, Operating Manual, and Utilities Manual.\n\n\n\nCarbon disulfide, a toxic substance, is the only chemical at the FloMin facility that is stored above the threshold quantity and regulated by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR 68.  It is used in the production of chemicals used primarily as reagents in the mining industry.  The specific product groups that use carbon disulfide are Xanthates , TCs, and Metalsorbs.  All of these products are produced in one reactor (reactor R2) and are evaluated as one process (CS2 Processes) for hazard analysis.  The maximum quantity of carbon disuldife stored on-site is approximately 189,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with chemical-specific prevention steps has been developed. \n\n\n\nThe CS2 Processes prevention program includes the following process controls and mitigation systems:\n\n\n\n*Vents\n\n*Relief valves\n\n*Check valves\n\n*Manual shutoffs\n\n*Automatic shutoffs\n\n*Interlocks\n\n*Alarms and procedures\n\n*Grounding equipment\n\n*Dikes\n\n*Detectors\n\n*Deluge system\n\n*Scrubbers\n\n*Rupture disks\n\n*Purge system\n\n\n\nAlso included in the prevention program for carbon disulfide are the following programs, practices and procedures (as part of the facility's Emergency Response Plan, Plant Safety Manual, Operating Manual, and Utilities Manual):\n\n\n\n*Emergency Response\n\n*Emergency Action\n\n*Process Safety Management\n\n*Hurricane and Tropical Storm\n\n*First Responder Team\n\n*Hazard Communication\n\n*Hazardous Waste Management\n\n*Stormwater Pollution Prevention\n\n*Safe Work Practices\n\n*Hazmat/Hazw"

The ERP has been coordinated with the Chambers County LEPC and the Beach City Volunteer Fire Department. In addition, ERP resources are obtained through the Chambers County Sheriff's Department, San Jacinto Methodist Hospital, Baycoast Medical Center, and Mutual Aid Mount Belvieu (MAMB) Organization.  As part of the community involvement efforts, the following activities are coordinated with some of the agencies listed above:\n\n\n\n*Pre-emergency tours\n\n*Emergency action drills\n\n*Community evacuation procedures\n\n*Material safety data sheets\n\n*Responsibility roles in evacuation procedures\n\n\n\nAlso, the facility has a plant emergency notification system.\n\n\n\nAs part of preparing the RMP, the facility's five year accident history was reviewed.  During the past five years, there have been no RMP reportable accidental releases.\n\n\n\nFloMin is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Planned changes and policies to promote this improvement include continuous review and update of the facility's ERP and various environmental, health, and safety policies, procedures, and practices. These include all the programs and plans listed above in the prevention programs as well as safety incentive programs to promote employee safety and community awareness programs.\n\n"
