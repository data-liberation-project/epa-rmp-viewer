We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant consists of one (1) 300 MMSCFD cryogenic plant, one (1) 5000 BPD (Std. ideal liquid) Stabilizer system and all associated utilities in Loving County, Texas. \n\nThe Plant is designed to process a maximum flow capacity of 300 MMSCFD of the design inlet gas composition at design inlet conditions.  The facility comprises of a slug catcher to remove pigged and condensed liquids from the inlet gas, inlet gas treating utilizing DOW's proprietary MDEA&reg; solvent to remove carbon dioxide and TEG and Molecular Sieve dehydration units to remove water.  The cryogenic plant utilizes a Gas Sub-Cooled"

Ethane rejection is achieved with minimal process changes and allow for ethane recoveries of approximately 20% while maintaining calculated propane recovery at 94%.    The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\n\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nNo toxic materials to report. \n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nPropane is used as a refrigerant at the facility.  Y-Grade mixed NGL product is produced at the facility and shipped via pipeline.\n\n\n\nOther flammable substances present are; incoming natural gas which is except from RMP regulations as a naturally occurring hydrocarbon, residue natural gas which is not present in threshold quantities, and the stabilized condensate which is classified as an NPFA 3 flammable and not subject to RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Mentone Gas Plant. The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM Standard.  \n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Mentone Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark- producing activities (hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant has safety features to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n\n* Fire detectors\n\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n\n* Seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\n\n* Vapor recovery system to limit releases from truck loading operations\n\n* Terminal fire detection system\n\n* Terminal emergency shutdown (ESD) system with multiple activation points\n\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\n\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, "

      "SummaryText": "hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\n\n\nThe facility has not had an accidental release which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\n\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Mentone Gas Plant is coordinated with the Lee County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Mentone Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Mentone Gas Plant. \n\n\n\n*The Mentone Gas Plant is new construction.  No changes are planned."
