The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Mentone Gas Plant is coordinated with the Lee County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Mentone Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Mentone Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Mentone Gas Plant. \r\n\r\n*The Mentone Gas Plant is new construction.  No changes are planned."

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark- producing activities (hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Mentone Gas Plant has safety features to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\r\n* Fire detectors\r\n* Plant video surveillance system\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\r\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\r\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\r\n* Seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\r\n* Vapor recovery system to limit releases from truck loading operations\r\n* Terminal fire detection system\r\n* Terminal emergency shutdown (ESD) system with multiple activation points\r\n* Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\r\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing,"

Ethane rejection is achieved with minimal process changes and allow for ethane recoveries of approximately 20% while maintaining calculated propane recovery at 94%.    The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.
