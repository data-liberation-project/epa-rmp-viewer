Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen. Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.  This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the flammable gas mixture.  The primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen. Hydrogen is used by our refinery customer to manufacture \"clean fuels.\" Hydrocarbon based gases (which consists of hydrogen, methane, butane, and pentane) are received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock. The feed stock is compressed and \"cracked\" in our reformer (furnace). By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat(approximately 1,500 degrees F.) and steam, a che"

The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is then separated from the hydrogen in absorbers. The pure hydrogen is compressed and delivered to customer via an underground pipeline network.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER standard. At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies. They have been trained to OSHAs First Responder Awareness Level. The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan. Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Marathon Emergency Response Department for fires related to the flammable process.  Periodic drills are conducted with agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures.\n\n"
