Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nHuntsman Peru is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and environmentally conscious work-place for its\nemployees and neighbors. The Huntsman Peru facility maintains a working PSM program, which implements a\nseries of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.\nThe PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals. Huntsman Peru\ncoordinates emergency response activities with the La Salle County LEPC, City of Peru Fire\nDepartment, City of La Salle Fire Department and Coast Guard. Huntsman assists local officials in the development of\nemergency procedures to identify resources, chemicals, contacts, and material safety data sheets for\nparticipating companies. Other community activities include cooperative training between the Peru facility and\nthe Illinois Valley Community Hospital (IVCH). Since its certification in November 1993, the Peru Site has been\nan active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n2. Regulated Substances.\nThe Peru site manufactures polystyrene-based products consisting of two main process areas where\nexpandable polystyrene (EPS) and performance resins (PR) are produced and a tank farm where the regulated\nsubstance is stored.  Huntsman's Peru facility has 1regulated substance, pentane (flammable liquid), that is used by the facility. The pentane is brought to the facility via railcar and is off loaded into one of the three 30000 gallon storage tanks as appropriate.  The pentane is then pumped to the production areas where the pentane is diffused in the polystyrene beads.  The pentane is added to the polystyrene beads to cause the beads expand when heated.  Once the pentane is inside the beads the beads are dried, screened and packaged for shi"

General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Peru Site has implemented to comply with the\naccidental release prevention requirements outlined by the EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and\nSafety Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.\n- Process Safety Information\nHuntsman's Peru Site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and\nunderstand the hazards of the process. This includes information pertaining to:\n- Hazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet\n(MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal\nprotective equipment and the appropriate f irst aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n- The technology of the process: Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of\ntemperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n- Equipment in the process: Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and\ninstrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n- Process Hazard Analysis\nHuntsman's Peru Site has performed process hazard analysis on each process to identify the potential hazards,\nthe adequacy of the engineering and adminstrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards. The Peru\nSite typically utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and\nevaluating hazards in the process. The Peru Site assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are\nknowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process. The HAZOP team develops\nrecommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable\nperiod of time.

The procedures\naddress steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures, and precautions to prevent\nexposures to process hazards. The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy\nand completeness.\n- Training\nHuntsman Peru provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required\nlevel of skills and knowledge are maintained. The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency\noperations, and safe work practices. All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n- Mechanical Integrity\nHuntsman Peru has developed written procedures for maintaining the operative components of the process\n(including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown\nsystem controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program. The program is comprised of well trained\npersonnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n- Management of Change\nHuntsman Peru has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that af fect a covered process.\nThe procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the\nproposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary\ntime period for the change, and any authorization requirements.

The pre-startup safety review\nconf irms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in\naccordance with design specif ications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place;\nmanagement-of-change requirements are met; and training of employees af fected by modif ications is complete.\n- Compliance Audit\nHuntsman Peru performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its process safety management\nprogram. Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and\noperating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed\nare adequate and being followed. The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective\nactions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n- Incident Investigation\nHuntsman Peru investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, catastrophic\nrelease of covered chemicals. The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any\nincident. To perform the investigation, Huntsman Peru has established an incident invesigation team is convened consisting\nof persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.\nA report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that\ncontributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.

Huntsman Peru ensures that all employees have access to PHAs and all other process\nsafety management information.\n- Hot Work Permit\nHuntsman Peru employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near a coveredprocess (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing\noperations). If any hot work is performed near a covered process, Huntsman Peru issues a permit that\ndocuments the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work,\nand the object on which the work is performed. Hot work permits are kept on f ile until the work is complete.\n- Contractors\nHuntsman Peru has developed procedures for selecting and ensuring that contractors are competent and\nknowledgeable and can safely perform their work.
