This facility complies with all State and Federal requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and handling.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Hamburg Fire Department and the Fremont County LEPC.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUSTANCES HANDLED.\nThis facility is an agricultural fertilizer and chemical retail outlet.  We handle anhydrous ammonia, dry and liquid fertilizer, and chemicals for corn and soybean crops.  For ammonia storage we have two (2) - 30,000 gallon tanks used for agricultural fertilizer.\n\nTHE WORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.\nOur worse case scenario would be a failure with our storage tank, as a gas release.  According to EPA 'look-up' tables, the endpoint distance would be 5.6 miles, and include approximately 1670 people.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  \n\nFIVE - YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\nWe have never had an accident involving ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage or evacuations.\n\nTHGE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\nIf an emergency arises with our anhydrous ammonia plant, it is our policy to call the Hamburg Fire Department and the Fremont County LEPC to respond.  Several of our customers are on the Fire and Rescue squad, and familiar with our facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\nNone scheduled at this time."
