      "SummaryText": "The City of Broken Arrow Risk Management Plan for the Lynn Lane Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and mangement practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protectin Agency (EPA) Prevention Program/Risk Managment Program are adhered to.  The City of Broken Arrow Emergency Operations Plan addresses mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery procedures for toxic chemical and hazardous material releases.  The plan takes into account community wide coordination with other responding agencies.\n\nThe purpose of the Lynn Lane Waste Water Treatment Plant is to treat/disinfect all waste water flowing out of the Broken Arrow Creek Basin area.  The WWTP is located on South Lynn Lane, next to the Arkansas River.  The facility includes a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, two chlorine leak detectors, and various safety equipment.  Additionally, the facility is equipped with a monitoring/alarm system in the event of a release and a Vacume Scrubber system is also in place so that any leak can be nuetralized before escaping into the environment.  The WWTP also has an instrument room, which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine handled is two one-ton containers.  The facility is normally manned during regular business hours and an on-call system is in place.  Water treatment operators work in the facility daily and respond to any trouble area which may occur.\n"
