The Facility Policy:\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Equity Exchange - Turpin East, Turpin, OK are committed to the\n\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the\n\nfacility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and\n\nminimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n\n\n? The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n? Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop\n\nproduction nutrients.\n\n? The maximum quantity stored would be 130,000 pounds in our one 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \n\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which\n\nrepresents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The\n\ndistance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 6.9 miles.\n\n\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential\n\nincident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200\n\nppm) is 1.30 miles.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\n\nAmmonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the\n\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and ha"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n? Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n? To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property\n\ndamage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as\n\nrequired under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\nc. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n\nplanning and employee training.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the\n\nmaintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety\n\nrecommendations for implementation at this time."
