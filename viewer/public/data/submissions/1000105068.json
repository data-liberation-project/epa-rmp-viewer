      "SummaryText": "The MAPEI polymer plant is located in West Chicago, Illinois. The MAPEI facility manufactures polymers for adhesives, sealants, and structural reinforcements for domestic flooring applications.  The polymers are manufactured from various monomers, including vinyl acetate, which is listed under 40 CFR 68.130 as a regulated toxic substance.\n\nVinyl acetate is stored in two 13,000-gallon storage tanks located in an outdoor tank farm at the MAPEI facility. One tank can be charged to 90% of its fill capacity (11,700 gallons) in accordance with internal administrative limits. At full capacity, up to 90,000 pounds of vinyl acetate can be stored in the tank. Vinyl acetate is listed in 40 CFR 68.130 as a regulated toxic substance with a threshold quantity of 15,000 pounds  The facility's use and storage of vinyl acetate is therefore a covered process and is subject to the risk management program requirements.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nMAPEI is committed to the safe operation of the subject processes at the West Chicago polymer plant. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources MAPEI has invested in accident prevention, including training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes that involve vinyl acetate monomer and aqua ammonia.  MAPEI's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent releases of these regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility personnel will respond to the release to ensure the release is contained and controlled.\n\nAs a Program 3 source, MAPEI has developed a written PSM Management System to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic events from process related incidents or releases at the West Chicago polymer plant. This includes releases of regulated substances such as vinyl acetate monomer or flammable substances.  The PSM system addresses the following program elements:\n\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation \n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\n\u00bf\tProces"

This is defined as 'all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage' (40 CFR Part 68.42). \n\nWithin the past five years, the MAPEI West Chicago site has had no accidental releases of vinyl acetate or aqua ammonia that resulted in the consequences listed in 40 CFR Part 68.42. \n\n\tEmergency Response Program \nMAPEI's emergency response plan emphasizes handling of accidental releases of regulated substances and coordination of emergency response with the local fire department and DuPage County emergency response providers. The response plan details the emergency response organizational structure and includes personnel responsibilities and procedures within that structure.  The procedures address proper first aid, medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, accounting for missing employees, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. The plan also includes procedures for notification of local agencies in the event of an incident, facility evacuation, and decontamination.  Finally, the plan discusses emergency preparedness and planning, including plans for conducting emergency response team training and drills."
