We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This Executive Summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n> A description of the Memphis Plant and use of chlorine, which is regulated by EPA's RMP regulation,\n> A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases,\n> An overview of our accidental release prevention programs,\n> A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chlorine,\n> An overview of our emergency response programs,\n> An overview of planned improvements at the Memphis Plant to help prevent accidental chlorine releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment,\n> The certification that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide, and,\n> The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program.\n\n2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nBuckeye Technologies Inc., Memphis Plant, produces purified alpha cellulose from cotton fibers (linters).  The Memphis Plant mechanically sizes, cleans, and fluffs raw cotton linters prior to combining with water.  This is then placed in a digester, which then uses steam and caustic soda to purify and reduce to raw slurry.  The raw slurry is then further purified prior to being delivered to one of the finishing (drying) operations.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as ha"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n> Process Safety Information\n> Process Hazard Analysis\n> Operating Procedures\n> Training\n> Mechanical Integrity\n> Management of Change\n> Pre-Startup Safety Review\n> Compliance Audits\n> Incident Investigations\n> Employee Participation\n> Hot Work & Safe Work Permitting\n> Contractor Safety\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps for chlorine:\n\n1. Chlorine Railcar Staging\na. Derailers, chocks, sign placements to prevent accidental movement\nb. Unique unloading site that is specific for chlorine\nc. Video monitoring of unloading area\nd. Automated railcar value closure system\ne. Enhanced security features to improve the overall security of the rail car unloading station.\n\n2. Hose and Gasket Leaks\na. Written Mechanical Integrity Program\nb. Color-coded lines/hoses\nc. Chlorine sensors that alarm on detection of chlorine vapor\nd. Video monitoring of railcar continuously\ne. Excess Flow Check Valves block flow if over pressurized\nf. Unique fittings prevent improper connections\ng. Daily Preventive Maintenance Checks of unloading system\nh. Numerous interlocks and redundant valves\n"

Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plans, including the Memphis/Shelby County LEPC and the Memphis Fire Department HAZMAT Response Team.  Joint training and drills have been conducted with each of these response agencies.  Our Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for:\n\n> Notifying the Memphis/Shelby County LEPC/EMA, Memphis Fire Department, and the surrounding community of an accidental release that could have off-site consequences,\n> Safely evacuating employees, contractors, and visitors,\n> Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment,\n> Maintaining a secure perimeter around the release area, and\n> Treating individuals exposed to the release.\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBuckeye has made several significant process safety improvements since the last revision.  We have several programs designed to review, audit, and test equipment and procedures.  These programs function to continually assess and improve hazardous systems.
