The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  .0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a 150 lb. CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. \n\nWith Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a 150 lb.

CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with FT. WAYNE  FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), and Hydrofluoric Acid. The Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide,  and Hydrofluoric are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 16,500 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), and Hydrofluoric Acid  are present at our facility in quantities of 7,410 lbs.,  and 38,500 lbs. respectively.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as RMP COMP VER 1.06, AND SAFER/TRACE.
