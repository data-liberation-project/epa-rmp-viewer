The accident release prevention policy of this facility is to reduce or eliminate releases through the training of personnel in the proper operating procedures and the proper maintenance of equipment. The policy is for employees to handle within their abilities  minor problems that do not require extensive safety equipment. The emergency response policy of this facility is to notify the employees and personnel living on the property and the Cherokee County law enforcement center. The enforcement center will contact the necessary emergency response personnel who will  complete any evacuations necessary.\n\n2.  Primary activities  of this facility include the storage of Anhydrous Ammonia for retail sale to farmers as a fertilizer. The maximum amounts of material stored would be 24.1 Tons of Anhydrous Ammonia. \n\n3. The worst case scenario for the Anhydrous Ammonia storage facility is the failure of the storage tank containing 9300 gallons of Anhydrous Ammonia with a 10-minute release interval. The distance to the end point is 4.0 miles where the level of Anhydrous Ammonia will be less than .14 mg/L ERPG-2 which is mandated by appendix A of part 68. \n The alternate release scenario for the Anhydrous Ammonia storage facility is a liquid fill pipe that is completely broken  with the excess flow valve functioning to limit the flow of 475  gal/min to 30% of that flow. The distance to the end point is .9 miles where the level of Anhydrous Ammonia will be less than .14 mg/L ERPG-2 that is mandated by appendix A of part 68.\n\n4. The general accident release program of this facility is to reduce or eliminate releases through the continuing training of personnel in the proper operating procedures, and the proactive maintenance of equipment. The standard for the operations and equipment in  the facility is the American National Standard K 61 for anhydrous ammonia storage.\n\n5. There have been no accidental releases from this facility.\n \n6. There is an emergency response plan, whic"
