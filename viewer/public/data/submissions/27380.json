      "SummaryText": "The Pleasant Prairie Facility, a coal fired fossil fuel electrical generating facility, has constructed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control process to control emissions of Nitrogen Oxides during the ozone forming season (May 1st through September 30th). The SCR process utilizes aqueous ammonia which is injected into the exiting flue gas (exhaust gas) from the boiler system. The ammonia reacts with the nitrogen oxides to form harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor. The SCR process requires ammonia to operate in an amount exceeding the threshold value contained in EPA's Risk Management Program to operate. Releases from the storage tank, which is diked, were evaluated as required by the Risk Management Program. The diked tank would minimize the pooled surface area created by a release, thereby reducing the amount of ammonia that could be released into the surrounding atmosphere.\n\nA worst-case release of aqueous ammonia from a storage tank within the diked containment area would result in a toxic endpoint radius of 0.3 miles as taken from USEPA guidance documents. An alternative-case scenario involves the rupture or uncoupling of a tanker truck transfer hose during delivery and results in a toxic endpoint radius of 0.1 miles as taken from USEPA guidance documents. Administrative controls, such as loading and tank filling procedures, are in place to limit the quantity of ammonia that could be released. The facility has not experienced any incidents with this substance as stated in response to USEPA's 5-year accident history requirements. \n\nThe facility's prevention and emergency response approach includes the implementation of USEPA's Risk Management Program, OSHA safety programs, and emergency response procedures developed specifically for the facility by the company and the Local Emergency Response Committee. Continuing employee safety training help ensure the ongoing commitment to continual safety improvement.\n\nThe facility has personnel trained in "
