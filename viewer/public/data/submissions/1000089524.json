Bendix Warehouse and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe Bendix Warehouse is operated Royal Adhesives & Sealants, LLC which is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of H.B. Fuller Company. Since 2016, the Bendix Warehouse serves as a distribution center and aerosol container filling process for its industrial adhesive products.\r\nThe facility is located on a 4.49-acre site and is in an industrial neighborhood on the West side of North Bendix Drive, in the Northwestern section of the City of South Bend, Indiana. The facility has only one occupant with two applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Codes which are NAICS Code 49311 (General Warehousing and Storage) and NAICS Code 32552 (Adhesive Manufacturing).\r\nThe 4.49-acre site contains approximately 64,500-square foot building that occupies much of the property. This facility operates five (5) days a week, with occasional overtime on the weekends, and is closed for US holidays. There are seasonal inventory fluctuations, but the employees normally work a day shift from 6 AM - 4 PM. Throughout most of the facility it operates as a chemical warehouse that receives, stores and ships chemicals used to manufacturer solvent and water-based industrial adhesives and sealants, commercial roofing adhesives, mirror mastics and epoxies as well shipping finished products to customers.\r\n\r\nIn the west side of the facility is the Aerosol Canister/Can Filling Line Process used to fill pressurized containers with adhesive products and flush products.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Bendix Warehouse facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source. \r\nThis facility is subject to Program Level 3 requirements including a management system, hazard assessment, and emergency response requirements. A management system has been developed and maintained that identifies personnel roles or job titles responsible for maintaining each element of the facility's Risk Management Program (RMP) including documentation, change communication and change implementation for applicable RMP program elements. Hazard assessments have been completed for worst-case scenarios and alternate case scenarios for the Aerosol Storage Area #1 and the Aerosol Canister/Can Filling Process. These scenarios have been reviewed during tabletop exercises with St. Joseph County Emergency Management Agency, South Bend Fire Department, South Bend Police Department, and other local responders resulting in the facility's implementation of an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with local responders.  \r\nProgram Level 3 requires a full prevention program similar to OSHA's PSM Standard including Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permits and Contractors.

Process safety information along with incident history and other applicable data including emergency response exercises with local first responders are all necessary to complete a thorough process hazard analysis. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\r\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively. The Zurich Hazard Analysis methodology, HAZOP methodology and along with a What If/Checklist method were used to identify hazards, determine risk for each hazard identified, and documented on a register to track findings which are addressed in a timely manner.

Examples of process equipment receiving ITPM include pressure vessels, storage containers, piping systems, fire protection/fire suppression system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Equipment deficiencies are corrected before further use of process equipment or whenever necessary to ensure safety. ITPM is performed by qualified personnel with previous maintenance training.

Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nThe facility initiates incident investigations in accordance 40 CFR part 68. Additionally, the Bendix Warehouse procedure specifies that all accidental releases be investigated since minor accident or near miss investigations may help identify problems that could result in major releases if left unaddressed. Incident investigation findings are promptly addressed to prevent recurrence. Velocity EHS is used to report incidents and audit findings and track action items to completion. The Corporate incident reporting procedure defines when a root cause analysis must be performed. H.B. Fuller uses the Cause Map methodology as the default methodology for root cause analyses. Other methodologies may be utilized at the discretion of the facilitator.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nH.B.
