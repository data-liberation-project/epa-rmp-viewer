Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nAdvanced Innovations East, LLC (AIE) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nAIE is an urethane foam manufacturing facility which produces various type of flexible urethane foam products located in Baldwyn, Mississippi. The facility will begin pouring operations in November 2011. The facility will fabricate some of the urethane foam into various finished products.\n\n\n\nFlexible urethane foam is a product made of combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in three (3) 12,000-gallons TDI Storage Tanks within the tank storage area. The three (3) TDI Storage tanks have a combined storage capacity of 36,000-gallons. The 36,000-gallons of TDI equates to 365,760 pounds of TDI.\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject "

Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nAIE's specific prevention steps include:\n\n\n\n1. Hazard reviews to identify, evaluate and control potential TDI process hazards,\n\n\n\n2. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process.\n\n\n\n3. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and   \n\n   emergency response personnel.\n\n\n\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n\n\n\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\n    \n\nC. Hazard Assessment:\n\nThe RMP requires AIE to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency resp"

The 12,000 gallons of TDI equates to approximately 121,920 lbs of TDI. The tanks are located within the main building and are surrounded by secondary containment which would fully contain a spill from a single tank, thereby reducing the evaporation rate of the spill.\n\nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's RMPcomp Model. The impact distance from the RMPcomp Model results and impact distance of 0.4 miles. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property.  Approximately 34 people live within the potentially affected area.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario.  AIE has determined that the appropriate alternative scenario for the facility is a process piping release from the process line carrying TDI from the tank to the pouring head. The leak would release approximately 1,080 lbs of TDI. The RMPcomp Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 mile for the alternative release scenario. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line. There are no people living within the potentially affected area.\n\n\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nProcess Safety Information: AIE will complete a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the Hazard Review. The Hazard Review will be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the TDI System. \n\n\n\nHazard Review: AIE will update and revalidate the Hazard Review as necessary and at least every five (5) years.
