(99.98% pure or better).  Ammonia was initially introduced on August 24th, 2006 and the process brought online on August 25th, 2006.  System was run by the contractor till pull down period was over on September 28th, 2006.  \r\nFacility has been maintained and operated safely since then.\r\nFacility adheres to OSHA 29CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management.  It also has an emergency action plan based on 1910.38.  \r\nFull response team including training per 1910.120, PPE, and a site plan has been formed with an emergency response team of four ammonia system employees.  Local response agencies including the fire department and hospitals have been contacted and information has been relayed as to the hazards of the process and necessary treatments and responses.  The Fire Department has been given tours of the facility for each shift and shown the emergency features and invited to partake in Mock Drills. We also went over our hazmat flag system with them which gives them not only directional information but wind speeds.   Last Fire Department onsite visit was 4-30-2012. \r\nWe based our worst case and alternate worst case on the EPA dispersion charts.   \r\nOur worst case encompasses an adjacent prison which operates a similar facility utilizing the same chemicals.  They have been notified of our chemical inventory and our worst case scenario.\r\nIIAR is the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration and is the leader in defining the rules and regulations to which the industry abides by.  This facility meets all IIAR requirements.\r\nThis facility was tested to the maximum working pressures and signed off on by the city inspector.  The system then was tested by use of vacuum and held for 1 week.  Once ammonia was inserted, testing with sulphur sticks occurred.  \r\nThe s"

      "SummaryText": "ystem was built to current codes and fully monitored and characterized within the facility and around the major leak points using electrochemical sensors and a control system that will isolate zones with in the system should a leak occur.  The system was built with new technology to aid in prevention of overpressurization called a crossover system.  It utilizes a pressure switch and solenoid to move refrigerant in the system from the high side to the low side.  We also have our relief valves with rupture discs.  This should minimize the release of ammonia from the system and prevent a catastrophic release.  This system and the locations of vessels inside a separate area should mitigate the release and allow the ammonia to escape through the ventilation system in the roof and outside at a height of 40'.  Ammonia rises in atmospheric conditions causing no ammonia to be located at ground level except within the sealed building.  \r\n\r\nAll technology was installed new and fully tested and was state of the art in 2007. Five Year mechanical integrity review completed in June 2012.\r\nAll SOP's were written and trained by a third party RETA CIRO and CARO operator for ammonia refrigeration and revised and review by the operators of Ben E. Keith.\r\n\r\nThere have been no releases in the facility's operating history.\r\n\r\nThe facility went through a Level 3 EPA Audit in February of 2011 with only minor documentation irregularities noted and corrected."
