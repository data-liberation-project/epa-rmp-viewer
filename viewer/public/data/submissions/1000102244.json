The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for the Plant is coordinated with The Rice County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the LEPC. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSafety meetings are conducted monthly where various safety issues are discussed and addressed, including safety specific training for the following topics (typically one per meeting):\n- industrial hygiene\n- hearing conservation\n- personal protective equipment\n- PSM overview\n- working in hot weather\n- DOT overview\n- handling of compressed gas cylinders\n- HazMat handling\n- Safety Integrity Plan changes and revisions\n- employee"

The program includes Classroom, OJT, and computer-based training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n \nManagement of Change: \nChanges are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n \nIncident Investigation:\nThe goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\n \nCompliance Audits:\nAudits are conducted on"

The total volume of the available cavern storage is fixed. However, each individual cavern may be used for more than one NGL, depending on marketplace requirements. Therefore, this RMP filing will be predictive.\n \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe Mitchell Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 2 Risk Management Plan (RMP).
