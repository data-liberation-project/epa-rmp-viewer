This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system only, including the associated piping and 87, 659 gallon storage tank.\n\nThis facility's worst case scenerio is the failure of the blending system's 87,659 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amout allowed (92.4% at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.6 miles and includes public  and environmental receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely) release scenerio is a \"pull away\" accidedent resulting in a one minute  pipe/hose release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site, but does not effect residential areas.\n\nThe Buckeye Partners L.P.- Hartsdale Station  complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
