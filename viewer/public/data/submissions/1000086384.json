The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if they happen.  It is the primary goal of 6th Street Cooling to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations. With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals are achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations.\r\n\r\n6th Street Cooling has adopted a non-responding facility policy but recognizes the need to be prepared for an emergency.  A California Hazardous Material Business Plan has been developed and submitted to the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) via the CA Electronic Reporting System (CERS).  The Plan is consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements and includes written regulatory release or threatened release notification requirements.  The Business Plan includes the Hazardous Material Inventory consistent with EPCRA compliance in California, and the information necessary to be included in the Area Emergency Plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established.
