      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nUpdate: June 2014\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Water Board uses chlorine gas for water disinfection.  This Risk Management Plan has been developed to identify and document the hazards associated with the storage, handling, and possible release of toxic chlorine gas.  The Water Board receives delivery of approximately 10 1-ton chlorine cylinders every four to five months, and as many as 13 1-ton containers may be stored within the Pony Creek Treatment Plant at any one time.  The EPA threshold quantity for gaseous chlorine applicable to the RMP regulations is 2,500 lbs.  The PCTP exceeds this threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from a Water Board chorine process within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\nOff-site consequences analysis was performed for a single worst case chlorine release scenario and a single alternative chlorine release scenario.  The areas impacted by such releases are shown on Figures 1 and 2 herein.  For the worst case scenario, a chlorine toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm chlorine may develop within a 2.63 mile radius of the PCTP.  Public receptors within the impacted area include schools, residences, a hospital, medical centers, public recreational areas including parks, pools, and sports fields, and major commercial, office, and industrial areas buildings.  The affected population for the worst case scenario is estimated at 21,000.\n\n\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, a chlorine toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm chlorine may develop within a 0.73 mile radius of the PCTP.  Public receptors within the impacted area include schools, residences, a hospital, medical centers, and some commercial and office buildings.  The affected population for the alternative release scenario is estimated at 1,300.\n\n\n\nThe prevention pro"
