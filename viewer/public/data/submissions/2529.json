Facility Policy for Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe Perryton Equity Exchange Directors, Management, and employees have a strong commitment to providing a safe and healthful workplace and business for all employees, customers, owners, and to the communities in which they operate.  These policies are set forth in a policy manual and are provided and explained to each new employee prior to an initial assignment.  The policies are reviewed periodically and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in policy, facilities, processes, regulations, safety requirements, or as new information becomes available.\n\nPerryton Equity Exchange is committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and other hazardous chemicals.  In the event that an accidental release does occur, they are prepared to work with the local fire department and/or designated contractors and local authorities to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release on the facilities, personnel, and to the community and environment.\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity of Perryton Equity Exchange is the purchase, receipt, storage, and sale of grains.  Secondary activities include the storage, sale, and application of some farm inputs and supplies, which include: fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, equipment, fuel, and other farm supplies.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received by transport truck, unloaded into storage tank(s), then distributed seasonally to farm wagons for sale and delivery to local farmers, where it is used as fertilizer to crops such as wheat, corn, and milo.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored at Perryton Equity Exchanges Liberal, Kansas, facility is 251,277 lbs. in a 30,000 gal. capacity and two 11,000 gal. capacity storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled at any one time would be the unloading of a transport truck holding 50,000 lbs. to a storage tank.\n\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank within a 10 minute time period.  The maximum quantity released would be 145,041 lbs., which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity, which is limited by regulation due to the expansion of anhydrous ammonia from changes in ambient temperatures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion under an atmospheric stability class F in an urban environment has been determined to be 4.2 miles.\n \n(b)  The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history and reports of industry incidents, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would be 2,943 lbs. and the distance to the endpoint for a 1 minute release under an atmospheric stability class D in an urban environment has been determined to be 0.28 miles.\n\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1-1989 published by the American National Standards Institute and the OSHA standards published in 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nA single reportable release of anhydrous ammonia occured at the Liberal, Kansas, facility on May 5, 1997, and was the only reportable release within the past 5 years.  Information regarding the release is as follows:  05/05/97; 11,000 pounds; 0 deaths; 0 injuries; 0 hospitalized; 3 employees and 5 workers from nearby businesses evacuated; no off-site environmental damage; Local Fire Dept. and LEPC responded; NRC report No. 386029.  Emergency shut-off valves were installed on each storage tank outlet within 30 days following the incident.\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nPerryton Equity Exchange has:\n(a)  a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with the OSHA standard 29CFR 1910.38.\n \n(b)  provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and c"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn accordance with Perryton Equity Exchange policies, safety improvements are an on-going process. Evaluations are performed to assess the safety of facilities, processes, and employees, periodically or immediately when reported by employees or the result of an incident.  Currently there are no specific additional safety recommendations for the anhydrous ammonia system, for implementation at this time."
