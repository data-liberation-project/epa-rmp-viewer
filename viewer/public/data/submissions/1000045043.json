This commitment is demonstrated by the incorporation of numerous prevention, detection and mitigation measures in the replacement chlorine process for which this Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared. CALM's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\n\n\nb. The RMP has been prepared to address the receipt, handling and use of chlorine at the CALM facility at 13329 Ector Street in the City of Industry. Chlorine is received by tank truck, stored in a 5,000 gallon capacity storage vessel and used in the resmelting of aluminum.\n\n\n\nc. CALM has a comprehensive release prevention program meeting RMP Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Physical Safeguards to prevent a release of chlorine including best industry practices for the design and construction of the chlorine storage vessel, equipment, piping and instrumentation, the use of expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping, and various procedural safeguards. \n\n\n\nd. CALM has an Emergency Shutdown (ESD) system for the chlorine process. The ESD is triggered by deviations in process parameters or detections of chlorine by chlorine sensors.  If chlorine sensors alarm at a warning level, staff can assess the situation.  If a potential emergency occurs, the ESD is activated.  If there is a release or imminent emergency,the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACFD) will be summoned and the facility will be promptly and safely evacuated.  LACFD will coordinate notification of offsite parties and response in an emergency.\n\n\n\n"
