Therefore, this Facility\n\nis subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal\n\nRegulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Pelican Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety\n\nManagement (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release\n\nscenario for the plant. Therefore, the Pelican Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR\n\n68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements\n\nrequired by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM.\n\nThe Pelican Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its\n\nreaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by\n\na fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an\n\nexposure of an environmental receptor.\n\nThe Pelican Plant employs 14 full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of\n\nthe Facility.\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink) last submitted a complete RMP 5-year update to the United States\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in February 2012 for the Pelican Plant. The current RMP includes\n\nadministrative updates associated with Pelican Plant.\n\n\n\n1.1 68.155(a) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Pelican Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction "

NGL is a\n\nregulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable\n\nchemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane,\n\nand N-pentane. The maximum inventory of NGL at the Facility at any given time is 130,304 gallons (510,766\n\nIbs). The largest vessel containing NGL at the Facility is 68,000 gallons (266,546 Ibs).\n\n1.3 68.155(d) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Pelican Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases\n\nof NGL or propane. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to\n\nthe prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. The Pelican Plants Prevention Program 3 elements, as\n\nrequired under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate\n\ndocument.

The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site specific\n\nand comprehensive, including the following elements:\n\n?h Public and emergency response agency notification procedures\n\n?h Proper first aid and emergency medical treatment\n\n?h Emergency response measures\n\n?h Procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment\n\n?h Employee training\n\n?h Program review procedures\n\nThe Pelican Plant maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance\n\nfor emergencies expected at the Facility. Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP. In addition,\n\noperating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility\n\nare maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the St. Mary Parish\n\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Patterson Fire Department.
