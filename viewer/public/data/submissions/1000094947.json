While some accidents may occur, we take great pride in our safety record and make every effort to ensure that they will be small and as infrequent as possible.\r\n\r\nEmployees of both Keane Refrigerated Logistics and its tenants have been trained specific to emergency response, HAZCOM (RTK) and Emergency Evacuation.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Training has been initiated and is an on-going program.  .\r\n\r\nThe West Deer VFW #3 Station 290 is located within two miles of the facility.  The Fire Chief and the local volunteer fire response team have inspected the facility conducting a walk thru and are prepared to assist and properly respond to an emergency situation should one occur.\r\n\r\nFuture plans for the on-going Risk Management program include routine preventative maintenance of mechanical refrigeration systems.

The facilities primary business is the short and long term storage of food products prior to distribution to grocery stores.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration process used to maintain cooler temperatures utilizes anhydrous ammonia (R717) as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is widely used as refrigerant in many industrial facilities, including, meat, poultry, and fish processing facilities; dairy and ice cream plants; fruit  juice, vegetable juice, and soft drink processing facilities; and cold storage warehouses.  The refrigerant serving as the heat transfer fluid is circulated thru a closed loop system.\r\n\r\nKeane Refrigerated Logistics is committed to operating cold storage facilities under conditions that are safe to employees, contractors, tenants, and the surrounding community.  The senior managements is committed to this cause.  As a result, the Safety Policy will be considered on an equal basis with productivity, efficiency, quality improvement, environmental issues and other policies developed by the Group.  To satisfy this core objective, the senior management team includes a member professionally trained to manage facility Safety and Risk Management Programs.\r\n\r\nThe core of the facilities overall approach to safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system focuses a hazard assessment program, employee and contractor training, an ongoing preventative maintenance program, and an emergency response program.  We use a variety of safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of releases should they ever occur.  Some examples include:\r\n\r\n*  Regular and Routine Process Hazard Analysis.\r\n*  Regular checklist audits of safety programs and records.\r\n*  Emergency release training with employee trained first responders and the fire department."
