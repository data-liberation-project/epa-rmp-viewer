At the Centralia, KS Facility, trained Helena personnel transfers anhydrous ammonia from its stationary pressure vessel to the nurse tanks in accordance with their facility specific RMP Operating Procedures. The full nurse tanks are then transported from the Centralia, KS Facility and back to the Home, KS Facility. At the Home, KS Facility, the Nurse Tanks are temporarily stored at the Facility property until\n\nretail sale to its customers. Empty Nurse Tanks are returned to the Home, KS Facility.",

Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Home, KS Facility located 1632 Pony Express Highway, Home, KS 66438. The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as a First Time Submittal. \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia in Nurse Tanks. This Facility owns and operates (8) 1,450-gallon nurse tanks; (2) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks; and (8) 1,000-gallon double nurse tanks. Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that is operated at this Facility. The covered process includes anhydrous ammonia Storage and Handling. The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the cont"

The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the storage and handling covered process as well. The alternative release for the Nurse Tank assumes a 60-minute release from a pressure relief valve that is not seated properly.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Branch Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed. The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency planning coordinator and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Home, KS Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena at the Home, KS Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency\n\nResponse Program has been coordinated with the Marshall County LEPC and the Marysville Fire Department.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to this Facil"
