      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  \n\n\n\nChlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  There are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination.  The breakpoint chlorination process consists of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) Alexander Orr Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and aqueous ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in finished drinking water, to protect public health and to comply with state and federal water quality standards.  \n\n\n\nStoring and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The Alexander Orr WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals seriously, as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\n\n\n\nThe Alexander Orr WTP chlorine handling processes is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and an update to the RMP every five (5) years.  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the chlorine process, including a description of the possible consequences if the procedures are not followed, and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of a chlorine release.\n\n\n\nThe following information is provided below in this RMP Executive Summary:\n\n    * Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.\n\n    * General Facility and regulated substance information.\n\n    * Summary of the accidental release prevention prog"

The plant is bounded by SW 64th Street, to the north, SW 87 Avenue to the east and by SW 72nd Street (Sunset Dr.) to the south. Alexander Orr WTP covers 68 acres.  The facility stores chlorine which is a regulated toxic substance under RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at the Alexander Orr WTP provides chlorine to the softened water to maintain required disinfection levels for drinking water.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Alexander Orr WTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP rule. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in Process Safety Management Standard.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered in  rail cars to a chlorine car enclosure. The rail cars contain liquid chlorine under pressure which is fed to two chlorine facilities designated as Chemical Plant 1 and Chemical Plant 2. The pressure from the stored chlorine in the rail car forces liquid chlorine through the tubing and into the chlorine feed line. During normal operation liquid chlorine flows from the rail cars through the chlorine pipeline to the evaporators located in the chlorinator room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is h"

Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas meter and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through rubber-lined ductile Iron piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\n\n\n\nThe Alexander Orr WTP chlorine systems are provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  Safety features include, but are not limited to emergency shut-off valves, chlorine leak detectors, audio and visual alarm system, isolation valves, high and low temperature alarms, high and low pressure alarms, pressure regulators, expansion tanks, bursting disks, and pressure relief valves.  Chlorine \"C\" Kits and personal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus are available in the event of a chlorine release.  These major safety features are located in the chlorine car enclosure and the chlorinator rooms.\n\n\n\nEmergency shut-off valves are located immediately after the rail car valve. Downstream of the manifold system there is also a pneumatically actuated emergency shut-off valve.  Pulling one of the emergency shut-off switches (kill switches) activates the emergency shut-off valves.  The emergency shut-off switches are located at the chlorine car enclosure and at the chlorinator rooms.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency shut-off valves in the chlorinator rooms are the same as those located in the chlorine car enclosure.

This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations evaluated, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Alexander Orr WTP investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in injury to personnel, injury to the public, damage to the environment, or property damage so that similar accidents can be prevente"

      "SummaryText": " employee safety, the public's health, and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (Fire Department, Miami-Dade Office of Emergency Management).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine release response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, site response team, and site safety representative, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all employees involved with the chlorination processes.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nNumerous changes to improve safety were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1997 for chlorination and system equipment and procedures, when Process Safety Management (PSM) Plans were prepared.  All of these recommended actions were evaluated for implementation as required. MDWASD is currently in the process of evaluating and implementing recommendations from the June 9-10, 2014 PHA.  \n\n\n\nMDWASD is committed to providing a safe and healthful work environment to its employees, while protecting the public, on-site and off-site property, and the environment from releases of chlorine.\n\n\n\n"
