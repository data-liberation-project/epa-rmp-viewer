Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas meter and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through rubber-lined ductile Iron piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\r\n\r\nThe Alexander Orr WTP chlorine systems are provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  Safety features include, but are not limited to emergency shut-off valves, chlorine leak detectors, audio and visual alarm system, isolation valves, high and low temperature alarms, high and low pressure alarms, pressure regulators, expansion tanks, bursting disks, and pressure relief valves.  Chlorine C Kits and personal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus are available in the event of a chlorine release.

The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  \r\n\r\nChlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  There are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination.  The breakpoint chlorination process consists of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) Alexander Orr Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and aqueous ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in finished drinking water, to protect public health and to comply with state and federal water quality standards.  \r\n\r\nStoring and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The Alexander Orr WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals seriously, as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\r\n\r\nThe Alexander Orr WTP chlorine handling processes is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and an update to the RMP every five (5) years.  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the chlorine process, including a description of the possible consequences if the procedures are not followed, and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of a chlorine release.\r\n\r\nThe following information is provided below in this RMP Executive Summary:\r\n\t* Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.\r\n\t* General Facility and regulated substance information.\r\n\t* Summary of the accidental release prevention prog"

The plant is bounded by SW 64th Street, to the north, SW 87 Avenue to the east and by SW 72nd Street (Sunset Dr.) to the south. Alexander Orr WTP covers 68 acres.

The leak detection system is set to activate the alarms when a chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm or higher is detected.  When the leak detection system detects a leak, both audio and visual alarms are activated.  When the chlorine alarms are engaged, personnel are restricted from entering the chlorine area without the appropriate personnel protective equipment.  A chlorine leak detection and alarm system like the one in the chlorine car enclosure is located inside the chlorinator rooms.  \r\n\r\nA perimeter fence and locked security gates surround the Alexander Orr WTP. Security cameras are located throughout the plant and are monitored both on-site and off-site. Security guards are posted at the entrances to the plant and unauthorized access is not allowed. There is also a roving security patrol of the perimeter fence. Employees are onsite 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\r\n\r\nThe Alexander Orr WTP is also provided with a backup emergency power generator that supplies power to the entire facility.\r\n\r\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe Alexander Orr WTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n\t* Detailed management system.\t\r\n\t* Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\r\n\t* Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\r\n\t* Performance of process hazard analysis (PHA) of covered processes, with operation and maintenance staff participation and review, and trained PHA facilitator.\r\n\t* Use of the-state-of-the art process and safety equipment and do"

      "SummaryText": "cumentation of equipment safety information.\r\n\t* Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operations and maintenance personnel, and safety staff.\r\n\t* Training of the all facility personnel, including management, operators and maintenance staff, security and all workers at the plant site.\r\n\t* Implementation of an incident investigation program.\r\n\t* Chemical-specific prevention steps including the  availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine,  presence of chlorine detectors and alarms, and remotely controlled shutoff devices on the chlorine storage tanks.\r\n\t* Comprehensive chemical data have been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazard, and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of chlorine. This information includes chlorine background information and MSDS sheets, along with process and chemical safety information.\r\n\t* Specifications for chlorine process are collected and provide in one place for easy reference. Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility. \r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nIn 1997, a detailed Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs) was conducted of the chlorine system process, including safety features, procedures, and maintenance.  The PHA was updated again in 2001, 2004 and 2009 and  recommended actions were developed to further improve safety.  An additional PHA was conducted in 2014 and recommendations are in the process of being evaluated and/or implemented.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures \r\nMDWASD Alexander Orr WTP has prepared written operating procedures that provide clear instruction and steps for safely conducting activities relating to the chlorination processes.
