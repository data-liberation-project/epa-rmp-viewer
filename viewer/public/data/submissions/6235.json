The Wiggins Coop Inc., Policy.\n\n     The management and employees of Wiggins Coop Inc., Byers facility are committed to the prevention of any accedental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the Wiggins Coop, is working to put in place a memorandum of understanding with the local fire department, on responding to and mitigating any release, thus minimizing the impact of a release to the community and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n    The primary activity at this site is storage for sales to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed.  The maximum quantity handled would be 56078 pounds in two vessels of 12000 and 8000 gallon total capacity.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tanker truck holding 40500 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenerio and the Alternate Release Scenerio.\n\n     The worst case release scenerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage vessel released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 56078 pounds. which represents the volume of the storage vessel at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is .84 miles.\n\n     The alternate release scenerio is based on the five-year accident history {or the likely potential incident} is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is .56 miles.\n\n4.  The Accident Release Prevention Program.\n\n     The Wiggins Coop Inc., has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1,  published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CRF 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.

The Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The Wiggins Coop Inc., Byers facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CFR 1910.38.}  The Wiggins Coop Inc., has privided to Colorado Emergency Planning Commission and the Arapahoe County local emergency planning committee the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III {EPCRA}.  The Wiggins Coop Inc., has a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CFR 1910.120}, including a memorandum of understanding with the Byers Fire Department for response to our facility.   Additionally, the Wiggins Coop Inc., has trained our employees in accordance with OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations {at least annually} will be preformed to access the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
