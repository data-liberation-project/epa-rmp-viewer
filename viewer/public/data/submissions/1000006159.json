      "SummaryText": "The DYCHO Company stores two (2) RMP Regulated Chemicals above Threshold Levels: Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  In the case of Chlorine up to 80,000# could be stored on site; In the case of Sulfur Dioxide up to 30,000# could be stored on site.  For both chemicals, DYCHO only stores the chemicals.  There is no Further Processing.  Either 1 ton (2,000#) or 150# cylinders are off loaded by the supplier(s) at the site.  DYCHO stores and then loads cylinders onto its delivery trucks for transport to its customers upon order receipt.  For both chemicals, and for both cylinder sizes, DYCHO has ACTIVE SENSORS TIED TO ALARMS.  For all practical purposes, by the time 2-5# of either Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide were released, the release will have been sensored, detected, and stopped.\n\nDYCHO management is fully committed to minimizing and preventing releases.\n\nChlorine Institute Pamphlet 162 and the EPA OCA Guidance Manual were used to develop this RMP.\n\nDYCHO certifies that there have been NO releases in the past five years.\n\nThe worst case release scenario, MANDATED BY EPA GUIDELINES, is that a 2,000 # cylinder of chlorine is released in 10 minutes.  An alternative scenario, more practical and more realistic, is that up to 15# is released over 10 minutes due to a faulty packing gland on a 150# cylinder.  The worst case release scenario modeled to endpoint distance is 4.4 miles.  The alternative release model to endpoint distance is 1.0 miles.  DYCHO has an EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN which has been reviewed by the local Fire Department which is the 911 Emergency Responder if needed."
