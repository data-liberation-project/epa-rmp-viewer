The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, \n(2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures,\n(4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits\n(e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Sunray Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nThe Sunray Gas Plant has long-standing safe wor"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of flammable substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe Sunray Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Sunray Gas Plant will promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Sunray Gas Plant has a program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Sunray Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of"

Crescendo is committed to worker and public safety at the Sunray Gas Plant along with all of it's operations.  This commitment is demonstrated by a strong management involvement and resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.   Numerous prevention and detection controls have been implemented to prevent a release of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur gas plant trained personnel would respond to control and contain the release according to the Sunray Gas Plant Response Plan, which includes notification of the public.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE &  REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\n \nThe Sunray Gas Plant is located in a rural area of Moore County, near Sunray, Texas.  The plant is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant which was constructed as a new facility with start up in late 1993.  Raw natural gas and condensate are processed into residue natural gas and a Y-grade natural gas liquids stream for sales.  The primary regulated substance contained in processes at the Sunray Gas Plant are flammable mixtures. Hydrogen sulfide is removed from some inlet raw natural gas and converted to elemental sulfur.  Hydrogen sulfide is a regulated toxic substance.  There are no processes at the Sunray Gas Plant that contain hydrogen sulfide above the regulated substance threshold.  None the less, numerous monitoring and control devices are in place to avoid a release of hydrogen sulfide.\n OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS:\n\nThere are five (5) processes at the Sunray Gas Plant that contain regulated flammable substances which are flammable mixtures.  All of the processes are program level I. There are no processes that contain toxic regulated substances above the regulated substances"

These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.  The most recent review was in 1998.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Sunray Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, \n(3) temporary operations (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and \n(6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Sunray Gas Plant provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information is included in written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform the job tasks.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Sunray Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their o"

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nThe Sunray Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner,\n(2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safety work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Crescendo evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nThe Sunray Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction"
