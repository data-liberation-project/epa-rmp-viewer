To ensure the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment, the Plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CCFR Part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Plant's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nDescription of Processes, and Regulated Substances Handled at the San Leandro Milk Plant\n\n\n\nThe San Leandro Milk Plant produces fluid milk and other products that require refrigeration.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the San Leandro Milk Plant.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: Liquid storage; Expansion; Evaporation; Compression; and Condensation.\n\n\n\nMechanical refrigeration is a physical process, rather than a chemical process: the ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the refrigeration cycle.  Heat is removed from the product being refrigerated or frozen as ammonia changes phase from liquid to vapor.  By reliquefying the ammonia vapor, the ammonia can be used continuously in the refrigeration cycle.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the San Leandro Milk Plant, which is subject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard, and the CalARP program).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nAt ambient temperature and pressure, ammonia is a colorless gas with a characteristic, irritating odor.
