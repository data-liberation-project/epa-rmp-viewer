      "SummaryText": "Berry Petroleum Company acquired the West Montalvo Field on 1 May 1990 from which it produces heavy crude oil and associated gas.  Included in the oil and gas operations at the West Montalvo Field is the removal of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) from the produced gas by means of a refrigeration process.  The NGL is stored in an 18,000 gallon capacity bullet tank until off-loaded to tanker trucks for subsequent sale.  Storage in the NGL tank is controlled to a maximum of 14,400 gallons or 70,170 pounds.  The storage of the NGL product is regulated under the federal Accidental Release Prevention Program (40 CFR 68) and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (19 CCR 2735 et seq.) because it exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for flammable mixtures.  This is a RMP/CalARP Program Level 2 facility.  The facility has implemented the prevention program described below.\n\nThe prevention program meets the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 and Title 19 CCR 2735 and includes the following: Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation.  \n\nTraining includes employee responsibilities in the risk management program, emergency response, safe work practices, and operating procedures.  Planned changes to improve safety have been established and will be based on results of compliance audits and revalidation of the hazard review.\n\nBerry Petroleum Company maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The plan consists of a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Ventura County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency as well as coordination with the Ventura County Fire Department for response to any NGL release.  The facility has also established a notification mechanism to ensure the Fire Department will be properly notified when response is required for an NGL release.

      "SummaryText": "emergency responders, the facility is not required to implement additional RMP emergency response program requirements.  The facility maintains an air pollution control district permit to operate with the Ventura Unified Air Pollution Control District.\n\nBerry Petroleum Company has a commitment to employee and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of covered processes.  Berry Petroleum\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, in the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the emergency responders.  \n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, the facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents/releases of NGL within the five years preceding this RMP submittal."
