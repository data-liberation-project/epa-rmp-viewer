Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Max Farm Service in Max, North Dakota are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Max Fire Department, and McLean County, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank, two 1,450-gallon nurse tanks and fourteen 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Max, North Dakota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 39,865 gallons (205,145.3 pounds) at 85% standard maximum storage capacity, including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  \n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nMax Farm Service maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chem"

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nMax Farm Service maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nMax Farm Service has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMax Farm Service conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Max Farm Service to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nMax Farm Service routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, eq"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nMax Farm Service has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\nMax Farm Service maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and in the event of an accidental release, Max Farm Service will contact local emergency response agencies and the public (Appendix A).
