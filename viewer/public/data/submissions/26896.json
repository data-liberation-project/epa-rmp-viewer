      "SummaryText": "The Miller Brewing Company is committed to promoting a safe working environment and has developed and implemented several programs to ensure chemical safety. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration process and has several methods for ensuring employee and public safety associated with this process.  The facility has developed procedures, plans and policies for the operation of the ammonia process and for dealing with unexpected accidental releases.  The Miller Brewing Company has implemented a process safety management program which enhances safety by regular maintenance and inspections, hazard analysis, compliance audits, employee and contractor training, employee participation, ammonia monitoring/detection, and other activities.  The facility also has emergency response procedures and plans to promote chemical safety in the event of an emergency situation.\n\nThe Miller Brewing Company engages in the production of malt beverages.   As part of the brewing process, an ammonia refrigeration system is utilized.  Due to the quantity of ammonia maintained on-site, the facility is subject to the Risk Management Program regulations which are intended to promote safety at the facility and general public level.\n\nA worst-case release scenario was modeled to determine the greatest impact a release of ammonia from the facility could reasonably cause.  This scenario is based on a complete and total release of ammonia from the largest ammonia vessel located at the facility.  At the Miller facility, this scenario involves a vessel which has an administratively controlled capacity of 17,600 pounds of ammonia (company policy limits the filling of the vessel to approximately 60% of its total capacity).  The worst-case release of ammonia from this vessel is a complete loss of all 17,600 pounds of ammonia in a ten minute period. A US EPA computer program was used to evaluate the potential  impacts from such a release.  The modeling indicates that the worst case release would impa"

The alternative release scenario is based on the failure of a high pressure receiver vessel on the roof of the utilities building which would result in an ammonia release of 7660 pounds of ammonia.  The alternative release scenario is a scenario which is more likely to occur, and would still have offsite consequences.   \n\nThe Miller facility is also subject to the Process Safety Management regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  As a result of these regulations, the Miller facility has implemented a program to further enhance process safety which involves operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity (maintenance related issues), pre-start-up-review, management of change, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work (welding) permits, and contractor safety.\n  \nIn the previous five years, the Miller Brewing Company facility in St. Clair Township, Ohio, has not had any accidental releases which resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage from the ammonia process. The facility utilizes the local 911 system to notify emergency responders of incidents requiring emergency responders."
