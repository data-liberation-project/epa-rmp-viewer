A. Parish Generating Station.\n\nGeneral Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance\n\nW. A. Parish Electric Generating Station is located in Thompsons, Texas.  The facility is a 3,800-MW electric generation facility consisting of eight steam electric generating units.  A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system is associated with each of the four coal-fired units.  The SCRs employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is an approximately 30% solution of ammonia in water.\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system at W. A. Parish is comprised of storage tanks, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The four tanks each have a capacity of 80,000 gallons but are administratively limited to holding 76,000 gallons.  Each tank is equipped with a pressure relief valve, a vacuum breaker valve with flame arrestor, and liquid level indicators.  \n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) prepared in support of this RMP utilized the methodologies recommended by EPA and employed in the RMP*Comp, Version 1.07 modeling system.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (WCS) considered the catastrophic rupture of one of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks, in which the entire contents of the tank are released within the secondary containment dike.  The secondary containment dike is large enough to contain the entire volume of"

      "SummaryText": " all four tanks and limits the exposed surface area of a pool, which reduces the release rate.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions of 1.5 m/s wind speed and atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), the resulting ammonia cloud could travel 1.1 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.  This worst-case impact distance extends offsite of the W. A. Parish facility and impacts offsite residences and small industrial areas.  The WCS does not impact any offsite institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), recreational areas, major commercial areas, or environmental receptors.\n\nSeveral alternative release scenarios (ARSs) were considered including releases due to a failed delivery hose, a failed pipe between the ammonia transfer pumps and the ammonia supply header for the vaporizers, a failed pipe between the ammonia supply header and a vaporizer, and a corrosion-caused hole in piping.  The release due to a failed delivery hose resulted in the farthest impact distance (0.3 miles)  and is the ARS presented in this RMP.  The impact due to this ARS does not extend offsite of the W. A. Parish facility and, therefore, does not impact any offsite residences, institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), recreational areas, major commercial areas, or environmental receptors.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nA five-year accident history is not applicable, since this is a new process at the facility that has yet to commence operations.\n\nSummary of Prevention Program 2\n\nW. A. Parish is covered by an accidental release prevention program, which includes the following:\n? Periodic hazard review and updates\n? Periodic audits of the system and its operation\n? Emergency response plan coordinated with local responding agencies\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system prevention program includes the following components:\n?

Incident investigation\n\nSummary of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response plan for the ammonia storage and handling system has been developed and incorporates elements of the facility?s Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  W. A. Parish employees have been trained in this plan and would be the first responders in the event of an emergency. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA hazard review of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at W.A. Parish was conducted as part of this RMP.  This is a new process, and there are not any planned changes to the system at this time."
