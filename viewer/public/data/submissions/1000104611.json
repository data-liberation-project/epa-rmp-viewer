This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, flame retardant clothing and first aid equipment. An inspection, testing and maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment. Fire extinguishers are inspected monthly and receive annual maintenance per the international fire code. Inspection reports for emergency response equipment are filed onsite.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Romulus Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the City of Romulus Fire Department and request their assistance. The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire capability. The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the City of Romulus Fire Department and LEPC. The Wayne County Homeland Security and Emergency Management and Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport also maintain a full hazardous material response team, are aware of the Facility's butane blending system access and sources. Romulus Terminal maintains a vegetation control program to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the system.\r\n\r\nThe Facility also maintains a relationship with the City of Romulus Fire Department. Tours and drills with members of local emergency response organizations are held routinely. These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the terminal."

All elements of the submittal have been verified and updated as applicable and the worst-case and alternative scenarios have been reevaluated. The modeling reevaluation did not result in an increase in the off-site impact of the Butane Blending system as measured by the distance to end point of the worst-case scenario and the population affected .  Due to a recent change in company policy, the maximum intended inventory was changed as a part of this resubmission. Previous practice was to include the operational safeguard that restricted the butane storage vessel to 85% capacity. While that control is still in place, current company policy is to assume that the vessel is 100% full for RMP related calculations. This resulted in an increase of approximately 40,000 lbs. of butane but was not significant enough to alter the worst-case scenario. \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RELEASE POLICIES\r\n\r\nSunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals L.P. - Romulus Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Romulus, Michigan.

STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the Romulus Terminal is to act as a refined petroleum distribution facility. The Butane Blending process has been classified as Program level 3. No Program level 1 or Program level 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified at Romulus Terminal. Due to the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Romulus Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Romulus Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) 59,784-gallon storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-lo"
