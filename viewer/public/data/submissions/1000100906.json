The facility has never had a site accident with these chemicals since construction of the facility. \r\nAll employees have received training on the standard operating procedure to follow if a chlorine leak were to occur. Evacuation drills are held. Response coordination with the local Township 7 FD is conducted and is backed up by the NC Regional Hazardous Material Response Team. We also provide the Fire Department with Tier II notification of our inventory on a yearly basis. Amerochem has several Chlorine Institute Emergency A-Kits and cylinder salvage vessels on site and has provided safety and emergency response training to operators and fire departments in much of Eastern NC. Amerochem is also a direct subscriber with CHEMTREC.\r\nThe company is planning to expand the storage area to further isolate the cylinders farther from any possible heat source.\r\nNote to EPA:        As the operator we have held that the isolation of the cylinders that are toxics, not flammable, and construction of the DOT cylinders makes these cylinders not subject to the co-located guidance concerns , the NCDEQ requested this be filed under their interpretation of the general duty clause.

The New Bern facility repackages a variety of chemicals and warehouses many others. Safe handling and shipment is critical for our employees, our customers, and the surrounding communities.  The company has several employees with over thirty years of experience in the safe handling of chemical products. We employ eighteen-  including six highly trained hazmat drivers.  These drivers also handle chlorine cylinders for delivery.  This gas, which can be toxic in high concentrations, are critical to providing safe water for many localities in NC. The facility operates approximately 12 hrs. per day and has 24 hr. surveillance The proximity to the Creekside recreational area requires a high level of care even if the risk of off-site effects are extremely unlikely.  In the past twenty years there have been no facility accidents involving a reportable release of these chemicals.\r\nThe chlorine cylinders are received from the supplier, leak checked, and stored in secured cages.  The products are liquefied gases under low pressure (25-125 psi).   The cylinders are DOT specification heavy-walled cylinders that are not opened or modified by Amerochem. They are built to withstand normal and accident conditions incident to transportation. Our supplier inspects the cylinders each time they are filled and hydrostatically tests every 5 years to 500 psi.  Chlorine Institute training materials are used and are the source of the written procedures, Safety Data Sheets and Safety checklists that are used by the supplier and Amerochem.\r\nSince there is no inter-container transfer, the only threat of release from these robust transportation cylinders would be from a release from the fusible valve plug  that activates at 160 deg F in a fire.  In addition, trace leaks may result from faulty supp"
