      "SummaryText": "    Introduction\n\nUSEPAA?s RMP regulation (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP regulation applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under A?68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release. Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA PSM standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.  The Harry E. Myers Water Filtration Plant (Myers Plant) processes do not meet the Program 1 criteria, are not subject to the OSHA PSM standard, and are not classified in any of the Program 3 NAICS codes; therefore, the facility is subject to Program 2 requirements.\n\nThe Mobile Area Water and Sewer System (MAWSS) operates the Myers Plant, which is located at 1475 Hubert Pierce Road in Mobile, Alabama. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for treated surface water. The facility stores approximately eight one-ton containers of chlorine. Since the Myers Plant utilizes more than the threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process, the facility is required to submit an RMP as defined in A?68.150.  The initial RMP was submitted as required by June 21, 1999.  To comply with the five-year update requirement, the offsite consequence analyses have been reviewed to determine whether the parameters and assumptions used are still valid and to make any necessary changes to update the RMP.\n\nUSEPA"

The following represents the executive summary, summarizing the items required as described in A?68.155 (a) through (f).\n\n\n    A?68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of the Myers Plant chlorination system, the facility depends on the commitment and team effort of its employees and suppliers. \n\nThe Myers Plant has established procedures to ensure the integrity of the chlorination systems and minimize the potential for releases.  Standard protocols have been established for items such as system operations, maintenance, training, and incident investigation. \n\nThe Myers Plant has a minimum of one and a maximum of nine employees on duty at any given time. The employees are trained on safe operation of the chlorination systems.  Daily inspections of the areas storing and/or using chlorine are conducted by the facility employees.  The area that stores the ton containers is fully enclosed and is equipped with a caustic scrubber for control of a chlorine release.  The caustic scrubber system is equipped with chlorine detectors that will automatically activate the scrubber system if a chlorine concentration of three ppm or greater is present.  In addition, MAWSS has installed an emergency chlorine valve actuator, which will shut off flow from the ton containers within 1.5 seconds after detecting a leak. The system also contains an emergency A?panic buttonA? located outside of the storage area to allow for operator-initiated emergency shut-off.\n\nAll potential releases from the Myers Plant facility will be responded to by the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency (MCEMA), whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine at the facilities. The MCEMA would dispatch experienced HAZMAT personnel trained to respond to such emergencies.\n\n\n    A?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is th"

A header pipe supplies chlorine to two locations: to the chlorine dioxide generator system and to the chlorine feed point at the plant filter flume. The containers are delivered to the site to a location just outside the building.  The containers are then moved inside the building for storage and use.  In addition to the four connected containers, up to four additional ton containers, which may be empty or full, are stored inside the building.  \n\nGaseous chlorine from the ton containers is drawn by a vacuum through one of two rotometers, which serve to feed chlorine at a specified rate to the ejector system. Here, the gaseous chlorine is mixed with treated water (pumped to provide a higher pressure for injection) to form a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is injected into the water at the filter flume feed point. The water is then distributed for use by the residents of the City of Mobile.\n\n\n    A?68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention \n\nAs required for Prevention Program 2 processes, one worst-case release analysis and one alternative release scenario, has been conducted.  In addition, emergency response activities have been coordinated with local responders, which is also required for Program 2 processes. Also as required, a program and document management system is in place.\n\nProgram 2 allows streamlined prevention program requirements; however implementation of the following elements are required: safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations. \n\nMalcolm Pirnie, Inc., with the assistance of Myers Plant management and staff familiar with the processes operation and maintenance, conducted a compliance audit as part of the RMP update in January 2005.
