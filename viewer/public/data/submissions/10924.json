Our facility also follows the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  Employees responsible for the processing, handling, and storage of regulated materials are required by company policy to complete extensive training, both classroom and on-the-job, before being allowed to perform sensitive operations.  This involves operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  Employees also receive periodic refresher training, such as the conducting of regular monthly safety training and refresher courses at this facility, to maintain skills and awareness.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan includes specific instructions for employees and contract personnel to follow in the event of an accidental release.  Activation of this plan will place in motion a series of events specifically designed to minimize the impact of the release to our employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.\n\nIf an emergency were to occur at our facility, it is our policy to activate our Emergency Action Plan.  Through the activation of this plan, emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly.  The 911 call is channeled through the Clarke County Sheriff's Department, on to the Pachuta Volunteer Fire Department and the Quitman Volunteer Fire Department, and all area emergency response agencies.\n\nA facility description and the regulated products handled:  Magnolia Resources Gas Plant is a natural gas liquid extraction LP-Gas processing facility with LP-Gas mixture and LP-Gas storage and sales to wholesale markets"

The facility consists of two (2) 40,000 gallon propane storage tanks, two (2) 40,000 gallon butane storage tanks, 30,000 gallon and 25,000 gallon LP-Gas mixture storage tanks, and a 2,200 gallon propane storage tank with their associated piping, valves, pumps, compressors, etc. on site.  Propane, the butanes (LPG), and the NFPA-4 LP-Gas mixture are the regulated substances handled as part of the LP-Gas storage and sales process.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):  Our worst-case scenario is failure of a 40,000 gallon butane storage tank when filled with the greatest amount allowed (88 % of capaciity at 60 degrees F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  There will be off-site consequences.  This incident carries a very low degree of probability compared to other more probable incidents.\n\nOur alternative release scenario involves a pipe on the discharge of the pump breaking during the loading process resulting in 11,000 lbs of butane being released with a vapor cloud explosion occurring.  This incident carries a slightly higher degree of probability of occurrence than our worst-case scenario and there will be limited  off-site consequences.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention rule and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This natural gas liquid extraction processing and liquified petroleum gas handling and storage facility is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law utilizing ASME, ANSI, and API codes and guidance.  This facility has in place an active SPCC plan developed in accordance with 40 CFR 112.7 and an OSHA Process Safety Management program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nFive year accident history:  In the past five years Magnolia Resources Gas Plant has not experienced an incident involving LP-Gas mixture and liquified petroleum gas that c"

Activation of this emergency response plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events which notifies all area emergency response agencies.  Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly.  The 911 call is channeled through the Clarke County Sheriff's Department.  All agencies and personnel respond to predetermined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the Central Command Post (CP).  A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with other emergency response personnel from responding agencies, as needed.\n\nEmployees of this facility are issued individual copies of the Emergency Action Plan when initially hired and the plan is reviewed in a timely manner.  Updates to the plan are provided to all employees and the Emergency Action Plan is exercised in regular drills involving all facility personnel.  This Emergency Action Plan and drill have been reviewed by the Emergency Management District Director and deemed to be acceptable.  All of our operators at this facility have had the appropriate emergency response training as mandated by the OSHA standard.  This plan and our emergency response policy have also been discussed with the local fire departments and members of the fire departments have inspected our facility.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  None"
