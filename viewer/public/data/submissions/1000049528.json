              "Description": "The Town of Somerset Water Pollution Control Facility prior to acceptance of any chlorine containers visually checks each container for chlorine leaks, and any transport damage.  Each container once accepted is then placed within the chlorine container storage room and logged in on the chlorine inventory sheet when put into service.  All container data is noted on a daily inventory sheet.\n\n     Two trained personnel are required for the unloading and loading of chlorine containers, using approved procedures of the Chlorine Institute. Each time a chlorine container is put into service, the attending operator checks all connections for leaks with ammonia solution prior to placing the chlorine container on line.\n\n     The Town of Somerset Water Pollution Control Facility provides employees a chlorine safety-training seminar annually, which is conducted by the chlorine supplier in which all employees who could potentially handle chlorine are required to attend.\n\n     All chlorine equipment is placed on an annual maintenance program which is completed by the equipment representative who is trained in the maintenance and operation of this specific chlorine equipment; and is also trained in chlorine handling and chlorine safety. All equipment including \"standby equipment\" is inspected and tested each year. All equipment is tagged with its inspection date and its next inspection service date. All equipment which has been in operation is removed from service, taken apart and inspected, then is rebuilt using new parts and tested per manufacturer's instruction. In addition, plant personnel make daily and weekly inspections of the chlorine process.\n\n     Entries to the chlorine building are locked to prevent unauthorized access. The area is marked and posted \"Danger Chlorine\", and both the chlorine container storage room and the Chlorination Feed Room have been equipped with ventilation system which was redesigned, upgraded and put into service in 1990. Chlorine detectors are instituted in the Chlorine Building which monitors atmosphere. These monitors are encompassed in our routine preventative maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe Treatment Facility constantly updates all MSDS sheets and provides the employees the opportunity to review. MSDS sheets are available throughout the facility. With the proper training and preventative maintenance of the chlorine process both the employees and the community will be provided with a safer environment.\n\n\n\n-Chlorine detectors\n\nAnnual maintenance\n\nHorn and alarm 24 hour alarm\n\nDaily, weekly and monthly varies with maintaining service\n\nTwo personnel load/unload\n\nCheck cylinders upon delivery\n\nTest for leaks when connections are made\n\nTest ventilation system\n\nAnnual training of personnel\n\nDoors locked\n\nMSDS sheets",

At this Facility sewage is processed at an average rate of approximately three and one-half million gallons per day.  Liquid chlorine is received in one-ton containers for use in its process for disinfecting which is later dechlorinated with Sodium Bisulfite before discharge into the Taunton River.  Containers are shipped in two one ton containers per shipment for the facility and the maximum amount stored in the facility is 6,000 pounds.  We order chlorine containers when two containers are empty, and one full container is on line.  All records of chlorine deliveries and empty containers shipped back are kept in file via bill of lading invoices.\n\n     Chlorine is fed at a rate of approximately fifty pounds per day in our treatment process, and is always withdrawn as a gas.  The containers are received and the unloading of containers and their connection to the feed system is performed by two (2) individuals who have been trained in chlorine handling, chlorine safety, and follow developed policies and procedures for these tasks\n\n     Start-up training on all components of the chlorine feed equipment was conducted during 1990 when the treatment facility was renovated and new equipment was installed.  At that time all employees were trained on this feed equipment along with system operation, chlorine safety, and troubleshooting.  The department has an annual service contract to provide for the repair and preventative maintenance of all components of the chlorine feed system including chlorine detection equipment. The department inventories repair parts and preventative maintenance kits to service the crucial components of the Chlorination system.\n\n     Periodic safety audits are performed by the Fire Department along with safety reviews. Equipment and process inspections are done by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection inspectors and private s"

We provide annual safety training on the use of chlorine, and its risks. We have develop and implement department policies in an effort to eliminate any risk of accidental release at this facility.\n\n     Chlorinating is accomplished through a gas chlorination system using ejectors to draw the chlorine gas from the pressurized containers through a control valve and a rotometer to regulate the chlorine dosage. The chlorine is mixed into a flow of plant water to produce the required chlorine solution. The chlorine solution will have the same pressure as the plant water. The amount of chlorine applied is automatically proportioned by the rate of flow through the Parshall flumes, adjusted for flow equalization."
