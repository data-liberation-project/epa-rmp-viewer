The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq.  The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  Finally, both CalOSHA and Federal OSHA regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the Process Safety Management regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility.  Many state-of-the-art safety features have been incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on backup support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team.  Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.\r\n\r\nThe Livingston NCDC 2 is located at 655 Davis Street in Livingston, California on approximately 32 acres.  The facility is approximately \u00bc mile east of State Highway 99 in the northeast portion of Livin"

Residential properties and other Foster Farms facilities are also located near the site.  The Merced River is approximately \u00bd mile north-northwest of the facility.  Retention basins and unimproved property lie to the north- northeast of the facility.  Railroad tracks border the facility on the west.  Agricultural lands generally surround the Livingston area.  The location is shown on Figure 1 \u00bf Vicinity Map.\r\n\r\nOperations at the facility consist of the storage and shipment of poultry products.  The facility receives poultry meat and other food preparations from other Foster Farms sites and suppliers.    Refrigeration is required throughout the process, including poultry meat storage areas, product storage areas as well as the receiving and shipping areas.  Evaporative coolers (closed system units supplied with ammonia refrigerant) will accomplish most of this cooling.  Freezing will be required for some of the product and thus the facilities include blast freezers for quick freezing and evaporative cooling for cold storage areas.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.  The ammonia refrigeration system, which is designed as a closed system, contain approximately 60,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia once the system is completed.  Initial startup charge of ammonia for the system is approximately 48,000 pounds. The system provides cooling for product storage.  A central computer system monitors and controls the refrigeration system.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, circulating pumps, and compressor controls.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.

      "SummaryText": "RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention programs and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The major pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves that discharge to a water filled tank. Ammonia from the vessels can be mixed with water (neutralized) in the diffusion tank and discharged to the sewer system to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels.\r\n\r\nOther safety features at the facility include: \r\n- emergency shutdown systems\r\n- component specific safety shutdowns\r\n- safeties will be tested annually\r\n- pressure relief valves have been installed on all vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure\r\n- pressure relief valves have been vented to a common header connected to the water diffusion system, designed to mix vented ammonia with water for safe disposal to the municipal sewer \r\n- ammonia pipes, valves and components have been labeled\r\n- pressure relief valves will be replaced at least every five years\r\n- a fire sprinkler and alarm system has been installed in the plant\r\n- a central computer system monitors the refrigeration system and alarm when safety set-points are exceeded\r\n- ammonia leak detection system have been installed which provides early warning alarms for the process areas and can automatically shutdown the refrigeration system if engine room leaks are detected\r\n- operators receive ongoing training in operations, mainten"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency response training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program.  Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) are being prepared for the ammonia system at the facility and will be completed prior to startup.  The SOPs provide a basis for site-specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A preventive maintenance system has been developed to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Preventive maintenance at the facility will include daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment.  The preventative maintenance system will be used to track equipment performance and to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\r\n\r\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing as part of Foster Farms commitment to continuous improvement.  A process hazard analysis revalidation was recently conducted on the ammonia refrigeration system to identify further safety improvements.  Many of the mitigation measures suggested by the most recent process hazard analysis team have already been implemented.

Management responses and support will be consistent with Foster Farms' commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility.  As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farms continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community.  Foster Farms will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations.  However, minor improvements / modifications to the RMP/PSM, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Foster Farms\u00bf internal review practices, and Foster Farms will maintain the most current versions on site.  Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM, related documents, and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."
