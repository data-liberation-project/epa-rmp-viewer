Our commitment is demonstrated by the resources we have invested to ensure that our processes are safely designed, operated and maintained by qualified personnel.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical accidents.  However, if a chemical release does occur, our trained personnel will respond in coordination with emergency responders from Baltimore City and the Maryland Department of the Environment to mitigate the release and protect public health and the environment.\n\nSASOL North America is committed to the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care(r) initiative for safe management of chemicals.  The Responsible Care(r) Codes of Management Practices are integral to SASOL North America's Environmental, Health and Safety policy.  In particular, the Responsible Care(r) Community Awareness and Emergency Response Code is designed to assist emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know, and the Process Safety Management Code is designed to prevent chemical accidents.\n\nSASOL North America's Baltimore plant uses by-products from petroleum refinery operations to produce linear alkylbenzene (LAB) and other specialty chemicals.  LAB is used in the production of household detergents.  The Baltimore plant uses hydrogen chloride gas to promote chemical reactions within the LAB process.  Hydrogen chloride gas is a regulated toxic substance.  The Baltimore plant also uses pentane as a processing aid within the LAB process.  Pentane is a regulated flammable substance.\n\nThe worst case scenario for a regulated toxic substance at the Baltimore plant involves catastrophic failure of a full hydrogen chloride gas cylinder and release of 3,100 pounds of hydrogen chloride gas.  The USEPA's RMP Comp software was used to estimate the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint (0.03 milligrams per liter).  The maximum distance to thomments, and forwarded to managem"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options that are implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperators, supervisors and plant engineers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures.  These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed.  At the Baltimore plant, operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n? Steps for safely conducting activities\n? Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n? Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment required and steps to take if exposed to a particular chemical.\n\nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Baltimore plant trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training.\n\nAll new operators receive several weeks of comprehensive training before being assigned to a specific operating position.  This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and compressors, a general overview of the process, properties of hazardous substances in the process and a detailed review of complex procedures such as safe work practices and emergency response.

When the new hire has demonstrated, through hands-on demonstration in the field, mastery of process specific operating procedures for specific tasks, he/she is allowed to begin work in a specific operating position.\n\nRefresher training covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Demonstration in the field is used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process.  Operators are consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training.  Recommendations are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Management of Change procedure at the Baltimore plant evaluates all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, procedures and controls within covered processes to help ensure that a change does not adversely affect the safety of plant operations.  Proposed changes are reviewed and approved by qualified personnel, process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the change.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Baltimore plant conducts a safety review of new and modified processes before the process is placed in service.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that processes, procedures and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to startup.  The review provides an additional check to make sure that construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

A PSSR involves field verification of construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Baltimore plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, emergency shutdown systems and rotating equipment (pumps and compressors) in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) maintenance procedures, (2) personnel training in maintenance procedures, (3) equipment inspections and testing, (4) correction of identified deficiencies, and (5) quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, equipment is repaired in a timely manner.  All outstanding deficiencies are tracked until corrective action has been implemented and documented.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Baltimore plant incorporates quality assurance into equipment purchase and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Baltimore plant has a long-standing safe work program in place to ensure worker safety.

The team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to ensure safe operation of the plant.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved and appropriate enhancements are made to plant operations.\n \nContractors\n\nThe Baltimore plant has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of contractors to ensure only contractors who can perform the desired task safely are hired.  The plant communicates to contractor supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, Baltimore plant safe work practices and Baltimore plant emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that contractor supervisors train each of their employees on hazards and procedures specific to the Baltimore plant.  The plant periodically reviews contractor training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Baltimore plant experienced two accidents during the last five years that involved regulated substances and resulted in on-site injuries and/or property damage.  On October 13, 1998 a chemical reactor overpressured and failed catastrophically during performance of a process shutdown procedure.  A mixture of hydrogen chloride gas, hydrogen and combustible hydrocarbons was released from the reactor and ignited.  The subsequent fire injured five workers on-site and damaged the LAB process unit.  Based on video footage of the fire, emissions modeling, forensic evidence and failure analysis by expert consultants, no persons off-site were exposed to harmful quantities of toxic concentrations, radiant heat or overpressure.  The Baltimore City Fire Department immediately responded and extinguished the fire.  There was no need to evacuate or shelter-in-place persons off-site, and there was no"

      "SummaryText": " property damage or environmental damage off-site.  The principal cause of this accident was human error.  On March 24, 2000 a chlorine tankcar unloading hose developed a pinhole leak when it was placed in operation.  The hose was immediately removed from service.  An operator standing near the leak was briefly exposed to chlorine vapors and required medical treatment.  There was no need to evacuate or shelter-in-place persons on-site or off-site, and there was no property damage or environmental damage.  The principal cause of this accident was mechanical failure.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Baltimore plant emergency response program has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response, and notification requirements of the following regulations:\n? OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 (a) - Employee Emergency Action Plans\n? OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) - Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER)\n? OSHA 29 CFR 1910.110 (n) - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\n? OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart L - Fire Protection\n? EPA 40 CFR Part 302.6 - Notification Requirements\n? EPA 40 CFR Part 355.40 - Emergency Planning and Release Notification\n? EPA 40 CFR Part 68 - Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Program\n? EPA 40 CFR Part 355.30 - Facility Coordinator and Emergency Response Plan\n? EPA 40 CFR Part 112 - Facility Response Plan\n? EPCRA 302 - List of Extremely Hazardous Substances\n? Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 154 Subpart F - Facility Response Plan\n\nThe emergency response strategy for the Baltimore plant is to prevent and/or control emergency situations via the use of engineering, design and fixed protection systems.  Plant personnel, in combination with the Baltimore City Fire Department, are available 24 hours per day and trained to respond and take actions to contain, control and mitigate any release that might occur.  Emergency responders have access to on-site and off-site emergency equipment that is appropriate for situations that"

In addition to the considerable on-site resources, the Baltimore plant is a member of the South Baltimore Industrial Mutual Aid Program (SBIMAP).  This membership allows the plant (if needed) to draw on the emergency response resources of other industries in the immediate area.\n\nDrills are periodically conducted either individually or jointly with the LEPC and SBIMAP to assess emergency response at the Baltimore plant and/or the surrounding district.\n\nThe Baltimore plant is a participant in the community planning process cooperating with the Baltimore City Local Emergency Planning Committee.  A copy of the plant's Emergency Response Plan has been forwarded to the Baltimore City Fire Department per the requirements of 40 CFR 355.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Batimore plant constantly strives to improve safety and reduce risk through auditing, suggestions from employees, incident investigations, advancements in technology and the use of engineering standards and specifications.  For example, new process technology was installed in 2002 that eliminated chlorine use in the LAB process."
