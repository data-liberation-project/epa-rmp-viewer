The PHA team must have as its core members a trained PHA Facilitator and experienced Operations and Engineering representatives.  Other subject matter experts, such as refinery fire department personnel, mechanics, inspectors, equipment reliability specialists, environmental specialists, may also participate as needed.\n\n  \n\nThe PHA team considers the possible causes and potential consequences of deviations to identify hazardous conditions, analyze existing safeguards, and make recommendations for changes where appropriate. The PHA team uses the CUSA Integrated Risk Prioritization Matrix, to assess the severity, likelihood and relative risk of each cause-consequence scenario. The PHA documentation is retained for the life of the process plus 30 years.\n\n\n\nApproved methodologies are used to conduct PHAs at the Richmond refinery, and are selected based on the complexity of the process. Checklists are used to conduct Latent Condition reviews, External Event Reviews, and Inherently Safer Systems reviews during PHAs.\n\n\n\nPHA recommendations must be completed within one year, or if a shutdown is required, the recommendation must be completed during the next regularly scheduled shutdown unless it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of Contra Costa Health Services that such a schedule is infeasible. In some cases, short term mitigation may be considered to reduce the risk until the risk is fully mitigated. \n\n\n\nRecommendation resolutions are tracked and managed in the Knowledge Management System (KMS) database.

The Refinery and all contract companies are jointly responsible for safety and must ensure that contractor's employees are trained in and understand the following:\n\n- Work practices necessary to perform the job;\n\n- Hazards associated with a process;\n\n- Applicable sections of the emergency response procedure; and\n\n- Applicable safe work practices\n\n\n\nCUSA's contractor safety management program employs a system of controls which requires contractors to meet CUSA's standards and expectations for supporting safe facility operations to protect contractors, employees, the community and the environment. The Refinery requires that potential contract companies complete and return a pre-qualification questionnaire regarding their safety programs to Contracts Administration for review against established criteria. The questionnaire includes confirmation that the company has an established written safety program, jo"

Metrics, such as Total Recordable Incident Rate, are also considered when selecting contract companies. Contracts Administration may also request that the contract owner submit additional documentation, such as safety training records/logs. The contractor office audit process also includes verification of appropriate skills and certification required to perform the job. Contract companies found to be acceptable against the established criteria are then logged into the \"Preferred Contractors\" list. The Contractor Health Environmental Safety Management (CHESM) database maintains files of the completed questionnaires and any additional information requested.\n\n\n\nContractor employees from the \"Preferred Contractors\" list are required to receive refinery instruction training before being allowed on-site. Each contractor employee must complete a course in general Refinery safety conducted by the Bay Area Training Corporation/DISA (BATC) or OSCA which offers DISA/Nor-Cal/LA Refinery Safety Orientation (DSOP/NCRSO/LARSO). In addition, each contractor employee must complete a course in Incident and Injury Free Indoctrination (IIFI), emergency procedures and Refinery-wide work practices specific to the Chevron Richmond Refinery. \n\nTraining is also given on process-specific hazards related to the area in which the contractor employee will be working. Contractors and all employees other than operators assigned to the specific process unit must sign in at the control room for the unit, review the emergency response plan for the area before entering the unit, and sign out when leaving.\n\n\n\nThe Maintenance & Health, Environmental & Safety Departments audit contractor companies periodically.

The contract owner/CHESM administrator also monitors contractor performance (i.e., compliance with stationary source safe work practices, knowledge of types of work, and the hazards involved). Documentation of the audits and on-site evaluations is maintained for a minimum of five years within the CHESM database.\n\n\n\nIt is also critical for contractors and Refinery personnel to be aware of any unique hazards that may occur prior to performing their work. A Joint Job Safety Visit is performed prior to the commencement of work. Additionally, communication of hazards when changes take places is accomplished via the \"Management of Change\", \"Lock-out / Tag-out\", and/or the \"Control of Entry into Process Areas\" processes; whichever is most appropriate. \n\n\n\n\n\nD. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nSection 2750.9 of the Cal/ARP regulation requires facilities to compile a five-year history of accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\nCommunicating the five-year accident history to the public informs the community of the factors causing or contributing to accidental releases, the onsite and offsite impacts of accidental releases, and the procedural and technological changes implemented to minimize the possibility of recurrence. The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against recurrence.\n\n\n\nThere is one incident in the last five years that meets the above criteria. A fire in the 4 Crude Unit on August 6, 2012 initiated a CWS Level 3 alert.  A shelter-in-place order was issued for Richmond, "

According to the Contra Costa County Health Services (CCHS) approximately 15,000 people sought medical attention at local emergency rooms, and approximately 20 individuals were admitted to the hospital. Most reported cases involved minor complaints of nose, throat or eye irritation or respiratory issues. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., however, has been unable to confirm the accuracy of these estimates and is not in a position to determine whether the release caused any conditions for which people sought medical attention.  Six employees received first aid onsite by the Chevron Fire Department and/or the onsite clinic. Changes made to prevent recurrence are described in the Five Year Accident History Narrative Addendum.\n\n\n\nE. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Refinery maintains an emergency response program designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. As part of the emergency response program:\n\n\n\n- There is a written ERP for responding to accidental chemical releases, including releases of regulated substances. The ERP is reviewed to ensure that it remains accurate and current. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties; \n\n- There are procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment;\n\n- The Refinery works closely with local emergency responders (primarily the Richmond Fire Department) in preparing for emergencies; and\n\n- There are procedures for notifying the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery emergency response program is discussed in more detail in the following subsections.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe ERP addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a"

Hard copies of the ERP, and manuals of emergency plans and procedures, are also maintained throughout the Refinery. \n\n\n\nThe ERP is reviewed annually by the Manager of the Refinery Fire Department and updated to ensure that it remains accurate and current. Every employee receives training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.\n\n\n\nThe ERP includes the chemical-specific emergency response procedures for releases of RMP-regulated chemicals. The chemical-specific emergency response plans identify the characteristics of the chemical, emergency response and first aid procedures, and the community notification system. These plans also identify concentrations of chemicals that would trigger specific types of emergency response and when to notify the public.\n\n\n\nIn addition, all employees are trained on the ERP upon initial assignment. The level of emergency response training corresponds to the emergency response duties of the employee. Refresher training is provided annually or as required by appropriate members of management or trainers for thoroughness and accuracy.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the ERP, the Refinery also has local EAPs, which are posted in all buildings and operating area control rooms. All employees or contractors entering a process area must review the EAP for that area prior to entry. The EAP summarizes the first actions that are to be taken in the event of an emergency (e.g., stay clear of area, call emergency number, move indoors, etc.) and the means for reporting fires and emergencies (a single three digit phone number). The EAP also has guidelines for sheltering-in-place, evacuations, and earthquakes, as well as maps with evacuation routes and meeting places.\n\n\n\nEmergency Operating Procedures, which are a part of the prevention program, are another critical com"

Examples include H2S scrubbers, emergency deluge systems and administrative controls to manage ammonia and LPG inventory.\n\n\n\nRefinery Fire Department\n\nThe Refinery Fire Department responsibilities include inspections of fire-related equipment, permit authorization for hot work and confined space entry, security, and a variety of other tasks related to fire prevention and emergency response. Other members of the Refinery Fire Department are volunteers consisting of employees from the Operations, Maintenance, and Technical Divisions. Each volunteer member receives approximately 100 hours of training each year. \n\n\n\nUnlike other refiners in the area who have separate teams to deal with different types of emergencies, the Refinery Fire Department trains its personnel to handle any emergency that might occur. These emergencies involve all aspects of firefighting, including fires in process plants, building fires, storage tank fires, wild land fires, or fires related to transportation modes, including ships, barges, tank cars, and rail cars. Refinery Fire Department personnel are trained in confined space, high angle, and heavy rescue procedures. In addition, all of the full-time members are certified Hazardous Material Technicians, and are qualified to deal with any hazardous material incident including any oil spills at the ship and barge loading facilities. The Refinery Fire Department also responds to medical emergencies; many members are California State Certified Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). \n\n\n\nA variety of emergency response equipment exists at the Refinery and includes 25 emergency respons"

All of this equipment is maintained, inspected, and tested as outlined in the Refinery Fire Department Procedures and Policies.\n\n\n\nCoordination\n\nThe Refinery conducts emergency drills in which an offsite responding agency (Richmond Fire Department and/or CCHMP), the Refinery Fire Department, and non-responding employees work together to resolve the given scenario. This pre-planning activity ensures that the members of the responding agencies are familiar with the Refinery, the hazards of the regulated substances, the resources available at the Refinery, and the locations of these resources. It also clearly identifies the capabilities and limitations of each responding agency. These drills are conducted at least once a year.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery also works closely with the CCHMP for any necessary response to hazardous material releases (such as downwind air monitoring) and to alert the public in case of accidental releases, fires, or explosions in accordance with CCHMP's Emergency Response Area Plan. The Refinery worked with CCHMP to establish the CWS and the TENS zones, which provide incident notification to the community.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery Fire Department also provides mutual aid to the City of Richmond Fire Department and responds outside of the refinery within the City of Richmond whenever asked to do so by the city fire department. The Refinery Fire Department also belongs to an industrial mutual aid organization, Petrochemical Mutual Aid Organization (PMAO), and has responded to other oil companies and chemical plants during emergencies. Likewise, the emergency response resources of the other companies in PMAO are available for an emergency at the Refinery, if needed.\n\n\n\nNotification\n\nThe Emergency Response Program has plans and procedures in place for notifying employees, on-site and off-site emergency respo"

Alarms or sirens are used to notify personnel of an emergency situation, and appropriate actions (e.g., shelter-in-place) would be taken according to the EAP.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery has an internal Refinery-wide alarm system consisting of multiple sirens and loudspeakers to alert personnel to any incidents that may have impact on more than one area of the facility. In addition, there is a dedicated emergency intercom system to provide follow-up information during a widespread Refinery incident. Each operating area of the Refinery has a local alarm system for incidents within their operating units. Operators routinely carry in-plant two-way radios that are used for both normal and emergency communications.\n\n\n\nEmployees who do not respond to an emergency and contractors are trained in the Refinery EAP. Persons who are inside, or near, a building are instructed to shelter-in-place inside the building. Any individual who is not in, or near, a building are instructed to proceed via a safe route to a designated assembly site. There are designated assembly sites for both local area emergencies and for a Refinery-wide emergency.
