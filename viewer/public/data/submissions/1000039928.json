      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n1.\tFacility Accidental Release Policy\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Bear River Supply, Inc., Rio Oso Facility (herein referred to as BRSI or the Facility) at 218 Pleasant Grove Road, Rio Oso, California 95674 are committed to the prevention of an accidental release of aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Emergency Response/Contingency Plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\r\n2.\tFacility Information\r\n\u00bf\tThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\r\n\u00bf\tAqua ammonia is received by truck, stored in two 10,000 gallon aboveground storage tanks, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled at the site is 154,000 pounds.\r\n3.        The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is a release of 77,000 pounds of aqua ammonia, the volume of the largest storage tank when full, in to the secondary containment berm.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a pipe break within the secondary containment berm, modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.\r\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\r\nSafety Information:  BRSI ensures that information concerning the covered process and regulated substance is up-to-date and available for review by employees.  The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered process took place on January 10, 2014."

      "SummaryText": "Hazard Review:  A hazard review of the regulated processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on March 13, 2014.  Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\r\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The operating procedures were last revised on March 27, 2014.\r\nTraining:  The BRSI staff, as well as the Butte County Rice Growers Association (BUCRA) corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.  The training program was last reviewed on March 13, 2014.  The current training program is comprised of the following:\r\n\u00bf\tInitial employee training;\r\n\u00bf\tPeriodic refresher training;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\r\n\u00bf\tCompetency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\r\n\u00bf\tTraining records for each employee.\r\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspections were conducted on March 10, 2014 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted on March 13, 2014.\r\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years.  Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings."
