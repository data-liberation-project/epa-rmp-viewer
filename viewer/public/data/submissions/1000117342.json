The owners, management, and employees of Dixon Wholesale, part of Grow West (herein referred to as Dixon Facility or Facility) at 7235 Tremont Road, Dixon, California 95620 are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia. \n\nGrow West has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations to address process and operational safety. If an accidental release were to occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate the release and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment. A detailed Emergency Response Program (ERP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release. \n\n\nES\u00962.0\tFACILITY INFORMATION\nThe Dixon Wholesale Facility provides fertilizers and related products to farmers and other agricultural supply operations. The Facility\u0092s primary activity is the sale of liquid fertilizers (including anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and 10-34-0), granular fertilizers (prill), and a variety of non bulk, pre packaged chemicals (e.g., herbicides and pesticides) to farmers in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. Applicable NAICS codes for this facility include 42491 (Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers) and 325311 (Nitrogenous Fertilizer Manufacturing). The Dixon Wholesale Facility is not collocated within one mile from another regulated facility and has not had a reportable accident within the last five years. No practicability assessment for \u0093inherently safer technology or design\u0094 (IST/ISD) is required. The Dixon Facility has bee"

The operating procedures for the aqua ammonia and the regulated pesticide are reviewed, revised, and recertified in accordance with regulatory requirements. \n\n--- Training.  \nFacility staff and Grow West corporate staff understand that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program. The current training program is comprised of the following:\n1.  Initial employee training.\n2.  Periodic refresher training.\n3.  Training provided for new equipment additions or modifications.\n4.  Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\n5.  Training records for each employee.\n\n--- Mechanical Integrity (PL3) And Maintenance (PL2).  \nDixon Wholesale has implemented a Mechanical Integrity / Maintenance program for its regulated substances. The program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The program includes equipment inspection, preventive maintenance, recordkeeping, and training and is conducted in accordance with manufacturer\u0092s requirements, and industry practices (e.g., Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices, RAGAGEP). \n\n--- Management Of Change (PL3).  \nOperational, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the safety and integrity of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The Facility Management of Change (MOC) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures.\n\n--- Pre-Startup Safety Review (PL3).  \nThe pre-startup safety review (PSSR) applies to additions or modifications"

Implementing safety improvements is an on-going process at the Facility. Periodic evaluations will be performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. Specific changes to the anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and regulated pesticide processes at the Facility will be implemented as needed.\n\n\nES\u00967.0\tTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nGrow West, Dixon Wholesale conducted offsite consequence analyses (OCA) for the three processes at the facility. The OCAs evaluated the Worst-Case Release Scenario (as defined in regulation) and an Alternative Release Scenario (i.e., the more likely condition). \n\n--- Anhydrous Ammonia.  \nThe worst-case release scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount. That tank holds a maximum of 131,286 pounds (25,542 gallons) of anhydrous ammonia. The distance to toxic endpoint is 2.61 miles. The alternative release scenario, identified by Grow West during the process hazards analysis (PHA), is a release from a 2 inch pipe which lasts 2 minutes. That release would have a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.18 miles. \n\n--- Aqua Ammonia.  \nThe worst-case release scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to 25,000 gallons. The 190,000 pound release of aqua ammonia solution (equivalent to 46,250 pounds of NH3) to the secondary containment would have a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.51 miles. The alternative release scenario is a release from a hose that is collected in secondary containment (assumed as 10,000 pounds of solution, or 1,315 gallons). That release would have a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.19 miles."
