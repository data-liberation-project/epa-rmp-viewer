Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nThe Plains LPG Services L.P., Lone Star Fractionation & Isomerization facility is committed to conducting their operation in a safe and responsible manner.  They will conduct operations in compliance with applicable industry standards, OSHAA?s Process Safety Management Standard and EPAA?a Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. Their personnel will be trained and prepared to respond to operational emergencies safely and effectively, minimizing the risk to personnel, the public, and the community-at-large. They will ensure that their emergency response plans and capabilities are compatible with the local emergency response agencies.\n   \n2. The facility and regulated substances handled:\nThe facility is approximately 40 acres in size and is located approximately 10 miles northwest of Bakersfield, California and 7 miles south of Shafter, California. In 2007 the facility chaged ownership from Andrews Petroleum to Plains LPG Services, L.P.  It continues to be operated by former Lone Star personnel with technical support from Plains All-American Pipeline Corporate staff.  The plant processes liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) into a mixture of normal butane, propane, natural gasoline, and isobutane. The specific regulated substances handled by the facility are: methane, butane, isobutane, propane, and pentane.  \n\nThe butamer unit converts normal butane into isobutane using a platinum catalyst.  The resulting butane/isobutane mix is then sent to the deisobutanizer unit for separation.  The isobutane is separated from the mixture and sent to storage as a final product for sale as a feedstock.  The normal butane is returned to the process for recycling.  All units are interconnected and considered to be a single LPG processing plant.\n\nThe hydrogen unit produces hydrogen that is used in the butamer reaction.  Steam and natural gas are reacted together to produce hydrogen and other byproducts.  The hydrogen is then p"

Accidental release prevention program:\nThe facilities accidental release prevention program is modeled after and in compliance with federal and state programs for managing hazardous chemical processes.    It meets the requirements of OSHAA? Process Safety Management standard, EPAA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, and the state Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).\n\nSpecific elements of the program include: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Safety, Contractor and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\nSpecific accident prevention steps include the following programs, procedures, and practices:\no  Hot Work Permit procedure\no  Confined Space Entry procedure\no  Lockout/Tagout Procedure\no  Code of Safe Work Practices\no  Respiratory Protection Program\no  Hazwoper program/ Hazcom program\no  Procedure for opening process equipment and piping\no  Controlled/limited access to facility and process areas.\no  Integrity testing and inspection of process equipment/piping\no  Employee participation in the MOC process and PHA.\no  Unrestricted access to process safety information by employees and contractors.\no  Operator training program which includes initial, OJT, and refresher training and demonstration of competency.\no  Periodic training on selecte"

The five-year accident history:\nThe Lone Star Fractionation & Isomerization facility had no reportable accidents over the last five years (June 2004 to June 2009)that resulted in an injury, environmental damage, or off-site impact. \n\n5. The emergency response program:\nThe emergency response program is written and posted in a dedicated binder which is located in the control room, safety office and the training room.  The plan describes the evacuation procedures, the emergency actions to take, individual responsibilities during an emergency, and the appropriate notifications and contacts to make for specific types of emergency events.  Plant evacuations are initiated by activating an audible signal (horn).  The signal can be activated from an outside alarm station or from the main office.   The plan is reviewed and coordinated with the Kern County Fire Department on a periodic basis.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response team made up of operating/maintenance personnel and a team coordinator (Safety and Environmental Supervisor).  Team members receive annual training on their assigned responsibilities in the ERP and the appropriate levels hazardous waste and emergency response operations (29 CFR 1910.120 A?HAZWOPERA?).
