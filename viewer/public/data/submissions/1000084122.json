The facilities began operation in 1952 and has operated safely within the community for over 60 years.\r\n\r\nWe manufacture Hydrogen Cyanide, a basic building block chemical for the manufacture of acrylics products (manufactured by another company) and Solid Cyanides, also produced on our site for use in the mining and metallurgical industries.  We also produce a family of Aminonitrile Intermediates used to make reaction initiators.  \r\n\r\nThe Chemours Memphis Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities.\r\n\r\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nOur policy is that all accidental releases to the environment can be prevented.   Therefore, our goal is to not have a release that negatively impacts the public, environment, or plant personnel.  We work closely with local off-site emergency responders to ensure that in the unlikely event a spill or release goes beyond our fence line, we are all prepared to respond.\r\n\r\n2. REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nOf the materials we handle, the following chemicals meet the Risk Management Plan threshold for assessment and reporting.   EPA has identified these materials as having potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics:\tAmmonia (NH3)\r\n \tHydrocyanic Acid (HCN)\r\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2)\r\n\r\nFlammables:\tHydrogen\r\n \r\n\r\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nAt Chemours we take safety, health, and the environment very seriously.  We have designed several levels of safety into our operations and practices so that multiple failures must happen f"

Since each one of our layers of defense is very reliable, the probability of a release that spreads beyond our plant boundary is very small.  \r\n\r\nListed below are some examples of the things we do to prevent releases and reduce the impact of releases that do occur: \r\n\r\n(a) Plant equipment is designed carefully, to minimize the probability of a major leak or spill.\r\n\r\n(b) All unusual operations, and small leaks or spills are investigated to prevent recurrence.\r\n\r\n(c) Safety controls such as instrumentation, warning alarms, monitoring equipment, and automatic shutdown systems are installed.\r\n\r\n(d)Thorough routine audits of the process are conducted.\r\n\r\n(e) Regular equipment inspections and maintenance insure proper operations.\r\n\r\n(f) Training and testing of operators and mechanics ensures they follow safe operating procedures.\r\n\r\n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nUnder the RMP, EPA requires owners or operators to report all accidental releases that resulted in death, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, or property or environmental damage.  For the Chemours Memphis Site, there has been one incident involving exposures to regulated material that met the five-year accident history reporting criteria.\r\n\r\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Chemours Memphis Site has developed a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan that helps us protect the health of the public and our employees and prevent harm to the environment.   The plan establishes the emergency response organization, the training and preparation requirements, the equipment and facilities used for response, and procedures utilized during response.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe overall site Emergency Action Plan begins with a brief description of the purpose and primary objectives for the plan.   This includes: \r\n\r\n(a) Prevent injuries - both on and off-plant\r\n\r\n(b) Minimize property damage\r\n\r\n(c) Minimize interruptions to the continu"

The person providing first aid is also responsible to take whatever action is necessary for prompt transportation of injured or ill personnel to the nearest hospital.  Site Safety, Health, and Environmental Standards for Off-Plant Medical Treatment and Incident Classification, Investigation and Reporting are the written documents that describe these procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoordination with Community Emergency Response Organizations:\r\n\r\nOur site has reviewed and coordinated our Emergency Response Plan with local agencies and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.   Members of local fire department(s) and emergency response services have been to our site and participated in joint training with our emergency response employees.\r\n\r\n6.
