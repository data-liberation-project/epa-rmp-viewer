The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is summarized in the Emergency Planning and Response section of Costco Wholesale's PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nCostco maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nCostco Wholesale has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, West Palm Beach Fire Rescue.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Wholesale to evacuate the employees and to allow the responders to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nCostco Wholesale utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling for cross dock operations, cold storage, freezers, and also for air cooling in the Engine Room.  The ammonia system at the Costco Wholesale consists primarily of vessels, compressors, a condenser, evaporators and associated piping.  The majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility provides cold storage space and a cross dockin"

Ammonia sensors are located in the Engine Room and Wholesale that alert facility personnel and activate the ventilation system in the engine room and close all feed lines out of the engine room.  The ammonia detection system also has the capability to shut-off all electrical power to the engine room.  \n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 25,000 pounds.  \n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for several areas (Cross Dock (40 F), Meat Cooler (28 F), and the Engine Room (40 F)).  (Note: The Freezer Evaporators are currently not in service.)  The majority of the system equipment is located in the ammonia Engine Room.  The condensers are mounted on the Engine Room roof, the water diffusion tank is located outside the engine room, and the evaporators are placed in the cold storage areas with 1 unit in the ammonia engine room for temperature control. \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  The facility also maintains a contract with a professional refrigeration service firm to conduct preventative maintenance and any necessary repairs.\n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine room and the Wholesale.  In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the computer system.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, eva"

      "SummaryText": "porator fans shut-down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibility of any ammonia releases. \n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief system.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves, via an emergency refrigerant control box, to an outside water diffusion tank until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted during daily walk-throughs by Costco Wholesale, and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\" is used as a general guide.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince the initial startup of the facility in November 2003, there has been one release of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  As a result of a hurricane, the refrigeration system lost its entire ammonia charge. Section 6 of this RMP Report was not completed since the release does not meet EPA's definition of a \"reportable\" accident.  There were no onsite or offsite deaths, injuries, or property damage resulting from the release.  Also, the release did not cause any offsite environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.

In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the Department of Public Safety Emergency Management Services.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, calls will be made to the following organizations:  the National Response Center and within 15 minutes, the Florida Emergency Spill Reporting (State Warning Point).\n\nCostco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to renovation of the facility.\n\nCostco Wholesale will be responsible for evacuating and ensuring the safety of its employees and will coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department and its refrigeration contractor on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCostco Wholesale has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  A Compliance Audit was complete on August 23, 2006, and the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), initially conducted on July 9, 2002 and August 14, 2003, was revalidated on August 14, 2008.
