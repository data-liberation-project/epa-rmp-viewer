BIC's environmental staff, along with facility staff, administer several programs which contribute to release prevention including safe work practices, employee training, preventative maintenance and administrative controls designed to ensure that safety issues are identified and addressed.\r\n\r\n4) Prevention Program\r\nPrevention of accidental releases at the facility is accomplished through compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention provisions, federal and state regulations, and the application of long-standing corporate philosophies and initiatives which help support safe operations.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n-BIC's extensive in-line quality testing of every lighter not only guarantees safe and reliable operation of the product by the consumer, but also provides an additional measure of safety for warehousing operations.\r\n-Weekly inspections of hazardous waste storage areas, monthly fire extinguisher inspections, weekly sprinkler control valve and PIV inspection, fork truck driver training, impact alarms, and incident investigation.\r\n-Supervisors make weekly behavioral safety observations. \r\n\r\n5) Five-Year Accident History\r\nSince BIC began operations at this facility in January 2003, there have been no accidental releases of isobutane with off-site consequences.  \r\n\t\t\r\n6) Emergency Response Program\r\nBIC has implemented a written Emergency Action and Contingency Plan, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38.  This plan establishes detailed facility evacuation, response, and reporting procedures for potential emergencies including fires, explosions, accidental releases, power failures, natural disasters, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and medical emergencies.  The plan designates a Facility Emergency Coordinator who is responsible for implementing the plan during an"

      "SummaryText": "emergency.  The plan also provides for emergency training of all facility personnel.  The procedures in this plan have been coordinated with local emergency response agencies, including the Charlotte Mecklenburg County Emergency Management Division and the local fire department through the submittal of the plan and/or through facility site visits by agency representatives. \r\n\r\nEmergency response steps that may be implemented in the event of a release of isobutane may include use of portable fire extinguishers, evacuation of the facility and/or response by the local fire department.  Fire protection of the facility is provided by an automatic sprinkler system incorporating Early Suppression-Fast Response (ESFR) heads.  Packaged lighters are classified as a cartoned, expanded plastic commodity since the quantity of plastic and packaging used results in combustion characteristics similar to plastic materials.  Therefore, standard fire protection and response measures should provide adequate emergency response.  \r\n\r\n7) Safety Improvements\r\nBIC's environmental staff will continue to administer several programs which contribute to release prevention including safe work practices, employee training, preventative maintenance and administrative controls designed to ensure that safety issues are identified and addressed."

(BIC) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\n2) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nBIC, located at 5910-D Long Creek Park Drive in Charlotte, NC, is a warehouse and packaging facility for BIC Products.  BIC's Charlotte Packaging Facility consists of an office, warehouse, and packaging operations located in a single building.  At this facility, BIC handles several types of lighters, all of which contain isobutane.  Isobutane is a regulated substance under the Risk Management Program (RMP) with about the same flammability as propane. The facility is regulated under Program 1 requirements under the applicability criteria of \u00a768.10.\r\n\r\nPallets of lighters (packaged together into cases) are received at the facility by truck/trailer and unloaded via forklift. The number of lighters in each individual case depends on the type of lighter. The pallets are placed in rack or row storage. As orders for lighters are received, the pallets of lighters are transferred to the packaging area of the facility via forklift. Lighters are packaged per customer requirements, then shipped to BIC's distribution center located across the street.  \r\n\r\n3) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of BIC's Environmental, Health, and Safety policy.  BIC's corporate commitment to safety and sound environmental management is translated into ac"
