No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n \nThe alternative case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the overfilling of a formaldehyde storage tank and the spillage of 1,000 gallons (4,800 lbs of pure formaldehyde) of solution into the concrete diked area.  Modeling this scenario indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 0.2 mile.  The U.S. Census indicates that 20 people live within this distance from the storage tank; several public receptors are also located within this distance, including the adjacent Georgia-Pacific Corporation Particleboard Plant, and nearby residences.  No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n \n 1.3.2 Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n \nThere are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.  Propane is stored on-site in a 1,000 gallon (4,400 pound) storage tank, however, this quantity is less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n \n 1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n \n Since 19xx, the Vienna Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements:\n \n Program 3-essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n \n Program 2-requires simplified versions of 7 of the 12 elements of the Program 3 prevention program (not applicable for Vienna Plant)\n \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Vienna Plant's Program 3 prevention program"

These documents are used to (l) train employees, (2) perform process hazards analyses, (3) evaluate process changes, and (4) help maintain the equipment.\n \n 1.4.1.2 Process Hazard Analysis\n \n The Vienna Plant performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.

An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Vienna Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n \nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).

      "SummaryText": "1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \n Georgia-Pacific Resins, Inc. (GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Vienna, GA.  The facility is located on 7th Street and is adjacent to another Georgia-Pacific Corporation plant which manufactures particleboard.  The resin facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1970 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins.  This formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1971.  Overall, the facility employs 54 full-time employees.\n \n GPRI is committed to operating the Vienna, Georgia plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Vienna Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Vienna Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Vienna Plant.\n \n The risk management program at the Vienna Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more t"

In fact, the Vienna Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\nGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Vienna Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered.

These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Vienna Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n \nIn the event of an accidental release, the Vienna Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.
