Caratan, Inc. recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n     The M. Caratan, Inc. PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and  integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The M. Caratan Inc. PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the fileing date has passed.\n\n     M. Caratan, Inc. believes that Employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Refrigeration Operator, has been deeplly involved in all aspects of the development and implementation of the M. Caratan, Inc. PSM/RMP program he has voluntarily assumed major responsibility for operating the M. Caratan, Inc. facility safely.\n\n     The M. Caratan, Inc. Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Delano Fire Department.  All M. Caratan, Inc. employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     M. Caratan, Inc. grows, processes, stores and ships table grapes to a wide market area.\n     The refrigeration system contains no more than 65,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. \n      Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in quantities above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     The WORST CASE release scenario involves the complete rupture of A  High Pressure Receiver.\n     A maximum release of 65000  Pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute per"
