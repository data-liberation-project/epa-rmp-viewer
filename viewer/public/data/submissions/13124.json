Caratan, Inc. recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n     The M. Caratan, Inc. PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and  integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The M. Caratan Inc. PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the fileing date has passed.\n\n     M. Caratan, Inc. believes that Employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Refrigeration Operator, has been deeplly involved in all aspects of the development and implementation of the M. Caratan, Inc. PSM/RMP program he has voluntarily assumed major responsibility for operating the M. Caratan, Inc. facility safely.\n\n     The M. Caratan, Inc. Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Delano Fire Department.  All M. Caratan, Inc. employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     M. Caratan, Inc. grows, processes, stores and ships table grapes to a wide market area.\n     The refrigeration system contains no more than 65,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. \n      Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in quantities above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     The WORST CASE release scenario involves the complete rupture of A  High Pressure Receiver.\n     A maximum release of 65000  Pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute per"

Caratan, Inc. conducts an annual training and response exercise with the Delano  Fire Department to practice, train and update the Emergency Response Program\n\n     M. Caratan, Inc. conducts an annual PSM/RMP implementation progress audit of the entire PSM/RMP program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements. M. Caratan, Inc. considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be \"living\" documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\n    M.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n     Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia releases.  The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Fire Department.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      M. Caratan recognizes that even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent, their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" becomes \"second nature\".\n\n     M.
