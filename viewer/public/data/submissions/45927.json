ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWe at Pactiv Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Yakima Valley Office of Emergency Management and the Yakima City Fire Department to provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass the manufacturing of polystyrene foam plastic consumer and building products such as meat trays and insulation construction material. We have one regulated substance present at our facility, butane.  This regulated substance is used as a blowing agent at our facility. \n\nThe maximum inventory of butane at our facility is 75,000 lbs.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario, we have used equations from Appendix D of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA's) Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the equations provided by the EPA in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Offsite Consequence"

      "SummaryText": " Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted is for a Level 3 flammable substance which involves a catastrophic release from product storage tank.  The scenario involves the release of 91,000 lbs. of butane.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes have not been considered when evaluating this worst case scenario.  For this scenario, it is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under the worst case weather conditions, the consequence distance from the explosion of the vapor cloud to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) is 0.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted is for a Level 3 flammable substance which involves a release of butane from the product storage tank or process delivery line.  The scenario involves the release of 78,000 lb. of butane which is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion.  Passive mitigation controls were not taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include a deluge system.  The maximum distance from the center of the vapor cloud to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) is 0.2 miles.\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, we have one process at our facility which is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration  (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and we have an air operating permit ID y-001 from the Yakima Regional Clean Air Authority.  This facility plans to submit an application within two years to receive a Star ranking under OSHA's Voluntary Protectio"
