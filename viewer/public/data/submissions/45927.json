ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWe at Pactiv Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Yakima Valley Office of Emergency Management and the Yakima City Fire Department to provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass the manufacturing of polystyrene foam plastic consumer and building products such as meat trays and insulation construction material. We have one regulated substance present at our facility, butane.  This regulated substance is used as a blowing agent at our facility. \n\nThe maximum inventory of butane at our facility is 75,000 lbs.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario, we have used equations from Appendix D of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA's) Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the equations provided by the EPA in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Offsite Consequence"

      "SummaryText": "Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted is for a Level 3 flammable substance which involves a catastrophic release from product storage tank.  The scenario involves the release of 91,000 lbs. of butane.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes have not been considered when evaluating this worst case scenario.  For this scenario, it is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under the worst case weather conditions, the consequence distance from the explosion of the vapor cloud to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) is 0.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted is for a Level 3 flammable substance which involves a release of butane from the product storage tank or process delivery line.  The scenario involves the release of 78,000 lb. of butane which is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion.  Passive mitigation controls were not taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include a deluge system.  The maximum distance from the center of the vapor cloud to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) is 0.2 miles.\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, we have one process at our facility which is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration  (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and we have an air operating permit ID y-001 from the Yakima Regional Clean Air Authority.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at Pactiv Corporation \u00bf Yakima, WA:  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nPactiv maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nPactiv conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  HAZOP methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years and when major changes are made to the covered process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Pactiv maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and emergency operations.  The information is reviewed on a regular basis and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nPactiv has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating components of the covered process are competent in the operating procedures associated with these components.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPactiv performs documented maintenance checks on covered process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes but is not limited to storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.

Operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the covered process conditions are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to additions and modifications to the covered process are conducted as a regular practice at Pactiv.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPactiv will continue to conduct periodic audits to ensure that the provisions set forth under the RMP and PSM rules are being implemented.   Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \n\nIncident Investigation\nPactiv promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions that would prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained at our facility for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPactiv truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and they actively participate in process safety management.  In addition, Pactiv employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules,"
