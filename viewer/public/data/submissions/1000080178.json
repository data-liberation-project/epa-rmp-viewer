Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n4. 5-Year Accident History:\r\nThis facility has not had any accidental releases from covered processes that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage during the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Plan:\r\nMichigan Dairy has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The emergency action plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances. The emergency action plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release. The emergency action plan includes information on emergency health care. Michigan Dairy works closely with the Livonia City Fire Department for response to emergency situations including releases of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. We will continue our annual facility evacuation drills and planning/training site visits with Livonia City Fire Department in the future."
