The facility is fully fenced and monitored 24 hours a day by a security force.  Various products have been manufactured on the site since 1921.  Currently, the site consists of two manufacturing businesses:\r\n\r\no Tedlar(R); polyvinyl fluoride films\r\no Corian(R); sheet building materials\r\n\r\nThe only EPA RMP listed substance at Yerkes is VINYL FLUORIDE (VF), a flammable.  VF is located in the Tedlar &reg; unit.  \r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nFollowing are brief summaries of the Worst and Alternate case scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario: Vinyl Fluoride, Regulated Flammable Chemical\r\nThe worst-case release scenario following RMP regulation guidelines is a Vinyl Fluoride storage tank failure, with no mitigation assumed.  A release, if ignited, could result in a vapor cloud explosion that can have an off-site impact, but no impact on public receptors.   A release is unlikely to due proper equipment design and strict mechanical integrity evaluations. There is also a water deluge fire protection system and emergency venting to further protect against this scenario.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Vinyl Fluoride, Regulated Flammable Chemical\r\nThe alternate-case release scenario is the most likely hazardous event discussed in the 2016 cyclic Process Hazards Analysis 2016 VF Unloading and Storage.  This scenario would consist of a  1/4 inch hole in a portion of the process containing liquid VF, such"
