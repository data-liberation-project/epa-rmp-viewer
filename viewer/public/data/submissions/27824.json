      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nPROCESS SUMMARY\nReddy Ice Plant #321, the East Point, Georgia facility, manufactures ice for retail and wholesale distribution.  The facility maintains approximately 36,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for their ice manufacturing and storage.\n\nThe refrigeration operation consists of two standard design ammonia systems consisting of compressors, condensers, storage tanks, ice makers, and freezer vaults.  Each system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high temperature and pressure, low suction pressure, low oil pressure, high and low liquid level cutouts, and pressure safety relief valves on all applicable equipment.  Ammonia detectors and alarms are installed throughout the plant. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant.  The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent.  Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility?s program of proper training, knowledge of the equipment and procedures, and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment.\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process.  These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required.  Administrative controls are in place, which limit the amount of ammonia stored in vessels to approximately 25-35% of their intended capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained facility refrigeration personnel in the event of an ammonia release.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM 3\nBased on the Reddy Ice-East Point facility?s ammonia inventory, location, and requirement to meet OSHA PSM standards, the facility i"

      "SummaryText": "s subject to the Accident Prevention Program 3 requirements.  The Accident Prevention Program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility.  Packaged Ice, Inc. Corporate Management and Reddy Ice-East Point management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the general public, and the environment.  A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of EPA?s Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act.  The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for training, operating procedures, documentation, etc. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure development, implementation and integration of the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements.  The Plant Manager is identified as PSM/RM Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements.  The Engineering and Maintenance Supervisor has responsibility for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation.  A rotating safety committee is selected each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-East Point facility has conducted offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) relative to the potential accidental release of ammonia.  The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release.  A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program.\n\nThe worst-case scenario "

      "SummaryText": "consisted of a total release from the main ammonia recirculator vessel outside the building, as it would house the largest mass of ammonia at any given time.  Administrative controls limit the amount of ammonia in the vessel to 30% of its total capacity, or 11,000 pounds.  Based on this amount plus additional ammonia in the piping, 12,000 pounds could be released from the vessel during a 10-minute period, potentially affecting a modeled radius of 1.2 miles and a population of 13,500 persons.  This impact is extremely unlikely, as: 1) the vessel is on a raised, protected dock, and 2) the RMP*Comp program is very conservative, resulting in a large maximum radius. \n\nSeveral alternative scenarios, or potentially more likely scenarios, for the facility system were explored, ranging from a release from a valve seal, or a minor break in indoor piping, to failure of an outdoor liquid line.  The selected scenario consists of a liquid and vapor release from a cracked tube in an ice machine.  The RMP*Comp program calculates a 1,200 pound per minute release rate; however, the ice maker contains an approximate operating charge of only 800 pounds of ammonia.  Based on the 1,200 pound per minute release rate, a radius of 0.2 mile and a population of 260 persons is calculated.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-East Point facility has had two releases in the past five years that require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.  In May 2001, an 1,800-pound release occurred with no offsite impact.  In July 2002, a 10,000-pound release resulted in evacuation of some 150 persons from the plant and surrounding businesses.  Nine persons were given some medical treatment, but there were no serious injuries.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-East Point facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying the public and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equ"

The ammonia has been reported, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC."
