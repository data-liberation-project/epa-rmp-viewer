(941)533-0551 ext. 430\n\nSubject:     \nOSHA 29 CFR part 1910.119\nEPA    40 CFR Part 68\n(Executive Summary)\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\n\n    This is to inform all interested persons that Orange-co of Florida, Inc.  has complied with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68,  to deal with the risks involved with the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n    \n     These programs have aided our facility in preventing the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as fires, explosions, and other types of major hazards. Orange-co.'s safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, and pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at this facility.\n\n\nListed on the following page are two examples that were considered to be \"worst case scenarios \" in Orange-co of Florida, Inc. Process Hazard Analysis. Listed below them are the reasons that they are unlikely to happen. This type of modeling would not have been possible without an experienced working knowledge and a clear understanding of all the components at this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCENARIO #1\n\n\nFailure of the high-pressure receiver containing 28,500 lbs. of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 80% of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten-minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.7 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  \n\nThis scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n \n7 Worst-case weather conditions are uncommo"

Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel .46 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. Transfer hose failure was chosen as the alternative release scenario because it is a temporary connection and constructed of materials other than steel. \n\nThis scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: \n\n7 Emergency equipment such as an excess flow valve on the tank truck and valves to isolate the transfer hose; \n7 The facility accident prevention program in place at the facility including operating procedures to have personnel present at all times during unloading,  \n7 The mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary;  \n7 The emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\nThere were three accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years; the largest release was over 100 pounds which occurred on 7/4/97. There were no injuries to employees or local citizens during any of these releases.\n\n\n\nOrange-co took a pro-active initiative in developing, implementing, and maintaining its Emergency Response Plan to ensure a fast and efficient resolve in the event of an ammonia release.
