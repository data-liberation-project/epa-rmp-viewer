      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Metcalf Energy Center, LLC\n\nThis document represents the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Metcalf Energy Center, LLC (MEC) located in San Jose, California. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\nMEC uses aqueous ammonia at a concentration of approximately 28% (by wt.) and stores 95,753 lbs. (26,811 lbs. ammonia in solution weight only) making the site subject to both the California Accidental Release Program (Cal-ARP) and the Federal RMP Program under 40 CFR 68. The site is not subject to either the OSHA or EPA Process Safety Management Regulations. The site has been determined to be a Program Level 2 facility.\n\nThe RMP addresses the Program 2 requirements of Cal-ARP as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the \"general duty clause\" of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP Program 2 requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n    ? identify hazards\n    ? design and maintain a safe facility\n    ? prevent releases\n    ? minimize the consequences of releases.\n\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the Cal-ARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented RMP, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. \n\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 5070.3, the following summary is given:\n\nThis RMP applies to the MEC facility located at:\n    1 Blanchard Rd.\n    San Jose, CA. 95013\n    UTM: N 4119623m, E 611409m\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\nThe Metcalf Energy Center (MEC) is a 600-megawatt (MW) (nominal output) natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant, with a 230-kilovolt (kV) switchyard feed into a PG&E switchyard and approximately 200 feet of 230-kV trans"

A transmission interconnection loops into the existing PG&E 230-kV Metcalf-Monta Vista No. 4 transmission line that passes near the northern boundary of the MEC site. Natural gas for the facility is delivered via approximately one mile of 16-inch pipeline that is connected to an existing PG&E transmission backbone pipeline that runs along the eastern side of U.S. 101. Recycled water for cooling is supplied by the South Bay Water Recycling Program (SBWR) and is delivered from a tap into SBWR's existing main pipeline in eastern San Jose via a new 20 inch, 7.3-mile pipeline. Industrial wastewater and sanitary sewer from the plant is transported from the plant via a 12 inch (maximum) forced main installed in the same trench as the recycled water pipeline and connected to San Jose's sewer system downstream of any system constraints. Process makeup water and domestic water is supplied from the city's municipal water system (San Jose MUNI) via a 1.25-mile pipeline or from onsite wells. This supply will also serve as a backup water supply for plant cooling. \n\nThe site is located just west of Monterey Road, between Metcalf Road to the north and Bailey Road to the south.\nSubstance Used/Stored:\tAqueous Ammonia 28% Solution (CAS# 7664-41-7)\n\t\t\t\t\nFacility SIC Code: 4911\tFacility NAICS Code: 221112\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency action policies at the facility are delineated in Sections 4.0 and 14.0 respectively.

Inspection and maintenance program for all system equipment.\n    ? Monitoring of employee and contractor use of the system.\n    ? Contractor Safety Program\n    ? Emergency Response Plan\n    ?

The program addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, spill response measures, evacuation plans and personnel accounting, notification of emergency response agencies and the public in the event of a release. In the event of an ammonia spill, Metcalf Energy Center may respond will limited defensive actions.\n\nThe emergency response program is coordinated annually with Santa Clara County and/or San Jose Fire Department.\n\nMetcalf Energy Center conducts annual Emergency Response training which may include drills with local emergency responders.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Elements\nChemical specific prevention measures are summarized as follows:\n    ? Periodic inspection of ammonia tank, containment area, pumps, piping network, flow controllers, and injection grid.\n    ? Monitoring of tank and system pressures and temperatures.\n    ? Monitoring of unloading/delivery procedures.\n    ? Installation and use of ammonia detector(s) in the main tank area.\n    ? Installation an"

Provide a chemical specific training program.\n    ? Access to the MEC facility site is controlled and fenced.\n\nThe piping and distribution network is equipped with several manual and automatic valves, which effectively limit the amount and duration of any accidental release. System pressures and flow rates will be monitored at the main plant control room console.  The underground liquid (aqueous ammonia) carrying piping is dual contained. Review of the P&IDs (Appendix B) indicates that there are numerous pressure, temperature, and level indicator sensors, which will be reported directly to the distributed control system (DCS) for operator confirmation and action.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPresently, Calpine is operating several similar power generation facilities in California. Operational and safety issues identified at any Calpine facility are analyzed for applicability to other operational sites.\n\nAdditionally, the following will be used to identify and track safety improvements at MEC.\n    ? Required periodic updating of the PHA per the Cal-ARP regulations\n    ? Implementation and revision to safety and training procedures\n    ? Required seismic \"walk-down\" inspection every 5 years, per the Cal-ARP regulations\n    ? Routine safety inspections\n\nThe facility will constantly strive for improved performance and reliability from all its processes. As specific process and safety improvements are identified, they will be evaluated for application and implementation.\n\nTraining\nA training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program. The training program is comprised of the following:\n    ? Initial employee training\n    ? Refresher training\n    ? Training provided because of a new equipment addition or modification \n    ?

Deficiency correction procedures and documentation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nAn essential element of the RMP program is the use of periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan. Compliance audits under the federal and state RMP regulations are conducted, at a minimum of once every three years. The periodic compliance audit addresses the following:\n    ? Implementation and comprehension of the current plan elements.\n    ? Are plan revisions required?\n    ? Does the plan adequately address all required RMP elements?\n    ? Effectiveness of the current plan.\n    ? Level of employee involvement.\n    ?

This notice should detail the time and place of the meeting and should request that interested parties RSVP to have an idea of the number of attendees.  This is to ensure that an appropriately sized venue is selected. Should no parties RSVP, then the meeting will still need to be held, but it could be held in a smaller venue.  Subsequent notices may need to be published to inform the public of any changes to the meeting details.  The meeting shall be accomplished through written meeting minutes that are signed by a responsible party for the company, attesting to their accuracy, or through an audio-visual recording of the meeting.  This documentation shall be saved in RMP files and maintained for five years."
