      "SummaryText": "Clean Harbors Aragonite is a permitted RCRA/TSCA Hazardous Waste Incinerator.  The site is located approximately 40 miles from the nearest residential neighbor, approximately 10 miles from the nearest industrial facility, and approximately 2.5 miles from the nearest railroad or major highway.\r\n\r\nThe facility accepts for disposal a variety of hazardous wastes by container, tanker truck, or rolloff truck.  Inbound receipts of waste materials for disposal fluctuate dramatically by volume and concentration.  Aragonite makes every effort to control inbound receipts to avoid exceeding RMP thresholds on-site.  All inbound materials are profiled in advance, physically inspected upon arrival, weighed upon arrival, and sampled upon arrival.  Sample analysis is used to determine handling methodology, confirm the materials match what was previously profiled, and to determine incineration feed rates.  Analysis is generally used only to confirm decision making for business or disposal purposes.  RMP constituents are generally not analyzed and the pre-shipment profiling is used to determine the concentration of RMP constituents that may be present at any time.  These are generally based upon generator knowledge and frequently are a worst-case determination.  It has been found that generators of waste frequently over-estimate concentration ranges when profiling their waste streams.\r\n\r\nAragonite facilities consist of fully permitted secondary containment areas for all waste materials in storage.  Materials are inspected, sampled and placed into storage until a determination as to the proper handling can be made for incineration.  All containment/storage areas are fully permitted for the materials placed into storage.  All ignitable storage areas contain appropriate fire protection equipment upto and including fire sprinklers.

Employees are routinely trained in excess of regulatory requirements to perform their duties.\r\n\r\nAragonite utilizes emergency communications equipment including handheld radios, cellular telephones, landline telephones and public address systems.  The facility is equipped with alarms, loudspeakers and sirens to alert visitors and employees of dangers.  The facility performs a quarterly evacuation drill of the site and coordinates emergency response activities with nearby industrial neighbors and local emergency coordinators.  Many site employees volunteer their time as EMT's, Firemen, and/or other emergency responders for local communities and counties.  The site is also equipped with two fire engines and one ambulance.  Employees are trained as first responders and EMTs for site emergencies.  The facility also provides support to the county in times when emergency response services are unavailable for roadside emergencies.  Site employees routinely assist the county in providing assistance to vehicle accidents along I-80.\r\n\r\nAdditional employee training includes that required by OSHA 1910.120, DOT training, confined space, waste identification and segregation, industrial hygiene, toxicology, respiratory protection, decontamination and emergency response.   Each employee receives specific training relevant to their duties.  Employees receive annual refresher training with a minimum of 8 hours classroom refresher per year.  All employees learn appropriate procedures for emergency response.  Spill response, fire response, medical first responders receive specialized training and frequent drills.  A site emergency contingency plan has been developed and is utilized to confirm all procedures are followed in a manner that will safeguard employees, the public and the environment.

      "SummaryText": "the training process through written tests, attendance sheets, job descriptions, training requirements, training history, on-the-job training, and files of training records are maintained.\r\n\r\nThe constituents identified with this RMP arrive in such a manner that it is difficult to control both the volume and the concentration that may be on-site at any one time.  Thus, predictive filing has become necessary.  The materials in question include butane lighters or aerosol cans confiscated by airport screeners that are identified with a large percentage of butane. Generally, the profiles assume the butane is 100% by weight which is extraordinarily high, but used for calculation purposes.  \r\n\r\nAlso included is diethylamine that are shipped primarily from sister facilities as blendable liquids with worst-case dimethylamine concentrations.  It is rare to see this constituent except in a mixture and generally the concentrations are far below that indicated on the profile.  Frequently, the material is not present at all, but continues to be reported on the corresponding profiles and thus triggers the RMP threshold.\r\nIn the 2019 RMP update, formaldehyde, propane and hydrogen fluoride (HF) were added.  Formaldehyde is stored in 25,000 gallon storage tank.  Propane is used to fuel facility equipment and stored under pressure in 30,000 gallon tank.  HF is stored in 300 gallon totes in the  drum warehouse.   \r\nAll RMP constituents are tracked individually by monitoring the weight of the container and the percentage concentration on a daily basis for all materials on-site and materials inbound that might place the facility above the threshold.  Tracking of individual containers to facilitate disposal before arrival of another shipment is maintained daily to prevent a trigger of the threshold.\r\n\r\nThis site is fully permitted by Utah Division of Solid and Hazardous Waste, U.S. EPA Region 8 RCRA, Utah Division of Air Quality, U.S. EPA Region 8 CERCLA, and U.S. EPA Region 8 TSCA.

All referenced agencies frequently visit the facility to monitor site procedures are within permitted parameters.  Aragonite must satisfy the referenced agencies as well as local agencies.\r\n\r\nThere is little risk posed by the constituents identified in this RMP primarily due to the nature of the materials being shipped to this facility.  The materials are placed into secure storage with appropriate fire protection, and appropriate spill control equipment.  Site employees respond to all site incidents and promptly clean up any spilled material.  Received waste streams are promptly rotated through the facility such that inventory is not allowed to accumulate such that thresholds are exceeded.  All containers are tracked individually both by location and by weight/quantity.  At any time, the facility can determine the exact location of all container in which RMP constituents might be present.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, all incidents are thoroughly investigated and reported.  All spills, injuries, fires or other incidents are used as training tools and reviewed by the site safety committee and VPP committee to prevent reoccurrence.  Procedures are developed and modified as necessary and appropriate engineering controls are identified and installed as site safety committees make recommendations.\r\n\r\nThis facility is deemed as having low risk for the reasons described above."
