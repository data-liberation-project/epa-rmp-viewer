The sensors are set at 0.5 parts per million (ppm) in the unit. On the truck loading rack the sensor is set at 0.5 ppm. The alarm has two warning lights and horns placed internally as well as externally. Our people are all 40 hour Hazwoper trained and go through an 8 hour refresher class once a year. Safety training is on-going in our plant. Our people are trained annually in proper use of SCBAs/Respirators as well as proficient in utilizing A/B/C Chlorine response kits. \n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency we utilize and on-site Hazardous Materials (Haz Mat) team comprised of Brenntag personnel that is capable of being the first responders at the unit. If the Haz Mat team is unable to handle the situation, outside contractors and LEPC personnel are immediately notified for assistance. This is fully outlined in our Emergency Response Plan for the Greens Bayou Facility.",

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nBrenntag produces chemicals which are used to clarify and purify the public waters of the Southwest.  As part of being a good neighbor to the community it serves with its chemicals, Brenntag has implemented a number of policies, procedures and systems to help ensure that the chemicals do not adversely affect the outside community.  The following serves as a brief overview of these policies, procedures, and systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrenntag Greens Bayou Facility is located on approximately 54 acres on Haden Road about 0.5 miles off of Interstate 10 just inside of Beltway 8 on the east side of Houston, TX. The Brenntag - Greens Bayou Chemical Complex employs 50 hourly plant personnel and 23 administrative employees at the site.  \n\n\n\nThe process areas in the facility are Texas Acidified Products, Bauxite, Texas Chlor Alkali, and Specialty Chemicals.  \n\n\n\nThe Texas Acidified Products area is the production area for aluminum sulfate (alum) loading and blending, HCL handling, and ACH/PAC manufacturing. It also handles blending of several water treatment products. It also handles loading and packaging of sulfuric acid products.\n\n\n\nThe Bauxite area is responsible for the manufacture of the base aluminum sulfate material utilized in the Alum/Aqualum area products. \n\n\n\nThe Texas Chlor Alkali area is the production area for sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and repackaging of chlorine from 90-ton rail cars to 2000-pound containers and 150 pound cylinders. It also handles loading and packaging of caustic and KOH products. \n\n\n\nBlending and repackaging of various chemical products is the activity that takes place at Specialty Chemicals.  \n\n\n\nOther facilities located on the property include an administrative building, truck terminal building, guardhouse, maintenance shop, laboratory, and change house.\n\n\n\nBrenntag is a MARSEC facility and complies with the site Facility Security Plan on file with the Coast Guard (DHS). Brenntag adheres to the TWIC card policy as set for by the"

      "SummaryText": " Department of Homeland Security and ensures proper site security 24 hours per day. All Brenntag employees must be TWIC certified and all visitors/contractors/vendors are subjected to vigorous standards for plant access.\n\n\n\nBrenntag repackages chlorine and utilizes it for Sodium Hypochlorite bleach manufacture at the Greens Bayou facility. The chlorine arrives on site via rail car and is off loaded at one rail spot. Brenntag maintains an inventory of full rail cars (10-15 depending on the season) but only utilizes one railcar (180,000 lbs) for manufacturing purposes at any given point. Sulfur Dioxide cylinders (150 lb.) are warehoused and distributed from the Greens Bayou facility. Brenntag maintains an inventory of no more than 100 cylinders at any given time. Brenntag does not manufacture Sulfur Dioxide.\n\n\n\nThe handling of chlorine in the Greens Bayou Facility gives the potential of effecting the outside community. This is the chemical which is the driving force behind the policies, procedures, and systems which govern the operation of the entire Brenntag facility.  Under OSHA 29CFR1910.119 (Process Safety Management) Brenntag developed a fourteen section manual that helps prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic release of chlorine.  Training is one of the most important sections of PSM.  Brenntag operators receive 40-hour Hazwoper training in addition to several \"hands on\" training topics throughout the calendar year.  This level of training allows us to respond to facility incidents which may occur.  This level of training coupled with an active involvement by all employees to identify needed change is invaluable to maintaining a safe and reliable facility. Other aspects of the PSM such as Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Compliance Audits, Pre-Start up Reviews, Process Hazard Analysis are all rigorously followed, reviewed, and updated to ensure optimum safety and compliance with PSM/RPM regulations.\n\n\n\nBrenntag Emer"

      "SummaryText": "gency Response Plan (ERP) is reviewed and update annually.  The ERP is divided into thirteen sections ranging from administration, policies, duties, chemical information, notifications, evacuations, drills and communications.  Drills are an important learning tool for operators and supervisors.  Brenntag conducts plant wide drills quarterly and also participates in drills, whenever staged, conducted for all the facilities located on Haden Road.  Other participants in the Haden Road drill include Office of Emergency Management, Sheriff's Department, and Cloverleaf Fire Department.\n\n\n\nCommunications is an important tool in an effective response or mitigation process.  At Brenntag, any level of chlorine above 0.5 ppm will shut the entire process down.  At this level a plant wide alarm sounds informing all operations of a chlorine release.  If a problem exists, operations personnel secure their process areas and proceed to the response team assembly area.\n\n\n\nBrenntag has continued to be vigilant in the area of accident prevention and accidental releases. There has been one incident at the facility on 12/21/17 where chlorine was released into the atmosphere due to human error.\n\n\n\nAs Brenntag continues to grow, we are continually looking for new and improved methods to ensure the safety of our personnel and our community.  These changes can only occur with continued input and support of our personnel, regulatory agencies, and our community. Brenntag will continue to focus on training, advances in technology (equipment upgrades), communication, and employee involvement to sustain improvement at the Greens Bayou facility.\n\n"
