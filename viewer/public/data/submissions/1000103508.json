We have also given local medical service providers information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt this time the facility has been in operation for 5 years.  All of the equipment is still fairly new. We will continue to review our operations as required by our current EH&S management systems and scrutinize our systems as we drive continual improvement through operational efficiency, process training and maintenance.  Since our last RMP submittal, we have more than doubled the number of PM activities related to Isocyanate release prevention.  We have also developed and implemented improvements in our RMP training, across the organization. \n\n\nIn addition, we will conduct quarterly \u201cSpill drills\u201d with the emergency response team to ensure our preparedness to react to a spill, mitigate the hazards and limit release quantities."

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nContractor Awareness\nHot Work Permitting\nMonthly Workplace Inspection by members of the JHS&E Team\nSafety Information\nHazard Reviews of our Processes\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nEquipment Maintenance Programs\nRMP Compliance Audits\nAccident/Incident Investigation\n\nIn addition, we have an established Isocyanate Control Program that outlines both the hazards of handling Toluene Diisocyanate and the controls that are in place to reduce those hazards.  Controls are in place to reduce exposure to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems are setup for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\n5. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Tanner, Alabama Foam Plant has no history of any uncontrolled releases or spills of TDI.  There are documented incidents on file for minor spills inside of the building including all history since the facility was built. Each was within the enclosed containment area.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Plan\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides essential planning and training to effectively protect workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations."

Excess flow valves function to stop the flow, and roughly 10% of the tanker capacity was released into our containment area.  The resulting liquid forms a puddle with a surface area of 306 square feet with a volume of 450 gallons which evaporates to form a toxic cloud that disperses downwind.     \nMax Average Sustained Release Rate: 0.0135 pounds/min.

The foam is made by high pressure mixing of chemicals as they are poured into a mold that is attached by carrier to a continuously moving line.  The mold then moves through a curing oven.  Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, vacuum or mechanically crushed, trimmed, and prepared for shipment to customers.\n\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's risk management program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is received at the plant by tanker truck, and is stored in 2 tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room.  The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system.\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  \n\nTo be conservative, the facility has calculated the maximum possible inventory of TDI which could be onsite in order to determine the maximum intended inventory.
