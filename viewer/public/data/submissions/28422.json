      "SummaryText": "The facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to seasonal startup.  These procedures identify potential sources of release and equpment corrections required to prevent these releases.  The equipment is reviewed by on-site personnel, mechanical engineers, and refrigeration contractors as required.  On site personnel provide initial emergency response.  On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off site release.   Emergency response for a major release event will be provided by local fire and police departments.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly and required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of (5 ) years.  Training and familiarity with the Company's Safety and Operating  Procedures and Emergency response plan are required by all persons responsible for Ammonia refrigeration maintenance and operations.   They will also be requird to become faimliar with this RMP.\n\nThe cooling facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in their produce and cold storage operations.  The Refrigeration equipment consists of three cold rooms with evaporators and high side refrigeration systems as a staionary source.\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios were evaluated using the methodologies recommended in the RMP off site Consequence Analysis Guidance as prepared by the EPA, for the Ammonia based refrigeration system.  The worst case release considers the complete release of the maximum charge in the system within a 10 minute period.  The maximum distance to the toxic end point was determined to be 1.6 miles.  For the Alternative Release scenario, the maximum extent of the release is 528 feet.  No mitigation measures were  considered for each"

      "SummaryText": " release.\n\nA thorough review of the refrigeration system including a Hazop and Operability Study (HazOp) was performed on Oct 30 , 2002.  Equipment corrections and updates were discussed for those items determined to have the highest potential for off-site releases.  Safety and equipment operational training will be conducted annually and will include safety procedures and  emergency response procedures.\n\nNo reportable releases or accidents relating to the release of ammonia have occured at the facility  in the last (5) years.\n\nThe facility has implemented the State and County mandated Acutely Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan or Business Response Plan.  This Plan outlines procedures for emergency ammonia release response as well as general facility response.\n\nSafety improvements have been identified during the preparation of this program.  These improvements have been documented and a schedule will be developed for their implementation.  Some of the improvements include change out of pressure relief valves every (5) years and operational procedures."
