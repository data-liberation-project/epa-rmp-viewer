              "Description": "This prevention program applies to the Hydrogen Fluoride manufacturing unit which includes the HF generation, high purity, aqueous HF and shipping subprocesses.  A PHA (Fault Tree) was conducted for the main HF and aqueous HF processes in 1989 and was revalidated (HAZOP)in 1995, 2000, and the 2005-2006 timeframe.  Management of change evaluations and prestartup safety reviews are conducted for all modifications. The ultra-high purity HF process was decommisioned in December of 2003.  The Boron Trifluoride trailer storage area was added in 2010.",

The plant's products are used to make refrigerants, fluorocarbons, high octane gasoline, pharmaceutical films, foam insulation, and other chemical derivatives.  \n\nSome of the materials stored and used by the facility are hydrogen fluoride, oleum, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, trifluorochloroethylene, 1, 1- difluoroethylene and other chemicals which are on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances.  The Honeywell Geismar Plant's storage and use of these substances exceeds the specified threshold quantities as defined by the EPA's RMP Rule.  \n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for the Honeywell  Geismar Plant: \n\n1) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \n\nIt is the policy of the Honeywell Geismar Plant to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, and environmental risks related to its operations;  by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.

Honeywell shares the site with three other chemical manufacturing facilities.  The area is predominately rural with adjacent and nearby chemical manufacturing facilities. There are no immediate residential neighbors.  The plant employs approximately 180 company and about 90 contract workers.\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Plant's five covered processes manufacture new generation ozone friendly refrigerants, inorganic acids and fluoropolymer resin. The Hydrogen Fluoride Plant manufactures hydrogen fluoride.  The Multiproducts Plant manufactures 1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134a), pentafluoroethane (HFC 125) and 1-chloro-1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124).  The Aclon Resin Plant manufactures fluoropolymer resin.  The 125 Plant manufactures opentafluroethane (HFC 125).  The 245fa Plant manufactures 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC 245fa).\n\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used as a raw material in the manufacture of refrigerants, fluorocarbons, gasoline, as well as other chemical derivatives.  Aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride are used in the manufacture of electronic components, circuit boards, steel, high-purity quartz, light bulbs televisions, and computer monitors.\n\nHFC 134a is used as a refrigerant in automotive applications.  HFC 125 is used as a refrigerant in residential air conditioners and comm"

These calendars provide residents instructions and recommendations in response to audible warnings. The system is tested weekly.\n\nIn addition to the audible warning system, community alert networks exist to alert near neighbors.  These computer-assisted systems are capable of automatically alerting residents, industries, businesses, and others in the covered area by telephone.\n\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  \n\nHoneywell pursues a philosophy of continuous improvement in all aspects of its operations.  Improvements are identified and implemented throughout the facility's planning and operating cycles.\n\nThe plant's systematic safety review program identifies action items that improve upon the existing safeguards at the Geismar site and further reduce the potential for accidental release. The process hazard analyses for the Geismar manufacturing processes are reviewed and revalidated every five years.  Continuous improvement of the plant's processes and systems provides the highest level of protection from chemical incidents.\n\nHydrogen Fluoride Plant\n\nA process hazard analysis of the Honeywell Geismar Site's Hydrogen Fluoride Manufacturing Plant was completed in late 1989.  Revalidation was completed in 1995, 2000, 2004 an"
