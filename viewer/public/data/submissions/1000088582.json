This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. EnLink's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Tiger Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Tiger Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable. The facility is a two-train non-fractionating NGL extraction plant that is designed to process natural gas. Train I processes 240 MMSCF/D and Train II processes 150 MMSCF/D for a total of 390 MMSCF/D. The facility consists of inlet separation and filtration, molecular sieve dehydration and regeneration, a cryogenic processing unit, condensate stabilization, amine gas treatment, residue compression, propane refrigeration system, hot oil system, thermal oxidizer system, flare system, and all associated utilities and auxilary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in six 500-barrel atmospheric tanks located within secondary containment area and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGL from the cryogenic units and natural gas from residue compression are sent offsite via pipeline without intermediate storage. The processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EP"

The facility contains two sources of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Flammable Mixture and Propane.\nEnLink, Tiger Plant, RMP Page 5\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\nThe processes at the Tiger Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of each regulated substance in the facility.\nSpecialized Safety Features\nThe Tiger Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\nRelease Detection\n1. Tanks are gauged\n2. Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n3. High/Low alarms and shutdowns\n4. Facility is staffed 24-hours a day, 7-days a week\nRelease Containment/Control\n1. Secondary containment around atmospheric tanks\n2. Process relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels from rupturing\n3. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n4. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n5. Hydrocarbon gas detection and fire eyes\n6. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\nRelease Mitigation\n1. Trained emergency response personnel\n2. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n3. SPCC Plan\n4. Fire extinguishers\nEnLink, Tiger Plant, RMP Page 6\nEmergency Response Program Information\nThe Tiger Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammabl"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\nThe overall emergency response program for the Tiger Plant is coordinated with the Reeves County LEPC. The Reeves County LEPC can be reached at (432) 447-3542. The Tiger Plant has around-the-clock communications capability. EnLink Midstream Partners operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Malaga Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. EnLink conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations and the Tiger Plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\nFive - Year Accident History\nTiger Plant has not had any accidents because it has not been completed as of the date of this RMP.
