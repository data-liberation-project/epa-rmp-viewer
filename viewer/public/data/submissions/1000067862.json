A Process Safety Management(PSM) program has been implemented at the facility as outlined in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119.. Along with (PSM), the prevention program includes continual computor monitoring of the closed loop system and daily maintenance checks and services including periodic reviews. The system will shut itself down in most cases if a leak occurs. We have mechanics who have been trained to operate and maintain the system. We have an agreement with the City of Hickory and the Caldwell County Emergency Management System to support us in case of fire or a Ammonia leak. Emergency operation plans are developed to guide us in case of a leak. The City of Hickory Fire Dept. has been through our facility and is familiar with our systems in place.",
