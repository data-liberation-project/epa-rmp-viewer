This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading process (Program Level 3) at this Facility which includes the storage of up to 5 butane railcars and provisions to transfer butane from railcar to transport truck using portable transloading units.\n\nTCA complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119). This Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading process is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions. Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\nTCA maintains an Emergency Action Plan and has been designated a non-responding facility. As such, in the event of an emergency involving the Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading process, it is the policy of the Facility to evacuate personnel and contact the Anderson Fire Department to request their assistance. Facility personnel have received emergency response training and all contractors and visitors are briefed on appropriate emergency actions prior to being permitted onsite.\n\nTCA has coordinated their Emergency Action Plan with the Anderson Fire Department. In addition, representatives from the Anderson Fire Department have been briefed on the process.\n\nThis is an RMP for a new facility and therefore, the Facility has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in-place.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, TCA looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. Additionally, TCA intends to coordinate response with t"
