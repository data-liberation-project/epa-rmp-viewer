If an emergency were to occur, it is Hellers Carbonic?s policy to notify the Galva Fire Department.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:  The Hellers Carbonic, Galva facility is a dry ice manufacturing facility consisting of an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system with a 15,600 pound charge.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered by tank truck.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:  The worst-case scenario is a release from the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system?s high pressure receiver.  According to the EPA?s RMPComp program, the distance to endpoint is 11,616 feet or 2.2 miles.  The worst-case release could impact sensitive populations located as close as 500 feet from the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  The Hellers Carbonic Galva facility complies with OSHA?s PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA?s RMP (40 CFR 68) regulations and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance relevant codes and standards.\n\nFive-year accident history:  The Hellers Carbonic Galva facility has not had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place within the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy to notify the City of Galva Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.
