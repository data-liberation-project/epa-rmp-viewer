      "SummaryText": "A. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nThe Campbell Soup Supply Company has a deep concern for the protection of the environment, since through our daily operations we know the importance of clean surroundings.  The company has always made an honest effort to preserve the natural environment and will continue to strive towards improving our efforts in all forms of pollution control; be it water, air, solids, or noise.  We are dedicated to making improvements where we know they will provide positive results.  The environment is a natural resource that should be used, but not abused.  Our experience indicates environmental benefits can only be achieved by actions that have been preceded by scientific thought and facts, trying to avoid emotionalism.\n\nCampbell Soup Supply Company's goal is to form a union with our environment that will benefit all of life.  We are dedicated to using the earth's resources efficiently both to avoid waste and limit pollution in all our food processing operations.  We will continue to pursue every reasonable means to preserve the environment for the present and future generations.\n\nAmmonia safety is a key item in the Plant Safety Plan.  Campbell Soup Supply Company takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Manager of the Maintenance & Power areas is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\nB.

      "SummaryText": "Supply Company's Maxton Plant produces canned food products for sale to the public.   The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide freezing and cooling for the food products produced.   Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Maxton Plant.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\no Employee Participation Program\no Process Safety Information\no Process Hazard Analysis\no Operating Procedures\no Training Program\no Contractor Safety Program\no Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\no Mechanical Integrity Program\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\no Management of Change Procedures\no Incident Investigation Procedures\no Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\nD.   Five-Year Accident History\n\nOne ammonia-related accident occurred at the Maxton Plant during the previous five years.   This accident resulted in a minor on-site injury to an employee who had an existing respiratory condition.  465 pounds of ammonia were released, but there were no offsite consequences associated with the accident.  \n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Maxton Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  \n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\no Emergency Response Organization\no Evacuation Plan\no Response Activities\n\nF.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTwenty-one changes were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the ammonia system was analyzed in July 2002.  The recommended changes have been evaluated and will be implemented as required."
