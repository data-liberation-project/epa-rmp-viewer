The plant is a secondary treatment facility with a hydraulic capacity of 6.0MGD and organic capacity of 6900lbs/day. The facility uses chlorine gas, which is considered hazardous by the EPA. Chlorine is a regulated substance under 40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements and meets the minimum requirements set forth in the EPA Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency policy at the plant is to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own employees, contractor employees, and to reduce the risk to nearby members of the community. Safe operations of the disinfection process which uses chlorine gas depends on the manner in which we manage this substance, combined with the safety devices inherent in each process design, handling procedures, inspection procedures, maintenance procedures and the proper training of employees in all of the procedures.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled is chlorine gas utilized in the disinfection process of the plant. The chlorine is infected through a solution feeder into the wastewater as it enters the chlorine contact tanks. A single one ton cylinder is used at time within the main control building. Maximum storage capacity at the plant is 6,000 lbs with an average daily storage of 3,000lbs.\n\nMid-State Chemical of Altoona, Pa supplies the chlorine and delivers two one ton cylinders at a time.
