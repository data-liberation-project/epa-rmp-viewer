      "SummaryText": "A team was assembled to conduct a PHA on the acetylene cylinder storage process at the Palmer Alaska fill plant.  The purpose of the Process Hazard Analysis and the methods to be used were discussed.  Prior to starting the actual PHA of the acetylene storage process, the team reviewed all process safety information.  Additionally a review of human factors with respect to the covered process and facility siting factors were considered.  Members of the HAZOP Team were selected on the basis of those who might offer the most experiences and resources to conduct an accurate analysis of the process.  The original PHA was conducted July 18, 2017. A subsequent PHA was conducted 11/4/2019 with a revalidation PHA 5/28/24. An internal RMP audit was also conducted 11/16/2022 to validate conformance with methodology and implementation of the RMP program. As of reporting year 2023, maximum inventory remained under the 10,000lb reporting threshold."
