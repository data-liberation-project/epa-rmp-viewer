As part of this commitment, G-P/ Crossett has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency.  (EPA) Regulation 40CFR68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (The RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP Plan) describing the Risk Management Program at G-P Crossett.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements \n\nA hazard assessment of help understand (a) the potential off site consequences o hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide and chlorine).\n\nA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes).\n\nAn emergency response program to respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes\n\nA management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Program.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP plan\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at G-P/Crossett.

When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nG-P/ Crossett limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.

As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) for the use of bleaching pulp.  The facility also stores and uses chlorine in one-ton cylinders for water treatment.  The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3.\n\n1.3    Off-Site Consequence Analysis \n\nG-P /Crossett performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like G-P/Crossett and, (2) would result in an of-site consequence if the release occurred. The alternative release G-P/ Crossett and (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred.
