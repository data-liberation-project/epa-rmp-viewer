As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) for the use of bleaching pulp.  The facility also stores and uses chlorine in one-ton cylinders for water treatment.  The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3.\n\n1.3\tOff-Site Consequence Analysis \n\nG-P /Crossett performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like G-P/Crossett and, (2) would result in an of-site consequence if the release occurred. The alternative release G-P/ Crossett and (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred.
