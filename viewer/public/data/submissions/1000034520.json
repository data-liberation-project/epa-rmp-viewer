Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center.  We store and distribute a wide variety of fertilizers including aqueous ammonia.  We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of these products at our facilities.  \r\n\r\nIt is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling aqueous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. \r\n\r\n It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle aqueous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated response actions with the local fire department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training, has submitted information for the county emergency plan; and,  has  instructed employees on  procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\r\n\t\r\n Aqueous ammonia is received by trucks and is stored in bulk and portable tanks.  This facility has equipment for unloading transports and equipment to load semis.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, customers and authorized contractors. \r\n\r\n3.

The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \r\n\r\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Periodic inspections by the Indiana State Chemists Office are also conducted.  Employees involved in aqueous ammonia activities are trained thoroughly by our Safety Coordinator, contractor and insurance companies, and industry experts.  Competency is measured through written and oral testing, demonstration (hands-on), and observation.\r\n\r\nThe major hazards identified with aqueous ammonia include toxic release, overfilling, equipment failure, earthquake, and tornado. \r\n\r\nCheck valves and manual shutoffs are utilized to minimize the potential for release. \r\n\r\nMaintenance programs are in place.  Items are replaced if they fail, present a risk to the user, are required by law or standard, are out-of-date, or if a system or process is changed or upgraded.  The Indiana State Chemist also makes periodic unannounced visits to our facility to inspect equipment, tanks, and safety training (they do not always leave documentation).  In addition, employees utilizing the equipment on a nearly daily basis informally inspect the equipment for leaks, cracks, soundness, etc.\r\n\r\n5. Five-year accident history. \r\n\r\nThis is a new facility and has not had a release.\r\n\r\n6. The emergency response program.\r\n\r\nThis facility has an emergency action plan, in accordance"
