We resolve all findings from our reviews of proposed changes to facilities, equipment, and operations and from analyses of process hazards. Some findings of this type can result in modifications to the process. the prevention program, or administrative controls. The following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility during the next 5 years to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\nThis new facility contains a storage building for the chlorine cylinders as well as a State-of-the-art feed system.

Procedures are in place governing the establishment of the plant's Emergency Operation Center where management personnel can direct and control emergency operations on an as-needed basis.\n\nIn addition, we have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the C/WEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. We have around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g.., contracted chlorine emergency response [HAZMAT] teams, local fire department, police department).

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the public, as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\nA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation\n\nA summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\nAn overview of our accidental release prevention program\n\nA 5-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule \nAn overview of  our emergency response program\nAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our associates,\tcontractors, the public, and the environment \n\nHuntington Water Treatment Plant Regulated Substances\n\nThe Huntington Water Treatment Plant is a water treatment facility that takes raw river water from the Ohio River in Huntington, West Virginia, and treats the river water with chlorine and other chemicals to make potable (drinking) quality water for public distribution and consumption.

Three containers are connected to the same piping manifold at a time. An alternate supply arrangement consists of two additional ton containers connected to a parallel, but normally isolated, feed piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a gas to chlorine vacuum regulators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the chlorinators into the water stream. Currently we store the reserve containers of chlorine inside. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS's can be used to help the Cabell/Wayne (local) Emergency Planning Committee (C/WEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with C/WEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses. For these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occur. In all cases, if such events occur, we would activate our emergency response plan to respond to the event notify local authorit"

The paragraphs below briefly describe the scenarios we have included in our risk management plan (RMPlan), including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures we have put in place to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\t\tWorst-case Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nThe worst case scenario at our water treatment facility involves a failure of a ton container holding approximately 2000 lbs of liquefied chlorine gas under pressure, resulting in a release with vaporization of the entire contents of the container. In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid outdoors of our water treatment building. Since this facility is located in a populated area,the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\t\nCurrently, the Huntington Water Treatment Plant has a new State-of-the-art facility including a chlorine feed/storage area. The new facility contains a chlorine scrubber and other updated controls and computerization. \n\nNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and should one occur, to provide for effective emergency response. Controls include container design, storage, operation, maintenance and inspection; container repair and emergency response equipment; and personnel training conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, chlorine industry standards and practices, and our company\u00c2\u00bfs corporate policies and procedures, which are strictly enforced at the water treatment plant.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nOur alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a chlorine release of approximately 4000 lbs through a broken flexible connection (pigtail) between either of two connected chlorine containers and a common supply manifold in the liquid piping to our chlorine feed system.

Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for the partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nAs in the WCS, we have taken a very conservative approach to determining the ARS endpoint distance off-site. Therefore, in determining the ARS endpoint distance we have not taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered safeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors. The chlorine leak detection system is calibrated toinitiate alarms at very low concentrations of chlorine (i.e., lower than industry recommended settings). Some of our additional engineering safeguards are outlined in the following section of this summary and include isolation valves. Isolation valves are provided in the downstream chlorine feed system to isolate downstream chlorine sources from the pigtail leak.  As stated in the description of the WCS, numerous administrative controls are in place to\tprevent a release of this type and to provide effective emergency response should one occur.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our site/facility emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps for Chlorine\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.
