Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\n6.Emergency Response Plan\r\nCity of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nRockingham County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. Managers from our plant regularly attend and participate in the LEPC meetings.\r\n\r\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  These changes were implemented before June 23, 1999.  There are no planned changes in our process, operation, procedures or emergency response at this time."

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist and What-Ifs.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with thorough knowledge of the mechanical equipment and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of no less than 36 months.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 8/20/2013.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, City of Eden, Robert A.

Harris Water plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass filtration and production of drinking water.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  Chlorine is used for bacterial disinfection.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 22000.00 lb.\r\n\r\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Disinfection.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 9.1% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 5.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release"
