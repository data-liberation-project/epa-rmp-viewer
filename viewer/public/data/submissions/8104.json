The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures we use and the training of personnel.  Our emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Abilene Fire Department and on going coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled - The primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute chlorine to municipal water and wastewater treatment plants and general industry.  Chlorine is received in rail car quantity, after which it is used in the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite (bleach), as well as in filling Department of Transportation (DOT) containers for use by customers.  This facility has equipment for unloading rail cars and equipment to fill DOT containers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nWorst Case Chlorine Release Scenario - Failure of a 90 ton rail car could release 180,000 pounds of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire contents would be released as a vapor, which is heavier than air.  The estimated distance to the end point of 3 ppm is 13 miles.\n\nAlternative Chlorine Release Scenario - Release of liquid chlorine occurs inside the Packaging Area due to human failure while filling a ton container.  The estimated distance to the end point of 3 ppm is 0.2 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program - This distr"
