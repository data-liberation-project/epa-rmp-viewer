The plant serves the cities of West Linn, Oregon City, and Gladstone.  The plant, which was built in 1986, is owned and operated by the Clackamas County Water Environment Services Department. Wastewater flows vary from 6 million gallons per day (mgd) in the dry season to 25 mgd in the wet season.  The plant is operated in compliance with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  (NPDES) permit issued by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe Tri-City plant uses the following process to treat wastewater: \n\n7 First screens are used to separate the water from large debris, such as limbs and rags. \n\n7 In grit chambers, air is added to the water to make it lighter so dirt and other heavier particles settle to the bottom.\n\n7 Next, in the primary clarifiers, additional solids are allowed to settle out of the raw wastewater.\n\n7 The main part of wastewater treatment occurs in aeration basins where oxygen is added to the water, creating an environment where beneficial bacteria can grow and reproduce. These bacteria digest unwanted bacteria and organic matter in the raw wastewater. \n\n7 In the secondary clarifiers, the last of the solids are separated from the water as they settle to the bottom. Now, the water and solids go in different directions. \n\n7 The water flows into the chlorine contact chamber where chlorine is added to kill any remaining bacteria. Chlorine is the primary wastewater disinfectant used around the world to reduce pathogens in wastewater and the related risks to public health. It is inexpensive, effective, readily available, and its chemistry is well understood. Chlorine is used because it is a very effective disinfectant that is highly toxic to organisms in the wastewater.  It is this toxicity that creates a risk to people"

Chlorine is one of the regulated chemicals discussed in the following risk management plan. To reduce the risk of such a release, the Tri-City Plant uses a number of safety precautions, which are discussed below.\n\n7 The water is then dechlorinated and tested to make sure it meets wastewater discharge standards before it is discharged to the Willamette River.\n\n7 The solid materials separated from the water during treatment are called biosolids, or sludge. These are allowed to decompose in anaerobic sludge digesters.  This process produces digester gas, composed primarily of methane, which is used as a fuel to heat the digesters and to generate electricity to offset the plant's power needs.  Digester gas is the second regulated chemical discussed in our risk management plan. Once the solids have decomposed they are land applied.\n\nTRI-CITY'S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \nAND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPublic health and safety issues are the greatest concern for the Tri-City Wastewater Treatment Plant because we are responsible for treating wastewater and protecting the quality of the Willamette River.   Plant staff and management are also committed to minimizing the related possible risks presented by those processes used to treat the Tri-City area's wastewater.  \n\nTwo chemicals regulated by EPA's risk management program, chlorine and digester gas, are stored onsite.  The plant also complies with OSHA's process safety management (PSM) rules, which also regulate these chemicals.\n\nThe plant has an integrated risk management program, which consists of staff training, a plant safety program, regular maintenance checks and upgrades, daily plant inspection, and an accidental release prevention program.  The plant's process safety program is audited at least every 3 years. \n\nStaff Training\n\nOperators are trained in formal certification classes, on-the-job d"

Each employee also receives refresher training at least every 3 years, and the plant manager maintains a training record and schedule for all employees.\n\nChlorine \n\nThe chlorine system consists of the following components:\n\n7 1-ton chlorine cylinders (approximately 6.5 feet long and 30 inches in diameter)\n7 Piping systems and components (e.g., valves)\n7 Relief and vent systems\n7 Emergency shutdown systems\n7 Scrubber system\n7 Controls, including monitoring devices, and sensors, alarms, and interlocks\n\nAll of these components are inspected regularly and maintained following the manufacturer's recommendations.  \n\nChlorine is delivered to the Tri-City Plant by truck. Plant Staff trained in chlorine handling procedures use a specially designed crane system to transfer the 1-ton chlorine tanks from the truck to the chlorine building. Each tank is about 6.5 feet long and 30 inches in diameter, about the size of a large water heater.  The chlorine is stored in a leak tight, concrete chlorine building.  \n\nThis building is equipped with a chlorine detection alarm system.  If a release occurs and the chlorine concentration inside the building is less than 10 parts per million (ppm), red lamps over the building doors flash on and off, a \"warning\" light on the control panel turns on,  an alarm horn begins to sound intermittently, and all staff evacuate the building. Trained staff in appropriate safety gear may then reenter the building to find and repair the leak. The alarm system automatically resets itself once chlorine gas is not detected in the building.\n\nIf a release occurs and concentrations inside the building are greater than10 ppm, the red lamps over the building doors remain on, an \"alarm\" light on the control panel turns on, the alarm horn"

      "SummaryText": " sounds constantly, and a \"chlorine leak alarm\" is automatically sent to offsite emergency response personnel. The building is also equipped with a ventilation system and chlorine gas scrubber that is activated automatically if concentrations are greater than 10 ppm. In the event of an accidental release inside the building, a fan pulls the chlorine-laden air through the scrubber, where it comes in contact with a caustic solution that absorbs chlorine vapor.  A high-efficiency mist eliminator then removes residual caustic solution, which is collected in a storage tank.  The scrubber is designed to provide a minimum overall performance of 99.99 percent chlorine removal.  To ensure that the scrubber continues to operate throughout any release, it can only be shut down manually by turning off the system at the control panel. \n\nAnother area where the risk of an accidental release can be reduced is in the chlorine distribution system.  The Tri-City plant uses a vacuum chlorine gas feed system.  In this system, flowing wastewater creates a vacuum that pulls the chlorine out of the storage cylinder and through the delivery piping. The unit will not allow chlorine to flow unless a vacuum is present. If a problem occurs, such as the vacuum line breaking or the ejector failing, the flow of chlorine is automatically halted. \n\nDigester Gas\n\nMethane, a by-product of waste decomposition, is a flammable gas and poses some threat of fire or explosion at the plant. To minimize this risk, the digesters and digester piping  are equipped with pressure relief valves and flame arrestors.  Enclosed spaces where digester gas might collect are equipped with lower explosion limit (LEL) sensors to detect the presence of gas in the room, and the rooms are automatically ventilated if gas is detected.  The digesters also have a system to protect against low-pressure conditions.  Most of the digester gas is used as a fuel onsite; however, the facility also includes a back-up flare system that can"

The Tri-City Plant has developed risk scenarios for both of the chemicals of concern at the plant: chlorine and digester (flammable) gas.  The plant has a capacity to store 13 1-ton chlorine cylinders, a maximum capacity of 26,000 lbs of chlorine, although no more than 10 cylinders are generally stored.  The plant includes two digesters, each with a maximum digester gas storage capacity of 5,500 lbs, for a total capacity of 11,000 lbs.  The digester gas is approximately 70 percent methane.  The balance of the digester gas is primarily made up of carbon dioxide, with small amounts of hydrogen, water vapor, and trace gases.\n\nBased on these capacities, the worst-case and alternative scenarios for both chlorine and digester gas were developed. Chlorine and digester gas scenarios were developed using EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables and Equations\" and EPA's \"Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.\"  In addition, the chlorine scenarios were modeled using the EPA's \"RMP Comp\" program. The resulting scenarios are described below.\n\nChlorine Worst-Case Risk Scenario\n\nThe worst-case risk scenario for chlorine release was based on the rupture of a complete 1-ton cylinder at delivery.  This would place the cylinder outside of the plant's normal safety system, which includes the vacuum delivery system and enclosure with scrubber system described above, which are designed to remove any accidentally released chlorine from the atmosphere.  Consequently, under this scenario, the entire contents of the cylinder would be released directly to the atmosphere.  Threat"

Given the brief time that cylinders are outside the chlorine building, it was assumed that these more common forms of release would occur inside the building and would be mitigated by the scrubber.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario that was modeled for the Tri-City plant was a pipe break in the chlorine distribution room.  This room is adjacent to the chlorine storage room and would not be served by the scrubber.  Because the vacuum valve would close the tank as soon as the vacuum was lost, only that chlorine actually in the pipe when it broke would be released within the building.  Under this scenario, the maximum anticipated release would be 1 lb of chlorine gas, which could affect public health and the environment for up to 1/10 mile before the chlorine gas dispersed sufficiently that it no longer posed a health risk.  \n\nIt should be noted that, although census data indicate that there would be nine people and four residences within 1/10 mile, a visual inspection of the risk zone confirmed that there may be one residence in the area that would be affected under this release scenario.  This discrepancy occurs because the population estimate developed using the Landview III program calculates population based on average population densities.  As in this case, this method can result in an overcount in areas where no people live, such as over water or in an industrial area.\n\nDigester "

      "SummaryText": "Gas Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario that was developed for digester gas was a vapor cloud explosion that would result from the catastrophic failure of one digester tank, resulting in the release of all of the gas from one digester.  These types of explosions have occurred, but are very uncommon.  The resulting explosion would create pressures of 1 psi over atmospheric pressure at a distance of up to 1/10 mile from the explosion site.  Any significant impacts to public health or the environment are expected to occur within this 1/10-mile radius.  As discussed in the Chlorine Gas Alternative Release Scenario above, although the attached RMP submittal indicates that there would be as many as nine residents and four houses within 1/10 mile, a visual inspection of the risk zone confirmed that there may be one residence in the area that would be affected under this worst-case release scenario. The discrepancy results from the method that the Landview III program uses to estimate population.\n\nDigester Gas Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario developed for digester gas assumes a vapor cloud fire results from digester gas venting from the pressure relief valve on top of the digester tanks.  The pressure relief valve is equipped with a flame arrestor to prevent fire from spreading to the tank.  The distance to the lower flammability limit (LFL) of the vapor cloud is 0.06 miles.  Census data indicates that one residence with three people is located within this radius.  Actually, no residences are located within 0.06 miles of either digester.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Tri-City Plant has developed an emergency response plan to meet OSHA requirements (1910.38).

Operators immediately evacuate the chlorine room and implement the Emergency Action Plan.  If the scrubber system is able to maintain chlorine levels below 10 ppm, trained plant operators may re-enter to control the leak.  If levels remain above 10 ppm, offsite, emergency response departments (HAZMAT) respond to the emergency and police or fire personnel conduct a house-to-house notification in the surrounding area, if needed. \n\nPlant personnel respond to small fires using fire extinguishers.  Should a larger incident occur, operators would call the offsite emergency response personnel (Fire Department).\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Tri-City Plant has never had a reportable accident or any incident with offsite consequences.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Tri-City Plant regularly reviews its safety programs to ensure safe operation of the plant and to reduce risks to plant staff and public safety.  We have integrated safety and training programs in place.  No changes to those programs are planned at this time."
