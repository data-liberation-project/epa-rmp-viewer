The following data is typically gathered by the incident investigation team subsequent to the incident:\r\nDate and time of the ?incident? or ?near miss?\r\nTimeliness of incident report to the responding agency\r\nTimeliness of public awareness and/or evacuation measures\r\nDescription of the incident or ?near miss?\r\nAn evaluation of the events that resulted in the incident or ?near miss?\r\nRecommendations to prevent future occurrences of the incident\r\nThe incident investigation policy is delineated in the safety procedures. The investigation results, including the implementation of all recommendations, will be reviewed with facility staff whose job responsibilities are relevant to the findings. Copies of the investigation reports will be maintained on site for a minimum of five years, and will be used during the periodic PHA re-evaluations.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe facility must rely upon the op"

Operational safety is achieved by a constant exchange of information with employees to ensure consideration of their knowledge and experience in all applicable areas of the prevention program. The facility will implement procedures regarding employee participation in the prevention program elements, the hazard assessment, and emergency action program. The written employee participation plan and facility policies will ensure that:\r\nEmployees at all staff levels are participants in the development and implementation of PHAs. \r\nEmployees at all staff levels are participants in the development of the prevention program elements, the hazard assessment, and the emergency action program.\r\nEmployees at all staff levels are given access to PHA data, EAP data, offsite consequence data, plan implementation data, etc.\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nOperational, safety, and environmental issues must be addressed whenever a change occurs at a facility, which involves an affected process or substance. Quite often a change made in one aspect of the process may affect other parts of the process due to facility system integration. Such changes must be reviewed prior to initiation, to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The facility MoC procedures will be used to evaluate all changes to the following types of systems:\r\nProcess chemicals (delivery, storage, handling)\r\nControl technology systems (operation rates, chemicals used, by-products or wastes produced)\r\nEquipment design and construction\r\nOperations and maintenance procedures\r\nOther changes to facility equipment or processes\r\nContractor Safety and Hot Work Program\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement and control of open and/or enclosed ignition sources such as welding equipment, cutting and brazing torches,"

Facility staff, as well as contractor staff, must be aware of such sources and hazards, and must take the proper safety precautions during the timeframe that such work is being undertaken. The facility will develop a Hot Work Permit program, which requires that employees complete the necessary work order and notification forms certifying that the applicable portions of the fire prevention and protection plan requirements are implemented prior to the start of hot work operations.\r\nHot Work Permits will be required for all types of open or enclosed ignition sources such as grinding, burning, welding, and brazing. Work performed on or near affected processes, or in areas not approved for cutting and welding pursuant to the fire prevention plan must also have a Hot Work permit. The Hot Work Permit is voided when the use of the ignition source results in a hazardous situation, when conditions of its issuance change, or when the work task requiring the Hot Work permit has been inactive for more than a pre-determined time period appropriate for the job task.\r\n\r\nThe facility will utilize outside contractors to augment the existing workforce both on a regular basis, as well as during periods of maintenance outages, overhauls and construction. Contractors must comply with the requirements of the Contractor Safety Program. The facility staff has the primary responsibility for ensuring on-site safety and therefore must take the appropriate measures to ensure that all contractors are trained and understand the site specific safety procedures and programs, including, but not limited to:\r\nWork practices, equipment and process knowledge, and safety procedures necessary to perform the job.\r\nEquipment and process hazards identified for the task or job.\r\nEmergency action procedures and knowledge of safety equipment use.\r\nKnowledge of safe work practices.\r\nContractors also"

This scenario results in the release of approximately 52200 pounds of ammonia. Ammonia concentrations reach fence line exposures on the order of 15,000 ppm. The zone of impact, defined as the distance to the ammonia Te value, is 3950m, and covers an approximate area of 4.734 sq.miles, with an affected population per Landview VI of approximately 13,000 individuals (2000 census data adjusted for annual population growth of 3.2%).\r\nThe alternate-case release scenario is the failure of the anhydrous ammonia loading hose with no containment. This scenario results in the release of approximately 75 pounds of ammonia. Ammonia concentrations reach fence line exposures on the order of 70 ppm. There is NO zone of impact for this scenario, as the Te value of 201 ppm is not reached or exceeded at any onsite or offsite location.
