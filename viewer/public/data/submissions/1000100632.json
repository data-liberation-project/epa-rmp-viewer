These documents are used to:\r\n\r\n* train employees,\r\n* perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\r\n* help maintain the equipment.\r\n\r\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the Chlorination Process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility performed and will periodically update process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the Chlorination Process to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  Within this program, the Chlorination Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nTo perform the PHAs, the City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility primarily uses the What-if/Checklist technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team. \r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatm"

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\r\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program - Program 3\r\n\r\nThe City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility Chlorination Process is required by state law, to implement a Program Level 3 Prevention Program which is s"

A primary aspect of this commitment is the City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility system to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, the City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  \r\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility established a management system to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0  City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility handles one substance regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. \r\n\r\nProcess Description: Chlorination\r\nProgram Level: 3\r\nRegulated Substance: Chlorine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0  Hazard Assessment Results\r\n\r\nThe City of Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Facility performed an offsite consequence analy"
