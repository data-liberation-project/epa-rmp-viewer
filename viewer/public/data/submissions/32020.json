Pool Chlor has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1966.\n\nPool Chlor's manager/owner is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The owner administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred on 1966.  The process is located at 3036 East Malaga Avenue, Fresno, CA 93725.  The chlorine transfer process for Pool Chlor, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 22 pound cylinder. These cylinders are used off-site to treat residential swimming pools.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on site is eight one ton containers (16,000 pounds).\n\nThe number of full time employees on site is 2; however, there are 19 route-men that may visit the site each morning to pick up supplies.  These employees work off-site during business hours.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPool Chlor has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas "

      "SummaryText": "Chlorinators.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used in conjunction while transferring chlorine.  There is a chlorine sensor in the area that will alarm in the office if a concentration of 3 ppm is detected.  In the event that the release occurs during off-hours, the alarm company is notified.  The alarm company will contact the on-call employee to investigate the alarm.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Addendum (dated April 4, 2004), the five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there has been no reportable release of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility's emergency procedures, including notification, evacuation, response, cleanup, and training, are included in the Injury Illness and Prevention Program. In the event of a release of chlorine, employees have been trained to notify management.  Management personnel will determine the nature of the incident and determine of outside agencies should be notified.   In the event that the release is uncontrollable, outside agencies (9-1-1, Fresno County Environmental Health, and California Office of Emergency Services) will be notified.   In addition to the outside agency telephone numbers, the Injury Illness and Prevention Program includes the telephone and location of the nearest medical facility (Fresno Community Hospital) and neighboring businesses.\n\nThe facility uses neutralizing agents and/or copious amounts of water to dilute material to contain and clean up any small spill of a hazardous material.  For larger spills, on-site personnel will dial 9-1-1.  Neutralizing agents and fire extinguishers are kept in the work areas.  Employees have been trained in how to use these items.  Work areas are cleaned daily. Each employee knows where the emergency shut-off valves and power switches are located.  Employees have also been instructed to turn off utilities (if necessary) during emergenc"

This includes the use of personal protective equipment including a Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) with full face mask.  They are prepared to assist the Fire Department and County Hazardous Materials Division in the event of a release.\n\nSpill control and containment equipment available to responders include neutralizing agents, cylinder coffins, SCBAs, and a B-Kit. Other emergency response equipment includes personal protective equipment and portable fire extinguishers.  While awaiting professional assistance, on-site responders who are trained in the proper use of emergency response equipment and supplies will contain the release as best as possible.  Upon arrival of emergency response agencies, employees are to surrender cleanup control to emergency personnel, assisting as needed\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPool Chlor has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (September 2002) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (April 2004).  All recommendations resulting from the audit have been completed.  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation revealed that no necessary modifications are needed to ensure a safe operation. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
