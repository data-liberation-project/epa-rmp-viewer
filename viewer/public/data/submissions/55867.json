      "SummaryText": "This is to inform all interested parties that Kemps, LLC in Rochester, MN is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standards and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulations. The main ammonia system has been in operation for many years without any serious accidents. The Risk management programs have ensured employees safety through training programs and reduced the amount of incidences of accidental releases of ammonia.     Over the past 2 years, Kemps, LLC has installed 3 new penthouse units and removed and repiped 13 tanks that are used for holding refrigerated products. We have also installed a new upgraded control system for our refrigeration system. This system is also used to monitor the system with alarms tied into the system. The plant also installed four new ammonia sensors and 3 detectors located in the pressure relief vent header piping in 2007. The room sensors were positioned in the product filling room, raw and pasteurized tank alleys and the space by plant glycol shell and tube heat exchanger. These areas were selected due to the potential for an ammonia release and close proximity to the actual ammonia refrigeration system. The sensors in the pressure relief header piping facilitates knowledge of an ammonia release immediately after a pressure relief valve vents. It is possible for a PRV to release ammonia and never be known due to proper installation of the vent piping ( vents above roof line). The new sensors will document a release, alarm plant and facilitate proper repair to the refrigeration system as a result of the alarm. All seven sensors at electronicallly connected to the central refrigeration control system which provides immediate information to the plant and it's employees. Kemps did have an accidental release in May of 2007. The release occurred due to an equipment failure where a hose ruptured carrying refrigerant to a bed that is used to help harden ice cream ( Amerio). This failure caused Kemps to enact it's emergency evacuati"

The Maintenance staff did a good job of acting quickly and safely to isolate the release to minimize the loss of ammonia. This incident has raised awareness around the flex hoses that are used. We are more closely monitoring them with monthly inspections."
