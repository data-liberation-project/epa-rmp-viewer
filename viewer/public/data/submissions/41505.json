The systems are closed loops, and little or no ammonia is needed annually to replenish minor losses due to routine maintenance.  sustain a milk and nut cooler, a -10 degree F freezer unit, plant process water coolers, and Facility air conditioners.\n\nThe receiver tanks for both systems are equipped with both sight glasses and pressure gauges.  Ther pressure relief valve setting on the tanks is 250 psig, and the vent is to the roof with an appropriate diffuser.  The mechanical rooms sher the receivers are located are equipped with ammonia sensors set at 50 ppm.  The sensors trigger an audio alarm throughout the Plant.  The sensors are replaced annually.  They are calibrated every 30 days and the span is addjusted every 90 days.  At sounding the alarm, the system compressors are automatically shut down and the room exhaust fans are iniated.  Ammonia within the room is exhausted to and through the roof.  Shutdown allows the ammonia in the system to migrate to the cold spots within the system.  \n\nOutside the mechanical rooms, coolers and the -10 degreeF freezer there are alarm lights.  The yellow light alerts the employees in surrounding areas that there is a problem in the system.  They are trained to contact the HVAC technicial immediately.  The red light indicates an evacuation warning.  Upon observing the red alarm light, employees evacuate through exits on all sides of the productio building.  Personnel have  been instructed to move upwind of the Plant once outside.  \n\nBoth refrigeration syhstems are visually inspected daily by the operators.  In addition to the ammonia sensors, there are either equipment electric panel lights or computer monitoring readings for temperature, pressure and/or liquid level on all pressurized elements of the systems.
