Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management of Fresh Express is committed to maintaining a safe work environment.  A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained an Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n\n1.2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 900 E. Blanco Road in Salinas, California.  The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\n\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 53,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Two (2) transportable (skid mounted) ammonia refrigeration systems are often located on the site, but are not interconnected to the fixed system and are not considered part of the A?processA? for this RMP.\n\n1.3.    Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the volume of the dual High Pressure Receivers (a maximum of (32,000 lbs) .  No administrative controls and mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 2.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia from a ruptured liquid line caused by thermal expansion due to doubl"

No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario even though line lockout/tagout (an administrative control) exists.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 mile.\n\n1.4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at Fresh Express is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.  \n\nThis includes:\n\nA?    Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification\n\nA?    Performance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information\n\nA?    Implementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed by PHA\n\nA?    Appropriate initial and refresher training of system operations and maintenance personnel  \n\nA?    Performance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout and hot work permit programs\n\nA?    Application of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols\n\nA?    Use of qualified contractors for work on the system\n\nThe detailed Prevention Program for the system is contained in a supporting document (revised and updated June, 2009), which is maintained at the siteA?s Safety Office.\n\n1.5.    Five Year Accident History\n\nBetween June, 2003 (the previous revalidation of the site program) and the present, no ammonia releases resulted in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property d"

Equipment was repaired and additional training was  provided to the Technicians to address such malfunctions in the future. Leak estimated and <5 lbs. This event did not meet the criteria for a reportable accident.\n\nA?    In 2008 A? Ammonia release at the roof level. The investigation determined that approximately 50 lbs of ammonia vapor was released to the air from a pin-hole leak from a failed weld (due to corrosion) in Ammonia Zone 3 Evaporator 10 piping. Entire piping was replaced. Adjacent facilities were notified and the incident was reported to Monterey County Health Department.\n\nA?    In 2009  - On February 24 and 25, 2009 multiple reports of ammonia odors were received within specific areas of the facility. A detailed investigation eventually determined that the cause of the odors were minute cracks that had developed in the plates of a A?Plate and FrameA? chiller. These were allowing small amounts of ammonia to be dissolved in the chilled water A? eventually giving rise to the odors. This event did not meet the criteria for a reportable accident.\n\n1.6.    Emergency Response Program\n\nFresh Express has developed an Emergency Planning and Response document to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to ammonia release emergencies.
