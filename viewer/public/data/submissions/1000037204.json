In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certian procedures that are intended to minimize the hazzards assiciated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the Lohrville, Iowa location is Don Stelling, location manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document.
