The Water Treatment Plant presents the risk of a chlorine release. We have coordinated with our local emergency departments on emergency response and public notification procedures. The Water Treatment Plant has installed a chlorine scrubber automated valves that automatically activate in case chlorine gas is detected by monitors in the chlorine building. All chlorination equipment and chlorine piping are checked on a routine schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nThe Chillicothe Municipal Utilities Water Treatment Plant\nhas taken several safety measures to prevent a chlorine gas\nrelease. The water treatment plant has installed a new\nchlorine scrubber that will activate if chlorine gas\nis detected. It will also shut down the regulators\nin the Chlorine building. All chlorine equipment\nis checked on a routine basis and serviced accordingly to\nmanufactures recommendations. Chillicothe Municipal\nUtilities is committed to provide a safe environment for the\nresidents of the City of Chillicothe. All water plant\npersonnel will be trained in chemical awareness and safe\nhandling of chemicals. The water treatment plant will\ncontinue to upgrade safety equipment as it becomes available\nto us.\n\n\nCHILLICOTHE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY AND THE REGULATED\nSUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Chillicothe Municipal Utilities Water Treatment Plant is\na 4.5 million gallon per day water supply for the city of\nChillicothe, MO. The source of water supply is alluvial\nwells. This water is of good quality but is highly\nmineralized. The treatment process uses calcium oxide (lime)\nfor removal of much of these minerals, commonly known as\nsoftening. Sodium Aluminate is added as a softening aid and\nfor clarification. Carbon dioxide gas is available when\nneeded to make the water non corrosive as it is delivered to\nconsumer. Chlorine gas is added "

As a\nfinal process, the water flows through dual media filters\nfor removal of any suspended material before being delivered\nto the consumer. Chlorine gas is a regulated substance and\nthe water treatment plant has on site 6,000 pounds.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nChillicothe's worst case scenario is a release of 2,000\npounds in 10 minutes.This release would have offsite impact. \nThe offsite impact would include, schools, major industry,\nrecreation areas and residences. The model plan used\nto determine the distance is the (EPA'S RMP*COMP)(TM)\nprogram.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nChillicothe's alternative release scenario is a release of\n900 pounds in 30 minutes.This release would have offsite impact.                                                       \nThe offsite impact would be major industry. There would be no\nschools, prisons, recreation areas or residences in the\nalternative  release scenario. The model plan used to\ndetermine the distance is the (EPA'S RMP*COMP)(TM)\nprogram.\n\nThe safety equipment installed on the chlorination equipment\nwill automatically shut down if chlorine gas is detected \nand automatically turn on the chlorine scrubber in the chlorination \nbuilding, eliminating the possibility of an undetected chlorine\nrelease.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nAs mentioned in the above paragraphs the Chillicothe water\ntreatment plant will begin intense training in chemical\nawareness and handling with all personnel. The water\ntreatment plant has installed safety equipment that will help\nreduce the possibility of a chlorine release. New safety\nequipment will be installed as it becomes available.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nChillicothe  water treatment plant has had no accidental\nchlorine releases in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                 EMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nChillicothe Municipa"

Comprehensive\nemergency action plans, when combined with emergency\nresponse training and drills, can effectively minimize the\nimpact of an accidental release by ensuring proper and quick\nfacility response.\n\n\nSCOPE\n\nEmergency action plans are required for all facilities with\nOHSA PSM and/or EPA RMP regulated processes that conduct\nemergency response. This procedure outlines Chillicothe\nMunicipal Utilities plan for updating and maintaining the\nexisting emergency action plans.\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe Plant Superintendent and RMP Program Manager will be\nresponsible for implementing and maintaining this procedure.\nEmergency action plan reviews and updates, and emergency\nresponse training will be coordinated by the RMP Program\nManager. Training will be scheduled and coordinated by the\nRMP Program Manager., Training will be conducted by\nqualified in-house staff or outside resource (i.e.,\nconsultant, vendor, or other experts).\n\n\nThe Plant Superintendent will ensure that the emergency\nresponse team is adequately staffed and the required\nequipment is supplied and maintained. The Plant\nSuperintendent will coordinate with the community response\norganization.\n\n\nUpdating Existing EAPs\n\nThe EAP will be reviewed annually to ensure that they are\ncurrent and comply with OHSA PSM and EPA RMP regulations. An\nupdated EAP will be prepared that will provide up-to-date,\nfacility-specific information and procedures in the\nfollowing sections:\n\n* Emergency evacuation procedures, routes, and safe assembly\npoints.\n\nImmediately evacuate all personnel by"
