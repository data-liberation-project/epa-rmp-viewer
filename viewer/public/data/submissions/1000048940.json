We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n- An overview of our emergency response program\r\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nOur facility produces mainly commodity organic chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The major products manufacured at the facility are acetic acid, vinyl acetate, ethylene oxide, and ethylene glycol.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\n-Ethylene oxide, produced at a rate of 700 million lb/yr, is used for the local production of ethylene glycol, with the remainder being sold in the merchant market.  The material is stored on site in pressurized and refrigerated spheres.\r\n-Vinyl Acetate, produced at a rate of 750 million lbs/yr, is sold entirely in the merchant market where it is used in paints and adhesives.  The material is stored on site in inerted atmospheric tanks.\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\n-Acetaldehyde is a byproduct in the"

We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\n- Process safety information\r\n- Process hazard analysis\r\n- Operating procedures\r\n- Training\r\n- Mechanical integrity\r\n- Management of change\r\n- Pre-startup review\r\n- Compliance audits\r\n- Incident investigation\r\n- Employee participation\r\n- Contractors\r\n\r\nCommon Work Practices are in place such as energy isolation, hot work permits, and conduct of operations.\r\nConduct of operations includes:\r\n- defining standards for handover of equipment between operations and maintenance, \r\n- following Standard Operating Procedures, \r\n- recertifying operators, \r\n- defining standards for equipment labeling, \r\n- approving and making notifications before removing safety equipment in service, and \r\n- verifying equipment readiness by operations prior to placing in service.\r\n\r\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nIn the ethylene oxide process:\r\n- use of sealless pumps to avoid leaks\r\n- use of rigid insulation with stainless steel sheaths and banding for better fire protection\r\n- use of both refrigeration and pressure in th"
