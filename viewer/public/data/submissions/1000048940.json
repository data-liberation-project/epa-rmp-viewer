We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nOur facility produces mainly commodity organic chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The major products manufacured at the facility are acetic acid, vinyl acetate, ethylene oxide, and ethylene glycol.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\n-Ethylene oxide, produced at a rate of 700 million lb/yr, is used for the local production of ethylene glycol, with the remainder being sold in the merchant market.  The material is stored on site in pressurized and refrigerated spheres.\n\n-Vinyl Acetate, produced at a rate of 750 million lbs/yr, is sold entirely in the merchant market where it is used in paints and adhesives.  The material is stored on site in inerted atmospheric tanks.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\n-Acetaldehyde is a byproduct in the"

We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n- Process safety information\n\n- Process hazard analysis\n\n- Operating procedures\n\n- Training\n\n- Mechanical integrity\n\n- Management of change\n\n- Pre-startup review\n\n- Compliance audits\n\n- Incident investigation\n\n- Employee participation\n\n- Contractors\n\n\n\nCommon Work Practices are in place such as energy isolation, hot work permits, and conduct of operations.\n\nConduct of operations includes:\n\n- defining standards for handover of equipment between operations and maintenance, \n\n- following Standard Operating Procedures, \n\n- recertifying operators, \n\n- defining standards for equipment labeling, \n\n- approving and making notifications before removing safety equipment in service, and \n\n- verifying equipment readiness by operations prior to placing in service.\n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nIn the ethylene oxide process:\n\n- use of sealless pumps to avoid leaks\n\n- use of rigid insulation with stainless steel sheaths and banding for better fire protection\n\n- use of both refrigeration and pressure in th"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting the requirements of the law and our own internal standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past five years there has not been a release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.   \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
