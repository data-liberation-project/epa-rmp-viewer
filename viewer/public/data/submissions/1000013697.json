The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nArctic Glacier is in the process of recommissioning (decommissioned for 8 years)an ice manufacturing plant located in an industrial park just east of Tolleson, Maricopa County, AZ, and will use anhydrous ammonia, an RS, to charge the refrigeration system in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system serves the ice makers, a water chiller, and evaporators for room air cooling.  The system is totally self-contained, and the only losses of ammonia are minor in nature, from periodic oil draining operations, minor valve packing leaks, and the like.  Every few years, additional ammonia is added to the system to replace losses.\n\nThe refrigeration process operates generally as follows.  Compressors raise the pressure and temperature of ammo"

The vapor is condensed to liquid in evaporative condensers located outside the building, transferring heat to circulating water which evaporates.  Fans operate as necessary to increase the rate of water evaporation.  The condensed liquid ammonia drains into the high pressure receiver, and the pressurized liquid enters the suction accumulator vessel also serving as a liquid subcooler.  In the suction accumulator, the high pressure liquid is reduced in temperature from approximately 90 deg. F to approximately 38 deg. F, and reduced in pressure from 165 psig to approximately 57 psig.  The subcooled liquid enters two recirculation accumulator vessels where its temperature and pressure are further reduced.  Liquid ammonia pumps force the cold liquid ammonia through the ice maker heat exchanger plates and the evaporator coils, and as the ammonia picks up heat it partially boils and two-phase flow returns to the respective recirculation accumulators.  Suction piping carries ammonia vapor from each of the two recirculation accumulators and the suction accumulator to the compressors where the refrigeration cycle begins again.\n\nDefrosting is carried out by directing a side stream of hot gas from the compressors to the ice makers and evaporators.  The partially condensed gas is drawn into the suction accumulator.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Arctic Glacier that the receipt and handling of anhydrous ammonia at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Arctic Glacier has gathered safety information on anhydrous ammonia and on the process, equipment and procedures involving anhydrous ammonia; performed a structured assess"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for operations at this facility. The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to anhydrous ammonia have been identified and will be implemented during construction.  These include tagging certain critical liquid ammonia valves with warning labels.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nArctic Glacier's Emergency Response Program applicable to anhydrous ammonia has been coordinated with the City of Tolleson Fire Department and the Maricopa County LEPC.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Arctic Glacier committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.
