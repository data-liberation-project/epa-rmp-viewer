The Company's officers, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the Company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Fresh Mark has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases.  The Emergency Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The Company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nFresh Mark, Carriage Hill Division is a further processing facility.  Meat is trucked in and processed for human consumption.  To preserve the meat and prevent bacteria contamination, an extremely hazardous substances is utilized, anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in the various stages of the process.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFresh Mark, Inc. has developed models of the release scenarios at this facility to identify the potential affected areas.  A commercial computer model, Phast Professional, was used to develop the models. This is not an exact prediction of what would happen in the event of a release, but an estimate of the affected area and the resources needed in the event of a release.\n\nThe worst-case release of ammonia involves the sudden failure of the High Stage Recircul"

Depending on wind direction, residences and businesses at a distance of 5.83 miles could be affected.  Approximately 26,712 people live within a 5.83 mile radius of the facility.  This type of release is not likely to occur because of the stringent construction codes for pressure vessels and annual inspections of the pressure vessels.\n\nThe alternative release of ammonia involves the failure of a 3/4 inch line on the HSR releasing 15,000 pounds of liquid ammonia over a 147 minute period.  Residences up to 0.13 mile from the release would be affected.  Approximately 16 people live within a 0.13 mile radius of the facility  This release was selected because appurtenances are more likely to be broken.  Protective devices are put in place to protect lines from traffic and accidental breaking.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nFresh Mark has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies, and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases.  These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level  when working with highly hazardous materials. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nFresh Mark, Salem facility has not had a reportable accidental release of ammonia during the last five years.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nOn-site emergency response teams are trained to respond to releases, and effectively minimize the release.  Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, police, rescue, etc.)  Drills are conducted biannually for on-site response tea"
