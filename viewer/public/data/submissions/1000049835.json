The C&D above designated locations consist of warehouse storage and shipping areas for the full line of C&D consumer products.  Manufacturing operations and/or administrative offices are also present (or nearby).  The local manufacturing operations are not subject to RMP requirements as no RMP chemical thresholds are associated with the manufacturing processes. \n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe operations affected by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol product in consumer size containers.  Product is received in palletized cases via trailer truck at site loading docks.  The product is moved within the warehouse to a designated aerosol storage location via forklift trucks.  Aerosol product is removed from the warehouse via forklift truck and loaded onto trailers for shipment to customers.  Pallets may be broken down by hand and cases re-palletized to accommodate less than full pallet orders.\n\n\n\nManufacturing operations at the plant do not involve RMP regulated hazardous materials above threshold amounts.  Various hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the finished good aerosol products stored in the warehouse.  Hydrocarbon propellants are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials.  USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for accidental release associated with the handling of hazardous materials.  Additionally, US Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) enforces accident prevention regulations to protect employees.  The aerosol product propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability.  The aggregate volume of flammable mixture in the Level II and Level III aerosol can inventory will exceed the RMP threshold.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThe C&D Distribution Centers have no history of accidental releases associated with"

Program Level 1 facilities are considered by USEPA to present minimal risk to the community.\n\n\n\nC&D has developed programs to comply with the required environmental, health and safety standards.  C&D takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through process management systems and programs which include:\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Assessment\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Operator Training\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Pre-Start up Review\n\n?    Contractor Safety\n\n?    Hot Work Permits\n\n?    Accident Investigation\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nIn addition to C&D's management programs, specially designed systems to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases are also in place.  These include an automatic, early suppression, fast response sprinkler system installed throughout the warehouses.  Aerosol storage racks are segregated by chain link fence and are equipped with in rack sprinkler systems to further mitigate aerosol flammability accidents.  All C&D forklift operators are trained and certified.  The firewater and sprinkler systems are inspected and tested quarterly by an outside independent company. Safety and emergency training of employees is conducted regularly\n\n\n\nEmergency Preparedness and Response\n\n\n\nC&D has an emergency plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies.  The plan is tested on a regular basis through exercises and drills.  The plan is shared with the local Fire Department and county Emergency Services, as appropriate for the warehouse location.  In the event of an emergency affecting the local community, C&D will work closely with the local, county, and state agenci"

C&D trains our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  C&D encourages its employees to suggest improvements or changes that will help minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of programs and equipment, including forklift trucks.
