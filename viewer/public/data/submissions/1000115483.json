The RMP includes descriptions of the prevention program elements, equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with the regulated substance (RS); results of the offsite consequence analysis from a worst-case and alternative release; and emergency response program. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nIt is the policy of RMCSD that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facilities be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public and the environment. RMCSD has an emergency action plan to manage emergency situations and has coordinated emergency response actions with emergency response agencies.  \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nRMCSD produces, treats and distributes domestic water and provides wastewater collection and reclamation services.  Its administrative offices are located at 15160 Jackson Highway, Rancho Murieta, in Sacramento County. RMCSD uses chlorine, a regulated substance (RS), to treat and disinfect water at the water treatment plant on Camino Del Lago Road.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs\nRMCSD implements general accidental release prevention programs following the Risk Management Program prevention program elements. \n\nChemical Specific Release Prevention Steps\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine include installation of chlorine leak detectors and alarm telemetry at the sites, facility specific procedures for ton container receiving, transport, hook"

Automatic shutoff valves which are activated by chlorine leak detectors in the storage room have been installed to limit the quantity released in the event of a release into the room.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents involving chorine at RMCSD facilities in Sacramento County within the past five years which resulted in injuries or offsite effects. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nRMCSD will not respond to uncontrolled releases of chlorine.  RMCSD relies on outside responders to mitigate the release. RMCSD has written an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) applicable to chlorine which consists of actions related to chlorine release emergencies, activating the EAP, evacuation of Facility personnel to designated assembly points, and notification of emergency response agencies. RMCSD has coordinated its emergency response program with the local response agencies.  RMCSD's sites are included in the Sacramento County area plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nImprovements and mitigation measures from the process hazardous analysis include installing a protective cover over the process e-stop button outside the storage room to reduce the accidental activation and performing a new seismic assessment of the process. RMCSD is committed to inherently safer technology and is in the process of moving from the use of chlorine gas to sodium hypochlorite."
