      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Glasscock Hollow Field Production Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This committment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Glasscock Hollow Field Production Facility, located near Evanston, Wyoming, operates typical field separation and compression processes to separate condensate and water from the natural gas stream and compress gas for shipment to further processing at other facilities.  The Glasscock Hollow Field Production Facility has several regulated flammables from methane through pentane that are present in hydrocarbon mixtures.  \n\nAll of the covered processes in the facility are designated as Program 1 under the Risk Managment Plan and handled accordingly.  The facility is considered unmanned and thus is not regulated under the OSHA PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119).\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Glasscock Hollow Field Production Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure contiunued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Glasscock Hollow Field Production Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.  Process area detectors with alarms\n\nRelease"

      "SummaryText": "Containment/Control\n\n1.  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n2.  Valves to permit isolation of the process and to prevent backflow.\n3.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters.\n4.  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n5.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g. backup pumps)\n6.  Atmospheric relief valves\n7.  Process interlocks.\n\nRelease mitigation\n\n1.  Trained emergency response personnel.\n2.  Personal protective equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Glasscock Hollow Field Production Facility experienced NO reportable accidents or off-site impacts in the past 5 years.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Glasscock Hollow Field Production Facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility.  \n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Glasscock Hollow Field Production Facility is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The LEPC is re"

The Glasscock Hollow Field Proction Facility is included in the county\u00bfs emergency response plan and has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Glasscock Hollow Field Production Facility resolves all audit findings, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned over the next few years in response to safety audit findings:\n\n1. Update emergency response procedures\n2. Inspect relief valves\n3. Review operating procedures"
