The program includes written operating procedures, preventative maintenance, and employee training to ensure safe operation of the ammonia process. The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\nThe ammonia process is protected by a deluge system and by process-area ammonia detectors which will set off alarms if a release of ammonia is detected.\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Hillabee Plant has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years, as this is a new process.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Hillabee Plant has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The current plans have been coordinated with the Tallapoosa County Fire Department and the Tallapoosa Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911 and by notifying the Alabama Department of Environmental Management at (334) 271-7730.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Hillabee Plant will implement recommendations from the initial PHA and conduct a Pre-Startup Safety Review."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nHILLABEE POWER PLANT\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Hillabee Power Plant (Hillabee Plant) is a new power generation facility owned and operated by CER Generation, LLC (CER).  CER requires each site to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  CER provides assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training.\n\n2. Description of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Hillabee Plant is located at 152 Brick Plant Road in Alexander City, Alabama.  The plant uses anhydrous ammonia to supply the SCR system, which was installed to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted during the combustion of coal.  NOx reduction is necessary to meet ozone ambient air quality standards and technology-based air permit limits.  The SCR process involves the injection of ammonia into the flue gas that then passes through a catalyst bed of titanium dioxide, tungsten oxide, and vanadium pentoxide in which ammonia and NOx react, yielding harmless nitrogen and water vapor leaving the stack.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in two pressure vessels, each filled to only 85 percent of its capacity as an administrative control.  When filled to the 85 percent level, each vessel holds approximately 12,000 gallons, or 60,000 pounds (lbs), of anhydrous ammonia.  Therefore, the total anhydrous ammonia inventory in the process at any one time is 120,000 lbs.  This exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\n3. General Accidental Release and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Hillabee Plant ammonia process is subject to PSM and has implemented a PSM program.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Hillabee Plant process in the Program 3 level.  The Hillabee facility will use its PSM program as the required RMP Program 3 Prevention Program."
