      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nThe City of Port Arthur Main Wastewater Plant uses chlorine gas, which is considered hazardous by the EPA. The City is committed to their employees in the safe handling of chlorine. We are also committed to reducing the threat to nearby members of the community. All employees are trained in the area of safety when handling chlorine. Our emergency response program will be coordinated with the Port Arthur Fire and Police Departments. Our emergency plan also includes procedures for notifying any affected neighborhoods.\n2. The stationary service and regulated substances handled.\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to treat and disinfect the wastewater effluent. Chlorine is the only toxic chemical over the threshold limit used at this facility. It is received in ton containers and is used for disinfection. The facility has equipment in use for the safe handling and storage of the ton containers. The total inventory of ton chlorine stored at this facility is 32,000 lbs., along with ten or less 150 lbs. cylinders for two sattelite plants that the city maintains.\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to the limit, the distances for each reported scenario.\nWorst case scenario - Rupture of a ton cylinder would release 2000 lbs. of chlorine. An additional 1380 lbs. would escape through the ruptured drum via the manifold system. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air. The distance to the endpoint is 0087 mg/l. All liquid leaks will be handled as a worst case scenario.\nAlternative Release Scenario - A 1/4 inch tubing that extends from the ton cylinder to the manifold, breaks and releases chlorine gas. It is estimated that 500 lbs. of chlorine would be released in a 60 minute time period. Plant personnel will handle the majority of gas leaks as to minimize the release.\n4."

It also includes an inspection check list when changing chlorine cylinders, which is signed by plant personnel when performing this job duty. Specific prevention steps include training of employees for safe handling practices when dealing with chlorine cylinders, along with inspections and maintenance of the chlorine system. Inventory of spare parts that are subject to failure are kept on hand.\n5. Five year history.\nThe Main WWTP has not had any RMP releases during the past five years. ( 1999 - 2004 ).\n6. The emergency response program.\nOur emergency response program will be coordinated through the Port Arthur Fire Department and their Hazmat team. Ton cylinder repair kits will be kept at the wastewater plant, along with Class A encapsulated suits.\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n* Scheduled maintenance of chlorine feed system and safety equipment                                                \n* Continuing education for safe chlorine handling practices\n* Replacement of obsolete chlorine and safety equipment \n* Continued revisions of written operating procedures"
