The City of Sanford Water and Wastewater Treatment Facilities fall under these new rules because they exceed the threshold for chlorine.  Thus, to conform with RMP regulations (FR.61 {120}, pg. 31668); the City of Sanford Facilities must meet the following RMP requirements by June 21, 2004.\n\n*Hazard Assessment \n* Prevention Program \n* Emergency Response Program\n* Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) \n\nThe City of Sanford Utility Department accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedure of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program adhered to.  The emergency response policy involves plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response requirements. \n                                                                                                                                                                                           The City of Sanford Auxiiry Water Plant is located at 3100 Orlando Drive, Sanford.  It has a design capacity of 4.61 Million Gallons Daily (MGD). The drinking water supply is taken from the Floridan aquifer and has similar water quality to many supplies in Central Florida.  The treatment process generally consists or aeration and chlorination."

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is widely used not only for treating municipal and industrial water and wastewater supplies but also in the production of many dyes, insecticide solvents and plastics.  Chlorine gas is a severe respiratory irritant, and liquid chlorine is irritating to the skin.  The gas has a pungent odor detectable at concentrations of less than 1ppm.  A few breaths of 1000 ppm chlorine in the air is likely to be fatal.  \n\nChlorine gas is used in the final stages of the wastewater treatment process for the purpose of disinfecting the clear effluent.  At the WRF gaseous chlorine is continuously fed to the Chlorine Contact Chamber to achieve a 1.5 to 2.0 ppm residual total chlorine level in the effluent.  Typically, about 125 pounds per day of chlorine is used for every 1.0 mg gallons of effluent. \n\nBecause chlorine poses a serious health risk, if release to the atmosphere, chlorine is fed from one-ton containers through a fail-safe device called a chlorinator.  A chlorinator system includes two main components, a vacuum regulator which mounts directly to the upper gas valve of the one-ton chlorine container by means of a lead gasketed positive yoke assembly, and an ejector which uses effluent flow to create the necessary vacuum.  From the ejector the chlorine gas mixes with the effluent before being injected into the chlorine contact chamber through a diffuser.  The feed system from the container to the ejector is operated under the vacuum, so any small leak pull in the air instead of releasing chlorine. \n\n   \nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \u00bfworst case release\u00bf and  \n\u00bfalternative scenario\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \u00bfthe owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released"

The alternative scenario is defined as \u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\u00bf. \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decease to the \u00bftoxic endpoint\u00bf selected by EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines \nLevel 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00bfmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action\u00bf.   The residential population within a circle within a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \u00bfto estimate the population potentially effected\u00bf. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Auxiliary Water Plant involves a failure of the one-container.  The offsite consequences analysis for this scenario was performed for release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic  endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within full circle radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequences analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n(1) Only a fraction (about 26% of the total) of the compresses liquefied chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes as a vapor.  The remaining un-flashed liquid forms liquid forms liquid-droplet aerosols.  This results in the formation of a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristics significantly different than for a cloud consisting only of chlorine gas. \n(2) It is not appropriate to compare a 10- minutes release"

This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6% (one-twentieth) of the area of the full circle. \n\n\nEPA\u00bfmandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (116 Degrees F), and average humidity (65%) were used for both sets. \n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst-case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.30 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 10,882 people was obtained.  \n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the alternative release scenario was performed using the TRACE 8.0 assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of .30 mi and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 890 people was obtained.  The alternative release scenario involves a gas valve remaining open (gas release).   The typical meteorological conditions used were Stability B, wind speed 3.0 m/sec.  \n\nActuation of the chlorine detector is an active mitigation measure considered.
