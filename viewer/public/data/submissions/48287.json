              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In doing so, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

All applicable procedures of the Iowa Fertilizer Law are adhered to. The emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n2. The facility at Maxwell is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer. The location includes anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, nurse tank filling risers, electrical lighting, and anhydrous ammonia safety equipment. The facility is manned during seasonal operating requirements.\n\n3. FC's accidental release prevention plan is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Annual training of all personnel required to handle ammonia and what to do in an emergency.\n\n* Facilities constructed and maintained according to the Iowa Fertilizer Law.\n\n* Use of anhydrous ammonia safety equipment.\n\n* Use of effective operating procedures according to Agricom's anhydrous ammonia safety procedures handbook and training videos.\n\n* Annual inspections by IDALS of storage tanks, piping for leaks, nurse tanks, applicators, transfer risers, riser hoses, safety equipment, pressure relief valves, etc.\n\n* FC site inspections by safety committee members at least twice a year.\n\n4. No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n5. This facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Maxwell Fire Department, which is part of the Story County LEPC in Iowa.This program includes response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency operations and response procedures are reviewed annually, with a site visit of the facility by the Fire Department.\n\n6. Changes to improve safety at this facility are"
