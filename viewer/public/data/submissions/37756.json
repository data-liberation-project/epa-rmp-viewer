      "SummaryText": "CARGILL - FORT PIERCE CITRUS PLANT\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n1.  Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\nThe Cargill Juice Fort Pierce Citrus Plant is a citrus processing and storage facility,\nlocated in Fort Pierce, St. Lucie county, Florida.  Cargill management requires the facility to develop \nand maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate for the site.\n\n2.  Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is used at the plant to freeze concentrate and to chill stored products.\nThe ammonia is brought into the facility and stored in four (4) storage vessels; three within the Main Refrigeration System and one (1) within the New Refrigeration System.\n\nThe Cargill Fort Pierce facility has an ammonia refrigeration system, which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in the machine or compressor room.  The high pressure receiver (HPR) is located outside.  The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, capable of holding approximately 11,100 lbs. Of ammonia.  This vessel was used to determine the OCA for the facility.\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case release scenerio is the rupture of the HPR vessel, releasing 11,100 lbs of ammonia gas over a 10-minute period.  Under the worst case weather conditions and using urban topography, the ammonia gas could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the EPA's RMP Comp program.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenerio is a pipe leak at a mitigated release rate of 316 lb./min. from the HPR liquid supply line due to pipe connection failure from worker/human error or corrosion of the pipe.  Under normally expected weather conditions and using urban topography, the ammonia gas could travel .1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a h"

      "SummaryText": "azard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the EPA's RMP Comp program.\n\n4.  Prevention Program\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for its ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Managemnt (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this also places the Cargil Fort Pierce facility refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The Cargil Fort Pierce facility will uses its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\n5.  Accident History\n\nThe Cargill Fort Pierce facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Cargill Fort Pierce facility has an Emergency Response Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120(q).  The current plan has been coordinated with the Fort Pierce Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Region #10 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made by dialing (772) 221-4060 or 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519."
