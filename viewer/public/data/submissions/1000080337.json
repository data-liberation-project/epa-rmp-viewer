As a municipal agency, plant personnel work closely with appropriate agencies in the City of Bethlehem to assure safe operation of the plant, and expedient response in case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe City of Bethlehem operates a wastewater treatment plant located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The toxic substance maintained as a part of the City of Bethlehem's Wastewater Treatment Plant operations is chlorine.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the treated effluent prior to discharge. The chlorination facilities include a Chlorine Storage Room, and a Chlorine Feed Room.  The chlorine storage room provides an area to store up to eight (8) one-ton containers.  Additional storage for up to 16 one-ton containers is provided outside on the loading dock for a maximum of 24 one-ton containers on site.  However, by policy, the maximum inventory kept on site is 16 one-ton containers.  The EPA regulated threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 pounds (1.25 tons).  All facilities in excess of this quantity are subject to 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility is subject to the program level 2 requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 which requires development of an RMP.\r\n\t\r\nThe chlorine supply system consists of eight (8) one-ton containers (currently four in use and four stand-by).  The chlorine containers are stored on four (4) container scales (each shared by a pair of containers) to keep track of inventory by weight loss.  The containers are connected to a manifold header by means of a yoke and adapter connection, a container isolation valve, and a flexible connection leading to a manifold/vacuum regulator.  From the vacuum regulator, chlo"

      "SummaryText": "rine gas flows under vacuum conditions by means of a remote eductor that uses a flow of utility water to produce a vacuum.  The vacuum regulator between the pressurized and vacuum piping systems contains a gas inlet valve, a pressure relief valve and an automatic switchover device.  The throttling action of the gas inlet valve reduces the varying gas supply pressure to a constantly regulated vacuum.  A loss of vacuum for any reason will cause the gas inlet valve to close automatically.  The pressure relief valve will automatically vent gas to the atmosphere if pressure develops.  The automatic switchover device provides a continuous gas feed by automatically switching to the alternative gas supply when the supply in service is exhausted.  A gas pressure gauge is located on each manifold above the vacuum regulator to provide a visual indication of the gas supply pressure.\r\n\t\r\nTwo rack-mounted 1,000 pound chlorinators and a 500 pound chlorinator meter the chlorine flow rate.  The chlorinator module contains a flow meter, a metering orifice, an automatic-manual feed rate control valve and an ejector vacuum gauge.  A vacuum is created as water flows through the ejector causing the gas inlet valve in the vacuum regulator to open and, with the supply valves open, allows chlorine gas to flow through to the ejector. At the ejector, the chlorine dissolves in water to form hypochlorous acid.  This solution flows through the distribution lines to the chlorine contact tank.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nThe facility approaches release prevention by assuring that its containers, feed lines, valves and other mechanical apparatus in the chlorine supply system adhere to applicable ASTM and ANSI standards, as well as providing training to its employees which allows them to safely and efficiently carry out their duties.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\nThere have been no releases during the five year period from June 2014 through Jun"

      "SummaryText": "e 2019. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nThere are two chlorine gas detectors, one located in the Chlorine Storage Room and one in the Chlorine Feed Room.  These detectors continuously monitor the activity in these locations.  A chlorine alarm will sound if the chlorine concentration exceeds 1 ppm chlorine by volume of air.  The alarm will be activated in the Control Building to notify personnel.  If there is a leak of liquid chlorine from a container, the liquid spill on the floor will quickly flash off into the air as a vapor, and the detectors will activate the alarm in the control building.  The system automatically activates the actuator to close the chlorine cylinder valves in the event of an emergency or detected chlorine leak.  All control panel electrical components are supplied with AC power through the uninterruptible power supply (UPS).  These components will remain energized after the supply voltage to the control panel has been removed.\r\n\r\nBecause the facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC 11003, it is exempted from compliance with the emergency response program requirements at 40 CFR 68.95.  In the event of a release, a City of Bethlehem Facility Emergency Coordinator will be notified.  As explained in the Offsite Emergency Plan, facility personnel will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances if the category of emergency is 2, 3 or 4.  The City of Bethlehem Emergency Coordinator on duty will immediately notify the Northampton County Emergency Management Agency, the local fire department and other appropriate agencies.  In the event of a Category 1 release, defined as a minor leak, confined within the facility and contained on site, City of Bethlehem wastewater treatment plant personnel will refer to SOP OP#038 Chlorine System Operation Troubleshooting and Emergency Procedures. \r\n\r\nIn the event the City of Bethlehem fire department has been notified, The City of Bethlehem Fire Department"
