      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Public Service Company of Colorado (PSC) Baxter Compressor Station.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are represented in the Emergency Planning and Response Sections of the Baxter Compressor Station RMP manual for the natural gas condensate system. PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nPSC management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the RMP manual.  Additionally, PSC has determined that, despite qualification for Program 2 compliance, it is prudent to establish and maintain Program 3 compliance as a conservative safety and business approach.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Baxter Compressor Station processes 5-10 mmscf/day of natural gas produced from the Dakota formation in western Colorado.  The station provides compression, dehydration, and recovery of liquid hydrocarbon compounds (natural gas condensate).  Most of the gas processed at the station is distributed for local residential use.\n\nThe triethylene glycol (TEG) dehydrator removes water from the compressed natural gas by contacting \"lean\" glycol with the wet gas in a contactor tower.  Generally, wet gas enters the bottom of the tower and lean glycol enters the top.  Water and some higher molecular weight hydrocar"

      "SummaryText": "bons are absorbed by the glycol stream in the contactor.  The \"rich\" glycol exits the bottom of the tower and is fed to the regenerator, where it is heated to drive off water vapor.  In the regenerator process, some hydrocarbons absorbed from the gas stream are driven off with the water vapor.  The regenerated (lean) glycol returns to the contactor tower, and the dry gas exits the tower at the top.\n\nBaxter Compressor Station employs a technology recently developed by the Gas Research Institute (GRI) to reduce emissions of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (collectively known as BTEX) from the offgas of the glycol dehydration units.  The R-BTEX process uses evaporative cooling to achieve emission control rather than conventional air-cooled or glycol-cooled condensation technologies.  The condenser outlet temperature average 11o F below the ambient temperature, which allows for better emission control performance without the use of auxiliary refrigeration systems.\n\nThe offgas enters an air-cooled condenser, which condenses a significant fraction of the gas.  This vapor/liquid stream then enters the water-cooled condenser, where all components but the light gases are condensed.  The three phases are then separated:  the water recycled for evaporative cooling, the hydrocarbons/condensate decanted and stored for subsequent sale or use in the two condensate storage tanks, and the noncondensable gas released to the atmosphere.  An auxiliary gas-fired heater prevents the condensed water from freezing in severe weather.\n\nOne of the two condensate tanks has a maximum intended inventory of 10,822 gallons (54,759 pounds), while the second condensate tank has a maximum intended inventory of 4530 gallons (22,922 pounds).  Filling of the tanks is administratively limited to 80% of the tank capacity by NFPA 58 requirements, as corrected for facility elevation.\n\nThe RMP-regulated portion of the facility starts at the bypass between the dehydrator and the J-T skid.

      "SummaryText": "-regulated process includes the J-T skid, the condenser, and the condensate storage.  Since the BTEX (from the emission control process) and the condensate are co-mingled, the RMP process includes the piping from the condensate storage tanks back toward the BTEX emission control process.  The inclusion of the BTEX emission control process stops at the check valve after the pump at the BTEX condenser.  The balance of the facility is regulated under the DOT Pipeline Safety regulations Parts 190-199.\n\nThis is a remote and unmanned facility exempt from OSHA PSM requirements.  However, PSC operators perform periodic system checks and maintenance at the plant.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (the 10,822 gallon condensate tank or 54,759 pounds of natural gas condensate) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  Reference Table 9 of the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance (dated May 24, 1996) was used to determine the distance to overpressure of 1.0 psi for a vapor cloud explosion of condensate.  A distance of 0.31 miles to the flammable endpoint was determined for a release of 54,759 pounds in ten minutes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for condensate consists of a release of 6709 pounds of natural gas condensate over a one-hour period due to continued release (and potential failure open) from a 5/16 inch relief valve on the tank.  No active mitigation devices were considered to influence the release scenario.  The ALOHA air dispersion model was used to determine the volume of condensate that would be released in sixty minutes, and Reference Table 9 of the R"

The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Baxter Compressor Station RMP program, a process hazard analysis was conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.
