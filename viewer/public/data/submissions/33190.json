All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed.  The WWTP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and meets the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements as prepared in 1999.  This plan represents an update to the 1999 Risk Management Plan as required by EPA under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe City of Attleboro WWTP, located at 106 Pond Street, Attleboro, Massachusetts, is required to provide disinfection of the effluent water before it's discharge to the Ten Mile River.  These requirements are outlined in the permit (NPDES) issued to the City by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  The City presently utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection to meet the minimum standards of the permit.    Four one-ton containers of pressurized liquid chlorine are connected to the disinfection system.  Additional four cylinders of chlorine is stored in one-ton containers in the same building not manifolded to the chlorination system.  \n\nThe City plans to eliminate the use of chlorine gas and change the system to sodium hypochlorite.  This recommendation was made because of the hazards involved with the use of chlorine gas.\n\nDisinfection by sodium hypochlorite should be in operation at the Attleboro WWTP by 2005. \n\nThe general WWTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following critical elements: \n- High level of training of operators\n- Preventive maintenance program\n- Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n- Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n- Performance of a hazard review of equipment and"

This program includes an emergency coordination team, and a notification plan."
