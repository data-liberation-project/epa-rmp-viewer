The following elements are addressed in the program:\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPreventing the release of toxic chemicals is of paramount importance at the Corn Plant due to the serious acute health effects that may result from even a short exposure.  Management has made it clear that all leaks are to be taken seriously and that operation of the systems is expected to be performed in a careful and professional manner.  Emergency Response policy is predicated on the serious nature of any toxic chemical leak, and stresses the importance of calling in properly trained and equipped professionals when a leak is beyond the capabilities on on-site employees.\n\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Corn Plant is owned by Archer Daniels Midland Company and is located at 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois, 62526.  The facility utilizes the wet corn milling process to produce two primary products:  high fructose corn syrup and fuel-grade ethanol.  A byproduct of the ethanol production process is large quantities of CO2.  After collecting the CO2, the Corn Plant uses anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to liquefy it and store it for sale to end customers.  The ethanol production process also requires chilled water for certain reactions.  This chilled water is created by using separate anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems which are located in a completely separate area of the plant.\n\n3.\tWorst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario was built on the assumption that all four ammonia chiller process systems are ruptured and discharge their contents over a ten minute period.  Such a scenario is"

      "SummaryText": "extremely unlikely, but could occur due to a weather event such as a tornado, or possibly a construction accident involving the chiller building.\n\nAlternative release scenarios for both the CO2 process and chiller process systems involve the case of an individual compressor system experiencing a piping flange gasket failure and emptying the contents of one system over a ten minute period.\n\nThe worst case scenario is rendered unlikely by safe operating procedures and the physical separation of each ammonia compressor system.  The risk of the alternative release scenarios is mitigated by preventative maintenance procedures, online leak detectors, and the ability of responders to contain a small ammonia plume with a water mist.\n \n\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe accidental release prevention program ammonia-specific prevention steps are detailed in the Corn Plant\u00bfs Chemical Management Program for the ammonia refrigeration areas.  This program is maintained by the Safety Department and covers areas such as standard operating procedures, employee training, etc.\n\n5.\tFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years from the date of this plan, the Corn Plant has had one accidental release from one of the ammonia RMP areas.  On December 27, 2001, a one-inch ball valve either vibrated open or was left open which allowed approximately 1200 pounds of ammonia to escape.  Corn Plant personnel were able to close the valve and stop the release and no injuries resulted.  The released ammonia did not appear to reach ADM property boundaries in detectable quantities.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Corn Plant emergency response procedures are detailed in the Chemical Management Program which is maintained by the Safety Department.  Essentially, small leaks will be handled by properly trained Corn Plant employees, while more significant leaks will require the assistance of outside responders.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Impr"
