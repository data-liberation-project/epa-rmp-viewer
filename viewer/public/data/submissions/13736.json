      "SummaryText": "This will serve as an overview of the previous sections pertaining to the RMP Report  for Eugene T. Mahoney State Park of Ashland, Nebraska. This requirement is a provision of Wection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, 40 CFR Part 68 regaardding prevention and management of accidental releases.  James A. Swenson is the Head Superintendent and is ultimately responsible for the implemetation of the plan. Mark R. Huston and Mr. Swenson would both be available in an emergency.             We store chlorine at our pool facility and at the start of the season we have the maximum stored of the dry tablets. The worst case scenario is based on fire within the storage area at the pool. This would produce a gas that would be toxic to anyone who would inhale the gas. As shown in Section 2, the estimated population is based on pool guests and park guests staying in both rentable cabins and lodge(hotel) rooms. Although we are located in a rural environment, according to your definition, we would be classified as an urban topography with many obstacles.           The Alternative Release is based from a more true to life or actual potential for an accident. This would be in the mising room for the pool operation. Where the chlorinators and pumps are working. This scenerio would potentially effect the park guests using the pool facility. This potential would be in liquid form and be less hazardous than a gas exposure.                We have had no accidents with chlorine at our facility.             Every year when the supply arrives, we go over the Material Safety Data Sheets and confirm the proper storage and handling of this material. with this being the first year required to process a RMP, we have not had the opportunity the draft an Emergency Response Plan within the park. The appropriate agencies are aware of the storage of chlorine(local fire and the LECP. These are reported to these agencies annually through the Tier II program."
