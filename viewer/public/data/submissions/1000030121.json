Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Dakota Plains Cooperative in Valley City (Cuba Location), North Dakota are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We also coordinate our response efforts with the Valley City, ND, Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response information and expertise.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled Our facility's primary activities include support services for crop production. We have anhydrous ammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank, Twelve 1,000-gallon, Fifteen 1450 gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Cuba, North Dakota. The maximum amount stored is 54,187 gallons (279,065 pounds) at 85% standard maximum storage capacity including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks. The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,325 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios (NOTE: #3 Available only to\n\nCounty Emergency Manager, Fire Department and Dakota Plains Cooperative - not included with disk to EPA for public access per Federal Regulation posted 2004)\n\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program Our facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nDakota Plains Cooperative maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely. These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nDakota Plains Cooperative has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that all employees who are involved with operating processes and procedures are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nDakota Plains Cooperative conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Dakota Plains Cooperative to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and receive training to deal with it.\n\n\n\n"
