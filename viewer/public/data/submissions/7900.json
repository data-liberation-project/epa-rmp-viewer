This is a comprehensive plan that encompasses all aspects of the City of Oldsmar's WWF methods and procedures of receiving, handling, processing and worst as well as alternative accidental release scenarios of hazardous chemicals on site. \n\n\n\tEmergency response Policies:\n\nThe City of Oldsmar Wastewater Facility's response to emergencies is controlled by 4 main elements/policies: \n\nX Risk Management Plan\nX Process Safety Management\nX Chlorine Emergency Response Action Plan\nX Sulfur Dioxide Emergency Response Action Plan\n\n\n\nThe management of the City of Oldsmar's Wastewater Facility has had a safety program in effect since 1991. Since inception, the program has undergone extensive change. The evolution process has taken this program from the early planning, research and development stages to a well defined, structured and to this date, safe & successful program. This is evidenced by a track record with respect to \"employee time lost\" and \"vehicle time lost, accident\" awards received from the National Safety Council.

It is our understanding that City of Oldsmar WWF will be conducting a Process Hazard Analysis Team meeting and will update the What-If Scenarios for both systems.  The final What-If Scenarios will be inserted into the individual RMP sections. \n Task 2 - Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide - Worst-case release scenario modeling\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68 Subpart B - Hazard Assessment, facilities which are defined as Program 3 are required to evaluate one worst-case release scenario analysis in the RMP for each regulated substance at the facility.  The RMP rule defines the worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or a process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint\". The worst-case release quantity is the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account any administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.   \n\nEPA established \"endpoints\" for release modeling analysis, which would result in no adverse impact to public health.  For toxins, the endpoint is the chemical concentration in the air to which a person can be exposed to up to an hour without serious health effects.  EPA's endpoint concentration for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide is 3 ppm.  Air dispersion modeling using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved RMP* Comp was performed to calculate the impacts of; one (1) ton (2,000 lbs) cylinder of chlorine and anoth"

The distance to the toxic endpoint for the Chlorine worst-case scenario is 0.96 miles.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the Sulfur Dioxide worst-case scenario is 0.94 miles.\n\nIn accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 68.30, the off-site impacts resulting from a worst-case release scenario are evaluated by estimating the population within a circle with its center at the point of release and a radius equal to the distance to the endpoint.  Therefore, under the worst-case release scenario, a circular area with a calculated radius of 0.96 miles (mi.) from the Chlorine system and 0.94 mi. from the Sulfur Dioxide system around the facility could be potentially affected  (See Figure 1).\n\nThe WWF lies within City of Oldsmar in Pinellas county, Florida.  According to the latest information attainable from the U.S. Census Bureau, City of Oldsmar has a population density of 933.8 population/square mile (U.S. Census Bureau 1990).

The alternative release scenario can be venting of one of the covered process systems due to a component failure (i.e., container, piping) that results in concentrations above the toxic endpoint beyond the property line.  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) (40 CFR 68.67), which is part of the prevention program, states that an alternative release scenario must reach an endpoint off-site, unless no such alternative release scen"
