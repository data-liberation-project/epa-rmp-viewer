This\n\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\n\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\n\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\n\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\n\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Osborne plant, located in rural Roberts County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to\n\nrecover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane) from field gas.  There are no threshold quantities of\n\ntoxic substances present.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Osborne\n\nplant.  Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection\n\nAgency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM)\n\nstandard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the\n\nmanagement system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Osborne plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety\n\nmanagement and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating\n\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\n\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\n\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the\n\naccident prevention program are doc"

These documents address chemical properties and associated\n\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\n\ndesign basis/configuration information.  Specific departments are assigned responsibility for\n\nmaintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The reference documents and their location is\n\nreadily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any\n\nnecessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\n\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is\n\nsupplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known\n\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas\n\nplant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,\n\nlevel, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\n\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\n\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe gas plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and\n\nconstruction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design\n\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information provides a\n\nbasis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluati"

Within this program, each process is\n\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\n\nmanage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The\n\nanalyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience\n\nas well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well\n\nas accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional\n\nprevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. \n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk\n\nranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team\n\nfindings are tracked until they are completed.
