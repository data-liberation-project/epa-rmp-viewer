This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System and Aqueous Ammonia Storage System.  The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 21,800-gallon (gal) storage tank (bullet tank) at the site.   The Wilbur-Ellis, Dixon facility also stored up to 30 1,000-gallon nurse tanks that could contain anhydrous ammonia at any given time.  The facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity to 82 percent (%) of the fill capacity for both covered processes.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 162,020 pounds (lb.). Aqua ammonia (24% of quantity by weight) is stored in two 25,000-gallon above-ground storage tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of ammonia handled is 45,240 pounds (lb.).\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case/Alternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\n\nPer CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario have been defined for each process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalation hazard; and thus, the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the commun"

The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis, Hazard Assessment, and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the potential of a release from the identified risks.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 2 and Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.

Specifically, the external events requirements were met with the following actions:\n\n   1)    The types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA ?2760.2 or Hazard Review (HR) ?2755.2.  During the PHA, a broad list of external events was considered by the Study Team.  The external events that were consid"
