The George Gray Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe George Gray Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe George Gray Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.   Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety feature, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally read.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe George Gray Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness).

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the George Gray Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe George Gray Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) Initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) Emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) Start-up following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe George Gray Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the George Gray Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to George Gray Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation's.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, DCP Midstream periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Personnel from other gas plants compose the Audit Team.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures.  In addition the George Gray Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as necessary.  Any significant changes to the emergency response program are administered through the management of change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\n The overall emergency response program for the George Gray Plant is coordinated with the Carthage Volunteer Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the gas plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.  The George Gray Plant provides training and equipment to local emergency responders so that they are familiar with any unique hazards that they may encounter when responding to emergencies at our facilities. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nImplement MAXIMO program for all equipment preventive maintenance (trackin"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safety and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nThe George Gray Plant, located 5 miles north of Carthage, Texas on County Road 306, operates a cryogenic gas plant to remove liquids from gas wells.  The George Gray Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. It processes approximately 120 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  The George Gray Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the George Gray Plant.  Because processes at the George Gray Plant that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the George Gray Plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the George Gray Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, The George Gray Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a safety committee to promote both process and personal safety.  The committee typically has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, and local plant management. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe George Gray Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific employees within the George Gray Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  This information is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets.

For specific process areas, the George Gray Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The George Gray Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\nThe George Gray Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)  \r\n\r\nThe George Gray Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe George Gray Plant primarily uses the HAZ-OP and What-if/Check list analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  This analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.
