It is the stated policy of GE Lighting to safely manage our site operations.  In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur. \n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.  To further that objective, we held a public meeting on May 24, 1999 to discuss the implications of this Risk Management Plan with the community.  If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plans, please contact our Community Relations Representative at (606) 425-1224.\n\nSince our initial Risk Management Plan was submitted in June of 1999, we have taken several significant steps to improve the safety and efficiency of the component of our manufacturing operation that uses highly hazardous chemicals.   Since these changes involved major modifications to plant equipment and operating practices, we have elected to revise and re-submit this Risk Management Plan.  For a description of some of these important changes, see section of this document entitled Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound manufacturing facilities everywhere we do business.  Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  \n\nIn order to provide top quality products for our customers, the GE Lighting Kentucky Glass Plant uses in its manufacturing process a chemical, hydrofluoric acid (HF) that is classified as toxic.  We are c"

Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.  However, under the unlikely event that a major release would occur, we immediately notify the local Emergency Response Team of the Fire Department. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe GE Lighting facility located at 200 West Loudon Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky produces glass for light bulbs of various applications in commercial and residential use.  One step in producing one line of light bulbs is to frost the glass in order to provide an opaque type surface on the inside of the bulb to aid in diffusing light from the filament  The Kentucky Glass Plant uses aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF) in the frosting of light bulb glass.  Hydrofluoric acid is diluted to produce the solutions that are sprayed into the inside of the bulbs. Several steps are required in the frosting operation to initially etch, rinse and then properly fortify the bulbs for strength.\n\nThe HF is received by tanker truck and is transferred to a storage tank that is contained in a totally enclosed building.  When needed, HF is transferred from the storage tank to mixing tank for dilution to the concentrations needed to produce the proper frosting solutions.  Other ingredients are also added at this time to the solutions.  The solutions are then pumped to holding tanks that supply the spray heads used to frost the glass bulbs.  Spent solutions are neutralized on site. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nAs part of our risk management planning, we have specifically identified the type of event that, should it ever occur, could have the most negative impacts on our workers and our neighbors.  This is known as the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS).   As defined by EPA, we are require"

A worst-case scenario assumes a catastrophic failure that essentially results in the instantaneous release of the entire tank truck contents.  In this event, that volume is 40,000 pounds of 70% HF acid which would be released into the containment dike.  Under this scenario, the acid is assumed to evaporate and the vapors disperse in the direction of the prevailing wind.  According to EPA guidelines, exposure to HF at levels above 20 parts per million (20 part HF in a million parts of air) approximately one hour can result in serious health effects.   The worst-case scenario estimates that this level of HF concentration could reach public receptors from our site as a result of this quantity of HF being instantaneously released from the delivery tank truck.\n\nA scenario using more realistic assumptions involves the failure of a chemical hose used to transfer the 70% HF acid from our supplier's tank truck to our storage tank.  EPA defines this as the Alternative Release Scenario (ARS).  The contents of the tank truck would drain through the failed hose into a containment dike, forming a pool that would evaporate. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/ CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nGE Lighting has a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals at its Kentucky Glass Plant.  This prevention program is an integral part of working safely at GE Lighting.  The prevention program ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  Our prevention program meets all aspects of the acciden"

Some of the features in place at the Lexington GE Lighting facility to prevent a chemical accident include:\n\n\u00b7 Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n\u00b7 Secondary containment dike at the tank truck off-loading area to contain the full content of the tank truck;\n\u00b7 Secondary containment dikes around the chemical storage tanks to contain a spill;\n\u00b7 Full enclosure of the storage tanks in a separate on-site building;\n\u00b7 Operation of four fume scrubbers which serve vents located within the chemical storage and working areas;  \n\u00b7 Extensive safety information about the processes available to employees;\n\u00b7 Written operating procedures that identify plant policies on emergency response actions;\n\u00b7 Comprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistently safe work-practices;\n\u00b7 Scheduled maintenance programs to ensure equipment reliability - includes equipment testing and inspection;\n\u00b7 Compliance auditing to ensure standards are being followed;\n\u00b7 A safety procedure to review proposed plant modifications before they are implemented for possible hazards; and\n\u00b7 Safety reviews prior to startup of our processes. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Kentucky Glass Plant has an outstanding record of accident prevention, which demonstrates its commitment to public and worker safety.  Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.  \n\nThe RMP requires that all incidents involving regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impact be reported in this document.  GE Lighting has had two releases of HF acid within this 5-year history that resulted in on-site or off-site impacts as defined by EPA.  These incidents occurred in 1999.\n\nIn each case, a single employee"

      "SummaryText": "was exposed to a small amount of liquid HF acid in concentrations exceeding 50%.   The employees were treated by medical professionals for chemical burns and returned to work the next day.   In both cases, no appreciable amount of HF was released as a vapor, and there was never any danger to anyone outside the immediate area of the incident.   GE investigated both incidents, and as a result implemented specific changes to improve safety.  These included replacing chemical hoses with hard piping and reducing the concentration of acid solutions we use.  \n\nPARTICIPATION IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE \n\nThe Kentucky Glass Plant is included in the community response plan of the local fire department and its emergency response team.  Also, we are represented on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The Plant has participated and will continue to participate with these entities in mock emergency response drills at the plant in order to facilitate any future response needs.    \n\nOur most recent training exercise was held on 5/24/99, and it involved a mock HF acid release during transfer from our supplier's tank truck to our storage tank.  The exercise involved participation from GE, the county emergency management agency, the local fire department, the Lexington HAZMAT team, and our HF supplier.  This was an important step in testing our combined readiness for the unlikely event of a real emergency at our plantsite.  \n\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nGE Lighting is committed to continuously improving the overall safety and environmental performance record at the Kentucky Glass Plant.  Some of the more important modifications that we have recently made to our manufacturing operation include:\n\n\u00b7 Replacing open top mixing containers with closed top vessels to prevent accidental releases and reduce emissions;\n\u00b7 Replacing flexible chemical transfer hoses with hard piping to minimize the chance of an accidental release; and,\n\u00b7 Reducing the strength of our acid solutions to make the"
