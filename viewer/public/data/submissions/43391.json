      "SummaryText": "The City of Seguin owns and operates the Geronimo Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Guadalupe County, Texas.  The City of Seguin is aware of its' obligation under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The City of Seguin notes that there are two obligations that are required of the Seguin Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\n112(r)(1) Purpose and General Duty Clause:\nThe substance of the general duty clause is the owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has an obligation to ensure safe operation and to have a plan in the event of an accident.  The City of Seguin Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed plans to prevent and implement steps to respond to an emergency situation.\n\nRisk Management Plan:\nThe Seguin Wastewater Treatment Plant has one process that involves a chemical stored in excess of thresholds specified in 112 (r), the chlorine in the treatment process.  The Treatment Plant has been aware of the potential hazards posed by storage and use of chlorine and has established programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for emergency response in the event of a release.\n\nThe purpose of the chlorine in wastewater treatment is to disinfect the water before it is released.  Chlorine is delivered as a compressed gas and liquified gas in one-ton cylinders and there are usually two (2) one-ton drums at the plant at any given time.  For planning pupose, we have considered the impact of a sudden release of 2000 pounds of chlorine gas within a ten minute period of time.  This worst case assumption has a potential radius of impact of 3.0 miles.\n\nThe City of Seguin Wastewater Treatment Plant has implemented safety procedures to prevent and manage any chlorine releases.  Plant personnel are trained regularly on proper techniques in handling chlorine, use of safety equipment and safety procedures.  The City of Seguin Waste Treatment Plant has coordinated plans with the Seguin Fire Department and Seguin Police Department."
