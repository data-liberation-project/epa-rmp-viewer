It is our policy to adhere to the Rules and Regulations Relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Altona Volunteer Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency.  Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Knox County, Illinois LEPC and the Illinois Emergency Service & Disaster Agency (EMA) will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned,.  In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accident or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\r\n\r\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the River Valley Cooperative is Shane Schmidt.  His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document.  In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\r\n\r\nShane Schmidt, Agronomy Lead\r\nWork:      309-932-2081\r\n24-hour:   309-883-0776\r\n      \r\nAllan Coppe"

Members of the fire department and the Knox County, Illinois LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant.  In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any external portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors."

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \r\n\r\nThe system consists of two (2) storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is three (3).\r\n\r\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program, the distance to the endpoint is 3.6 miles.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\r\n\r\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves and nitrogen gas emergency shut-off valves. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediat"
