Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of KEMIRA's way of doing business. KEMIRA has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet all regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\n(b)\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nKemira's Baltimore Plant is located on the south side of the Baltimore harbor near Hawkins Point.  The plant manufactures ferric chloride using iron-bearing materials and chlorine as raw materials.  Ferric chloride is sold to customers for use as a purifying agent in water treatment processes.\r\n\r\nChlorine is a regulated substance and is received and stored at the facility in railroad tankcars.  Chlorine tankcars are piped directly to a vessel where iron-bearing materials are chlorinated to produce ferric chloride.  Other than chlorine tankcar storage and unloading, there is very little handling of chlorine at the facility.  The worst case and alternate case scenarios for a chlorine release from the facility involve a release from a chlorine tankcar.\r\n\r\n(c)\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nKemira's Baltimore Plant takes a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals. A management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described in the sections below.  This prevention program has been implemented for the ferric chloride process.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore Plant maintains technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at the facility.  Chemical information is documented within Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).  MSDSs contain toxicity information, physical data, reactivity data,"

      "SummaryText": "corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazards effects of mixing substances together.  MSDSs are available to all employees as well as external emergency responders.  Information concerning the technology of the process and the equipment is documented and maintained in engineering design documents.  Technology information includes block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, process chemistry, maximum intended inventories, safe operating limits and consequences of deviation.  Equipment information includes materials of construction, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical classification, relief system design, design codes and standards used, material and energy balances, and safety systems.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore plant uses the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) methodology to prepare PHAs.  A team comprising personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examine each section of the process to identify potential process deviations, consequences and hazards. The analysis also examines previous incidents, facility siting and human factors.  The team then compares identified hazards to the existing set of engineering and administrative controls, and makes recommendations to further mitigate hazards where appropriate.  These recommendations are prioritized by management and tracked until they are implemented.  PHAs are updated and revalidated every five years and whenever a significant process change is made.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nPlant management and operators work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of the facility. These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as process startup, normal operation, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown. Operating procedures are used as a reference by employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting oper"

Operating procedures are reviewed every year to ensure that they are current and accurate.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks. Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes a general overview of the process, properties of substances used in the process and their associated hazards, and a detailed review of the operating procedures for the process.  Only after they have demonstrated their understanding of this information are they allowed to work independently.  Employees receive refresher training at least every three years.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore plant maintains the mechanical integrity of critical equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment.  An inspection and testing program helps to identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails.  If a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem. The mechanical integrity system includes inspection and testing procedures, specifications for replacement equipment, safe work practices, and training of maintenance personnel in mechanical integrity procedures.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\n\r\nProcess changes are reviewed to determine if new hazards will be introduced or existing prevention measures will be compromised.  Except for replacements-in-kind, all changes are subjected to a hazard review to ensure that new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, operators in the process are trained in the change, and all process safety documentation is updated.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\r\n\r\nWhenever a process change occurs that requires an update of the process safety information, a pre-sta"
