Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 110,500 pounds in the facility's one (1) tank.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 110,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 % as limited by design standards and company procedures. the distance to the endpoint of dispersion of 200 parts per million (ppm) based on the model used is 2.43 miles.\n\nhe alternate case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose with 26,600 pounds over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion of 200 ppm is 1.56 miles.\n\nThe facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. These regulations are consistent with the IA Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship Code and with ANSI K61.6 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111.\n\nThere have bee no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site nor to our knowledge have any accidental releases resulted in off"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
