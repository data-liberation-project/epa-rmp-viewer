Plains management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Tirzah Terminal is owned by Plains Marketing Canada, L.P. and operated by Plains LPG Services, L.P.  At the terminal, propane is received via pipeline and stored in pressure tanks or underground storage caverns.  Propane is loaded into transport trucks from the above ground tanks only.  Propane and Ethly mercaptan are the only substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Tirzah Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of the high standards striven for by Plains.  These high standards include:\n\n\n\nA? Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\nA? Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\nA? Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with"

Correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the terminal.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Tirzah Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since Plains purchased the terminal.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane or ethyl mercaptan release has occurred at the Tirzah Terminal since Plains purchased the terminal. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which is coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the York Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the York County Sheriff's Office, South Carlonia State Policy, County Emergency Services and the South Carlonia Department of Environmental Quality.  The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response.  The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.

Compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the terminal is periodically being evaluated for improvements.\n\nA? An ongoing dialogue with the York Fire Department will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops."
