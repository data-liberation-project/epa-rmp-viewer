The safe, reliable operation of our ammonia refrigerant is a top business imperative for the company. Ziegenfelder has and will continue to invest in the needed resources to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia. This includes the investment in top talent; early detection, alarms, and automated shut-down devices; preventive maintenance; emergency response and preparedness; and, the training and development of employees to repair and maintain our covered process. \r\n\r\nZiegenfelder's overarching Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) program is designed to reduce risk and drive improvement using the core principles of ISO 14001 and ISO 45001. This includes annual risk assessments, safe work procedures, training, emergency response plan, auditing, and monthly executive management reviews. In addition to common face to face communication platforms, the company leverages technology and social media to engage and empower the ~350 employees nationwide. Employees have a voice and the ability to raise issues through a phone application (VelocityEHS). The frontline leaders have the ability to enter work orders and help prioritize them through a computerized maintenance system (HIPPO).  Mobile equipment is equipped with InfoLink technology which ensures every lift is inspected before use while providing real-time driver behavior indicators such as speed, hard brake, and impacts. All of these procedures, processes and tools allow Ziegenfelder to develop corrective and preventative actions which specifically aid in the prevention of workforce injuries, ammonia releases, damaged equipment or products.  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to ammonia leaks, any odor of ammonia, mus"

If ammonia has been detected or reported leaking, only members of the Special Maintenance Ammonia Response Tribe (SMART) are able to respond to the leak. The SMART members are trained and provided the needed protective gear and monitoring devices.\r\n\r\nThe company's senior leaders are ultimately accountable for the ongoing management of the process safety management (PSM) program, which is specifically designed to meet regulatory and best practices to ensure the safe use of ammonia in our business. These senior leaders include: Director of EHS; Vice President of Operations; Vice President of Engineering and Maintenance; and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Ziegenfelder has developed a Responsible, Accountable, Communication, and Informed (RACI) matrix to further ensure clarity across departments and positions. \r\n\r\nB.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nZiegenfelder Wheeling, West Virginia manufactures flavored frozen ice treats and utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system. The facility stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of the threshold quantity outlined in \u00a768.10(a), and therefore is subject to the EPA's Risk Management Planning Rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard. Ziegenfelder uses ammonia in a closed-loop refrigeration system. This system provides the operating processes for the main refrigeration system, which provides cooling for spaces; processing equipment; and frozen storage of finished product. Ammonia is the only regulated substances utilized at the facility.\r\n\r\nC.\tDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with EPA's RMP regulations and OSHA PSM.

Procedures related to maintenance activities and non-routine tasks were modified following this incident. In addition, upgrades were made to the mitigation system.\r\nThe Wheeling facility was not regulated by RMP at the time of this release because onsite storage was below 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nE.\tDescription of the Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Wheeling facility.
