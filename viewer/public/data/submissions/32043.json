      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe, at the West Knox Utility District, are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and audits associated with the chlorination system at the water treatment plant.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  The utility is coordinated with the Rural Metro Fire Department, which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to respond to a release of chlorine, and is currently included in the Knox County Emergency Management Agency emergency response plan.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at our water treatment plant.  Chlorine is used for disinfection in the production of potable water.  Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure.  The vapor pressure of stored chlorine is 6.8 atmospheres (99.89 pounds per square inch).  Chlorine gas is non-flammable, but it is a strong oxidizer that can support combustion of other materials.  Chlorine is a toxic gas that is considered by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to be immediately dangerous to life and health at concentrations exceeding 10 parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our plant is 14,000 pounds (lbs) or seven one-ton containers.  The one-ton container is the largest chlorine storage vessel on-site and all of the containers are located in the container storage room, which is of fire-resistant construction in accordance with the Chlorine Institute specification for chlorine storage facilities.  The chlorination system is a vacuum feed system with safety features such as automatic shutoff during loss of vacuum, chlorine gas detec"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe chlorination system must meet Program 3 prevention program requirements, as the covered process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under the Tennessee OSHA program.  The following sections briefly review and update the elements of the Program 3 prevention program.  In the past five years, our water treatment plant has taken all the necessary steps to address the requirements of each element of the program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nOur operating staff at the water treatment plant ensures the process safety information that describes the chemical properties and chemical hazards, operating parameters, and process equipment associated with the chlorination system is accurate and complete.  Process safety information was last reviewed on March 3, 2003.  There has been no major change to the chlorination storage and feed system in the last five years.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur utility district uses a team familiar with the plant?s chlorination system and the PHA technique to review the hazards of the process and to review the adequacy of the safeguards in place.  The team?s recommendations, resolutions, and corrective actions are addressed in a timely manner.  The last PHA was conducted on March 3, 2003.  Recommendations from the PHA will be completed by December 30, 2005.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, written operating procedures are in place, regularly reviewed, updated to reflect changes, and accessible to the operating staff.  The most recent review/revision of the operating procedures for the chlorination system was conducted on March 3, 2003.\n\nTraining\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that the operating staff is competent to operate the plant?s chlorination system.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more f"

The training program was last reviewed/ revised on April 1, 2004.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPreventative maintenance, inspection, and testing of the chlorination equipment are critical to the mechanical integrity of the system and its safe operation.  Written inspection/preventative maintenance procedures for the chlorination equipment are used at the plant.  The preventative maintenance procedures/schedule were reviewed/revised on March 3, 2003.  Equipment inspections/testing are conducted monthly, when the containers are changed.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe West Knox Utility District has in place an incident investigation procedure that calls for the investigation of each incident which results in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine from its facilities.  An investigation is initiated as promptly as possible by an incident investigation team, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  Incident investigations have not been required in the last five years.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe West Knox Utility District selects a team to conduct audits of the risk management program, to determine whether the elements of the program are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any recommended corrective actions are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  The most recent self-audit was conducted on June 3, 2002.  Changes recommended by the audit team will be completed by December 2005.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the water treatment plant to safely manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures of the chlorination system.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a change to the chlorination system are promptly informed of the change and offered training on the change before startup.

The last review/revision of the management of change procedure was March 3, 2003.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews are required for major changes to the chlorination system.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment meet design specifications and operations and maintenance procedures are in place for the safe startup and operation of the system.  The most recent review/revision of the pre-start-up procedure for the chlorination system was on March 3, 2003.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the West Knox Utility District hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities with the or near the area of the chlorination system.  The West Knox Utility District has a procedure in place to inform contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor?s work and the covered process.  The most recent review/revision to the contractor safety procedures was conducted on March 3, 2003.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe West Knox Utility District believes that successful implementation of the risk management program is a team effort.  All plant employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to make recommendations.  A job responsibility of the operating staff is to implement the risk management program; the operating staff has access to all the information created for the program.  The most recent review/revision of the employee participation plan was conducted on March 3, 2003.\n\nHot Work Permits\nA hot work procedure is in place at the water treatment plant.  Whenever hot work (welding, cutting, etc.) is performed at the plant, the hot work procedure must be followed and a hot work certificate must be issued.  This applies to work performed by the operating staff and to outside contractors.  The most recent review/revision of the hot work permit procedure plan was conducted on March 3, 2003.\n\n4.  Five-"

There have been no reportable accidental releases during this period.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\nThe water treatment plant has in place a written emergency plan to deal with various emergency situations.  This plan is supplemented by an emergency response procedure specifically for minor chlorine releases.  To ensure proper response during an emergency, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require a modified emergency response.  The Rural Metro Fire Department will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to respond to any catastrophic release of chlorine that may have offsite consequences.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nFuture safety improvements include additional training, public education, and coordination with emergency responders."
