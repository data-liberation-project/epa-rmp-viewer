A committee consisting of various technical personnel reviews  and approves all MOC requests. The completion of all action items is tracked and documented via an electronic database.\n\nAnnual and tri - annual compliance audits are coordinated by the PQC Manager.

The completion of recommendations is tracked and documented via an electronic database.\n\nThe Incident Investigation Program  consists of a detailed procedure incoporated in the Safety Procedures Manual. All regulated chemical releases are investigated by the area supervisor by forming an incident investigation team  and issued as preliminary reports to a committee. The committee reviews the reports to ensure that root causes have been identified and suitable corrective actions have been proposed. The Safety and Training Manager then issues a final incident investigation report by incorporating information and feed back from all sources and reviews. The final reports are distributed to all supervisory personnel, who in turn discuss these with their employees in their safety contacts.

Mitigation systems used are dikes, sumps, sprinkler systems, deluge systems, water curtains, hazmat foam system, fire fighting foam systems, mineral oil dump systems, neutralization and fire water containment system. Most of process areas are monitored by leak detection and alarms systems for toxic and flammable leaks.Operator refresher training is conducted on prescribed basis of the operator training program. The preventive maintenance program conducts inspections and tests to assure operation of preventive devices. Management of Change procedure assures that all changes are reviewed for their hazards before implementation. All incidents are investigated to determine the root cause and corrective actions are implemented to prevent future incidents.\n\nThe site had no reportable accident during last five years.\n\nThe site emergency response program meets the requirements of the EPA Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance. The plan defines the response organization, coordination with local emergency response committee, equipment, response procedures, training, notification procedures, and drills. The plan is updated according to the recommendations from the system deficiencies uncovered by the periodic drills and the incident reports.\n\nRecently Basell USA Inc. purchased the entire site from Akzo Nobel Polymer Chemicals LLC and then sold a part of the regulated processes to Grace Davison.
