Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAs stated in the Corporate Health, Safety, and Environmental Policy and Principles, Hexion Specialty Chemical, Inc. is committed to health, safety, and environmental excellence.  To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Hexion Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis plant makes formaldehyde solutions, phenol-formaldehyde resins and urea-formaldehyde resins.  The site includes one formaldehyde manufacturing unit and two resin reactors.  Although we sell some formaldehyde, it is primarily used on site as a raw material for resins.\n\nThe regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\n\nFormaldehyde solution 1,160,000 lbs.\n\n3. Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations.  A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance.  This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system"

      "SummaryText": "to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly Safety Committee meeting, where a management control checksheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule.  The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for this program.\n\nDesignated personnel are assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units.  Their duties include keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit.  All employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nDesignated personnel maintain an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program.  Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference.  By applying the information it contains their actions will prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release. Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action items database to track the items to completion. \n\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents.  For equipment and procedure changes, a Change Worksheet initiates a safety review.  This review may include process hazard analysis.  Changes to product formulations initiate a review by a technical and plant personnel.  \n\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  A computer database is used to manage the preventive maintenance schedule.  Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed.  The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment f"

      "SummaryText": "ailure.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices, which prevent accidental releases.  One important section describes safety measures for welding or other \"hot\" work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire.  The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance.  These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\n\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence.  These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.\n\nInternal Corporate Health, Safety and Environmental Audits are conducted periodically to maintain compliance with local, state and federal regulations.  Regional Environmental, Health and Safety professionals periodically review the programs as well.  Addressing recommendations from these audits and reviews keeps the safety program effective.\n\n4. Five-year accident history\n\nIn the five-year period from June 17, 2004 through June 17, 2009 there were no off-site releases of regulated substances.\n\n5.  Emergency response program\n\nThe plant Emergency Response Plan describes procedures for actual and threatened releases, including coordination with fire department responders.  An emergency response drill is conducted annually to test the Emergency Response Plan and reinforce training that plant responders receive.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNo significant changes are planned."
