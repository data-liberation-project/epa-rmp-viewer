The management and employees of Effingham Clay Service Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment 2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers Anhydrous ammonia is received,  stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be120,000 pounds 3. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes The maximum quantity release would be120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint of 14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1 mile. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary. 4. The accident release prevention program. This facility complies with EPA 's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implimented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". 5. Five year accident history. There have been  no accidental rele"

The emergency response program. The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;  Provided State and local authorities the emergency planning and community right - to - know information as required under SARA Title III ( EPCRA); A written emergency response plan,  in accordance with OSHA standard , 29 CFR 1910.120 , inclluding pre-emergency planning and employee training. 7. Planned changes to improve safety. Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
