The facility is located on federal land in the Sam Houston National Forest.  The primary operations at the facility include natural gas liquids separation, dehydration and compression.  RMP regulations apply to all facilities that have certain chemicals in amounts exceediing a threshold quantity.\n\nThe applicable chemicals at CCC are: Natural Gas Liquids (Flammable -NPFA rating of 4) \n Natural Gas Liquids consists primarily of \n Ethane(flammable), \n Propane(flammable) \n Butane(flammable) \n Pentane(flammable).  \n\nThe facility is located in an unoccupied area.  It is monitored regularly by trained operators and maintenance personnel.  There is periodic inspection of the site by Forest Service Rangers.  The system is monitored continuously by compressor monitors and shutdown instrumentation.  In the event the system shuts down, an automatic call is placed to an operator who responds immediately.\n\nAll operations personnel have had formal training in operations, safety and emergency response procedures at the facility.  Emergency shut-down devices and manual valves can be used at any time to completely isolate the facility.  Product is picked up regularly by truck using DOT approved drivers and equipment. \n\nThere is spill containment around the facility storage tanks.  Unloading stations are protected by remote isolation valves and excess flow valves.  The process is isolated from the product receiver by manual shut-off valve. \n\nEmergnecy Response would be performed by the local fire department and the San Jacinto County Emergency Management Office for backup.\n\nVisual and Operations Inspection is performed daily by operators.  Maintenance inspections on compressor systems is performed monthly."
