Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility for processing and to provide cooling for storage rooms. Our refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range from 15\" of vacuum on the low side to a high side pressure of 210psi in our south engine room identified as ER1. While normal operations range from 10psi on the low side to a high side pressure of 210 psi in our north engine room identified as ER2. The maximum amount of ammonia in the system at any one time is estimated at 12,928 pounds.\r\n\r\nWorst case release scenario for a toxic substance:\r\nAlternative Release Scenario for a toxic substance:\r\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nBrakebush Wells has established an in house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle the release of anhydrous ammonia. The established steps include initial training under OSHA Regulation 20 DFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual refresher training for all personnel that are on the Hazmat team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all personnel are prepared in the event of an emergency. These established plans and procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure that they are current and up to date.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nBrakebush Wells has trained selected personnel, including refrigeration operators in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response, OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine the appropriate level of response to initiate. This could be by dimply tightening a flange bolt or packing gland, or initiating a system shut down. Brakebush Wells has established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system and has included in those procedures the emergency shut down and isolation in the event of a"
