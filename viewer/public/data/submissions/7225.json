      "SummaryText": "1.  Facility Accidental Relase Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of Actagro, LLC (the facility) at 4516 N. Howard, Biola, California are committed to the prevention of any accidental relase of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage, blending, and sale of liquid fertilizers.\n- Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n- Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in one above ground tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled to 12,000 gallons or approximately 61,800 pounds.\n\n3.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the storage tank that when filled to its greatest amount, would release 12,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.10 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the five year accident history (or most likely potential incident) is a release from a 1.5 inch line.  The distance to the end point of dispersion to 200 ppm is .48 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Facility has implemented the provisions of the Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling jof Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health A"

Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental relases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, propery damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations: OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38; OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and Section 25503, Division 6.95 fo the California Health and Safety Code.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance jof safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia process at the facility at this time."
