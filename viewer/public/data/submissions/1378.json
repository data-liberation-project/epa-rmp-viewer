Solvents are removed by drying, captured using a dual-bed carbon adsorption system, reclaimed using low pressure steam stripping, and are reused on-site following distillation. Thermoplastic resin manufacturing involves controlled reaction of monomers to produce low melt point copolymers of styrene/butadiene (808) or styrene/methacrylate (707).  Both products are manufactured using water suspension reactions, followed by water removal, air drying, and packaging. XP-454 is a conductive resin which is used as an ingredient in photocopier developer production. In the first process step, a carbon black flushing process occurs using solution polymerization.  Waste toluene and methanol are internally recovered and reused as part of the process. Reactive Extrusion (REX) Resin is a cross-linked polyester type resin produced by melt mixing in an extruder, followed by cooling, crushing and packaging. Binder tape manufacturing involves application of glue to foil backed paper, followed by sizing and packaging operations. These operations are supported by Facilities Engineering which provides:\n7 Facilities maintenance,\n7 Steam generation and distribution,\n7 Tower water generation and distribution,\n7 Electrical power distribution,\n7 Housekeeping services,\n7 Communications systems, \n7 Environment, Health, & Safety Support ,\n7 Groundwater remediation system operation and maintenance,\n7 Emergency response systems,\n7 Compressed air generation and distribution, and \n7 Chilled water generation and distribution.\n Additionally, the Site is supported by the Production Control (PC) organization which provides:\n7 Materials shipping and receiving;\n7 Internal transfers of raw materials, in-process materials, wastes, and products; and\n7 Warehousing.\n\nOn a mass basis, the major raw materials used at Xerox/OKC include:\n7 Methylene Chloride\n7 Tolu"
