Newbern, aka Jimmy Dean Foods (JDF), submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Newbern, Tennessee facility. The Sara Lee Foods ? Newbern (JDF) operations include the manufacturing of pork sausage for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand name of Jimmy Dean Sausage.  JDF has been in operation at this facility for over fifteen years providing quality meat products and over 800 jobs to the local community.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nJDF is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is JDF?s policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nJDF is subject to 112? because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.  JDF is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  JDF uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112? regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 275,000 ft2 facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants.  JDF?s refrigeration system consists of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping, which can contain an amount in excess of 10"

      "SummaryText": ",000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nWorst Case / Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, Sara Lee Foods - Newbern evaluated off-site consequences for releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Both a worst case scenario and an alternate case scenario were developed.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, JDF has implemented several precautionary measures.\n\n\n\nJDF has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-off), ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding.  In addition, JDF has trained personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (Hazardous-Materials team).\n\n\n\nJDF has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed at a frequency sufficient to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in the process chemicals, technology, and equipment, and changes to the facility.  JDF encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company memoranda and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by JDF, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employ"

      "SummaryText": "ees.\n\n\n\nJDF understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore JDF has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using log sheets to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  These log sheets are maintained in the Refrigeration office for three years.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components, equipment tests are performed.  Specifically, the equipment is tested to detect corrosion.  This equipment consists of pressure vessels, headers, and piping.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that JDF?s control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\n\n\n\n* In accordance with the PSM program, JDF conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years.  Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\n\n\n* In addition, JDF is audited by the local fire department on an annual basis.\n\n\n\n* The USDA maintains a daily presence for monitoring the JDF facility.\n\n\n\n* JDF?s insurance carrier also conducts independent audits on an annual basis.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOver the last five years, JDF has not experienced an accidental off-site release of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nJDF has documented emergency response procedures in a document entitled Emergency Planning & Response Action Plan (EPRA Plan) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.

      "SummaryText": "luded in the EPRA Plan are measures to be taken internally by JDF as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n\n\n\nJDF has trained on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases.  These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  These personnel receive initial training and annual update training thereafter.\n\n\n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with JDF?s emergency response procedures, JDF will provide copies of the EPRA Plan and future major revisions for review and approval by the local agencies.  The following local agencies are included for EPRA Plan review and approval:\n\n\n\n* Newbern Fire Department\n\n* Newbern Police Department\n\n* Dyer County Emergency Planning Committee\n\n\n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, JDF?s EPRA Plan includes procedures/ equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned using police and fire vehicles equipped with public address systems.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration is a mature industry employing known technology.  Yet, the plant remains abreast of current innovations that improve safety.  To this end, the Sara Lee Corporation is an active member of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the Refrigeration Engineers Training Association (RETA).  This involvement enables the facility to learn and implement the most modern safety system improvements as they emerge within the ammonia refrigeration industry.  Recently upgraded computer maintenance management systems enhance reliable operation of the RMP covered process. Some of the most recent planned im"
