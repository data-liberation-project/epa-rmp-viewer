      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nGeorgia Gulf Chemicals and Vinyls, LLC Aberdeen PVC plant has a long history of safe operation in the Aberdeen community.  Our employees work hard every hour, every day to provide a safe workplace for themselves while protecting the environment inside and outside our fences.  \n\nPLANT INFORMATION\nThe Aberdeen plant produces polyvinyl chloride (PVC or vinyl) resins and compounds.  These materials are used by our customers to produce wire and cable insulation, vinyl siding, pipe and packaging to name a few.  We produce the resins and compounds by polymerizing vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).   After the polymerization, the resin is dried and stored for shipping.  Most of the VCM we consume comes from Georgia Gulf's operations in Louisiana by rail.  The VCM is a gas at normal conditions, but is kept under pressure and handled as a liquid much the way propane gas is handled.  At certain concentrations, the VCM is flammable and we have many safety systems in place to deal with this hazard.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\nIn calculating the \u0013worst-case\u0014 scenario, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), requires the following assumptions be made:\nCatastrophic (complete) failure of the largest storage vessel\nComplete loss of the contents of the vessel and vaporization of the liquid in ten minutes\nMixing of sufficient air with the vapors to generate an explosion with a 10 per cent yield-the worst seen for mixtures of flammable vapors with air\nNone of the plant\u0012s procedures or emergency systems work\nIgnition of the vapor cloud as soon as all the material vaporizes\n\nThe impact from these \u0013worst-case\u0014 events decreases as you move away from the facility.  It is important to understand the standard measure of impact for determining the impacted zones.  These limits are developed by the EPA and are used in the \u0013alternate case\u0014 scenarios as well.  For flammable releases, the company is required to define the impacted areas within which one could see a shock wave of 1 pound"

      "SummaryText": "per square inch (psi) overpressure.  A 1 psi overpressure can cause damage such as shattering of windows and partial demolition of houses.\n\nThe possibility of a \u0013worst-case\u0014 scenario happening is extremely remote and is of limited value for planning purposes.  This scenario defines the largest possible impacted zone.\n\nVCM is unloaded from railcars and is stored in a spherical tank.  The capacity of this vessel is 6 million pounds of VCM.  If the vessel was completely full, ruptures, none of our safety systems worked, it was a hot day and all the liquid vaporized in ten minutes, the wind mixed in just enough air without dispersing the vapor cloud, just then a spark set off an explosion and the maximum explosive yield was generated, the off-site area impacted would include the area in a 1.1 mile circle around this vessel.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\nOther release scenarios are also required to be considered.  These \u0013alternate-case\u0014 scenarios generally involve smaller releases and safety systems can be considered in determining the extent of the impact.  For the Aberdeen Plant\u0012s \u0013alternate-case\u0014, it was assumed that 8-inch piping was broken from a vinyl chloride storage vessel in the production unit releasing 486,000 of vinyl chloride in 12 minutes.  It is assumed that the plant\u0012s gas detection system detects the release and sets off the plant\u0012s firewater system.  This will \u0013knock-down\u0014 half the vapor.  For this scenario, impact is limited to a 0.2 mile circle around the vessel with no off-site impact.\n\nGeorgia Gulf Chemicals and Vinyls, LLC Aberdeen plant is proud of the fact that we have never experienced any release resulting in damage to our neighbors.  With our safety systems and employees working every hour, every day to prevent chemical accidents, we are confident of extending this record of safe operation.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION\nAccident prevention is a large part of everyone\u0012s job at the Aberdeen Plant.  We work hard to make sure that our systems, procedures and"

To accomplish this goal, our emergency preparedness efforts focus on four areas:\n\nPersonnel-The most important part of any response plan is well trained, qualified people.  At Georgia Gulf, we have a voluntary Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The team is made up of employees from various departments within the plant.  They train regularly at Texas A&M\u0012s school for firefighters and the Mississippi State Fire Academy.  On-site drills are conducted to test and refine response plans.  The ERT members have specialized training in hazardous materials, confined-space rescue and medical training.\n\nResources-The proper equipment is a necessary requirement for any job.  In the field of emergency response, it is necessary that equipment, materials and labor be available immediately as neede"

The equipment includes chemical transportation response equipment, automatically activated fire water systems, movable fire water monitors, firefighting gear, fire extinguishers and other necessary equipment.\n\nAlthough we don\u0012t expect it to happen, Georgia Gulf Chemicals and Vinyls, LLC has provided sirens to alert the community to off-site emergencies.  These sirens are located in the community and are controlled by the Aberdeen Police Department.  The community may use them in case of severe weather, chemical accidents or any situation requiring action.\n\nPlanning-Complete plans are a must to help guide people and resources in the event of an emergency.  Georgia Gulf Chemicals and Vinyls, LLC has plans in place to handle on-site and off-site incidents.  Our plans have been developed in coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\nAlliances-To provide for additional resources in the event of a major incident, the Aberdeen plant has agreements with the Aberdeen Fire Department and local emergency medical responders to provide additional resources if requested.  These potential responders are given tours of the plant and are familiarized with processes at the plant in the event they are called on to provide assistance."
