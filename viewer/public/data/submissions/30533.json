      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION TO RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMP) REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAkzo Nobel Chemicals produces a variety of products at our Pasadena, Texas facility - inorganic catalyst products for the petroleum industry, organic monomers for the lens manufacturing industry, and organic peroxides for the plastic manufacturing industry.  Three of our organic chemical manufacturing processes use regulated chemicals above the RMP applicability threshold.  The organic monomer manufacturing process contains a diked allyl alcohol bulk storage tank (RMP toxic chemical).  One of our organic peroxide manufacturing processes contains a diked 2-methyl-1-butene bulk storage tank (RMP flammable chemical), while another one of our organic peroxide manufacturing processes utilizes a refrigerated building for drum storage of isopropyl chloroformate (RMP toxic chemical).\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSenior management within Akzo Nobel is very committed to chemical, employee, and plant safety at our facility.  Their commitment is demonstrated by:\n\n     *   maintaining a staff of safety professionals onsite to properly manage all aspects of safety;\n     *   implementation of the Chemical Manufacturing Association's Responsible Care Initiative, which\n             requires member facilities to implement several different management codes of practices that\n             address various aspects of pollution prevention and process safety management;\n     *   annual reviews by senior management to verify the implementation and execution of CMA's\n             Responsible Care Initiative; \n     *   availability of corporate health & safety professionals for consultations;\n     *   encouraging active participation in both the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the\n             the Channel Industry Mutual Aid (CIMA) Emergency Response Association, which is the local\n             emergency response association that would respond to an emergency at our facility; a"

Both management systems allow for safety and environmental reviews to be performed before any requested process change can be made at our facility.\n\nAkzo Nobel will also be undergoing a voluntary safety inspection by OSHA on June 28, 1999 to determine whether our existing safety programs meets all of OSHA's Voluntary Protection Plan (VPP) program requirements.  This is a voluntary program that Akzo Nobel has undertaken to ensure that our facility's existing safety program meets or exceeds all of OSHA's safety requirements.  Once accepted into OSHA's program, the site will undergo periodic inspections by OSHA to ensure the continuation of our safety efforts.  Volunteering for OSHA's VPP program is yet another example of how the site has made a commitment in ensuring the highest degree of chemical, employee, and plant safety.   \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SUMMARY\n\nThe offsite consequences associated with both the worst case and alternate release scenarios have been removed from the Executive Summary pursuant to April 9, 2004 Federal Register.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAkzo Nobel Chemicals has not had any accidental releases of either allyl alcohol, 2-mehtyl-1-butene, or isopropyl chloroformate which required any of our employees to seek medical attention or resulted in any off-site impacts to be experienced.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAkzo Nobel Chemicals is subject to various Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) emergency response program regulations.

Akzo Nobel is a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) Association, and participates in an annual drill involving member CIMA companies.  Our site also undergoes periodic site inspections by CIMA to ensure our overall level of emergency response readiness.\n\nShould an emergency event ever occur onsite, the public would be informed of the event by a representative of Akzo Nobel Chemicals placing a recorded message on the local Community Awareness Emergency Response line (281-476-CAER or 281-476-2237).  The person with overall responsibility for coordinating our response to an onsite emergency (Incident Commander) has the responsibility of ensuring that all agency and community notifications are promptly made."
