The refinery processes foreign and domestic crude oil for the production of Heavy Olefin Feed, which is subsequently shipped to and converted at other Shell sites to ethylene, propylene and butadiene.  A range of other fuel products such as liquid petroleum gases, gasoline and kerosene are also produced at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe facility's risk management program and maximum chemical inventory were evaluated and  it was determined that the facility's processess render the facility subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements.  Moreover, the processess render the facility subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR 1910.119.  As such, the terminal is subject to RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.  \n\n\n\nShell maintains a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs, and work practices that are related to the RMP Prevention Program elements.  These policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, and are designed to further enhance the facility's existing safety programs and procedures.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nShell views the health and safety of its employees and the communitity in which it operates as its top priority.  The Shell facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.  Refer to Section 7 of this RMP submission for a detailed discussion of the facility's OSHA PSM program.\n\n\n\nRMP FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAt the time of this RMP sub"

      "SummaryText": "mission, there are no RMP-related accidents to be reported since no accidental releases of any RMP covered substances held above their threshold quantity in a covered process resulted in death, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage were identified for the Shell Chemical - Mobile Site for the last five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Mobile Site maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including incident command, proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Mobile Site has developed procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes or other facility areas.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Mobile Site is coordinated with the Mobile County, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. "

      "SummaryText": " The Mobile Site has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility's plan covers topics such as responding to a potential release, fire, explosion, or chemical release.   Procedures and practices related to the maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment are also in place.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties. \n\n\n\nTypes of RMP site specific prevention steps include the following:\n\n-Release detection (e.g., process alarms, operator surveillance, portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment);\n\n-Release containment and control (e.g.,relief systems, dikes to contain liquid releases, back-up equipment, control valves); and\n\n-Release Mitigation (e.g., area firewater monitors, emergency response equipment, trained emergency response personnel).\n\n\n\n"
