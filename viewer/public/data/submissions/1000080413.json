              "Description": "Shell Chemical LP - Mobile Site (\"refinery\" or \"facility\")views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.  The Shell facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.  The following sections will provide an overview of the various elements of the facility's PSM program.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe cornerstone of the PSM program is Process Safety Information (PSI). Process Safety Information defines the chemical hazards, equipment, and technology in a given process.  Maintaining the PSI enables Shell employees involved in operating the covered processes to identify and understand the hazards posed by such processes involving OSHA PSM Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment conditions, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS  \n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  Typically, the Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methodology is used to conduct process unit PHAs.  This technique may be supplemented using the ?What If?, ?Checklist? or ?What If/Checklist? techniques.  PHA team members include operations, tank farm, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed.  PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved and process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use.  PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.   \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3)temporary operations, (4) emergency operations,(5) emergency shutdowns, (6) normal shutdowns, and (7)startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shell has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. The operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The training includes an emphasis on unit specific safety and health hazards and emergency operations including shutdown.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training.  Records for refresher and classroom training should be maintained onsite and include the employee?s name, date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training. \n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe facility has well-established procedures and practices to maintain pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps, and critical instrument systems are in a safe operating condition.  The mechanical integrity program includes ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment, and quality assurance practices, as applicable, to verify their suitability for the process application for which they will be used.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to its processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and other facility changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure the (1) technical basis of the proposed change,(2)impact of the change on process related safety and health, (3) modifications to operating procedures, and (4) necessary time period for the change.  In addition, the procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\n \n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new process or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, such as, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the facility will periodically conduct a compliance audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are required to be evaluated at least once every three years, with the RMP Compliance audit teams findings developed in a report.  The compliance audit report is required to be reviewed to determine and document resolution of the audit team?s findings.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are required to be retained.  \n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS\n\n\n\nShell investigates all RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  The investigation team's recommendations are required to be tracked to resolution and documented.  The RMP incident investigation results are required to be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.  \n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include the site health and safety committee, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and management of change activities.  Employees have access to all information generated from the facility's accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\nThe facility has a hot work permit procedure in place for all work performed at or near covered process areas.  The intent of the hot work permit is to ensure that appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is being utilized before the work begins.  The permit must document that the OSHA fire prevention and/or chemical protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations.  The permit should specify the dates on which the work is authorized and identify the specific process/equipment on which hot work is to be performed.  All permits should be kept on file until the workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe facility uses a contractor safety program that includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator.  Before selecting contractors to perform any work on or near covered process areas, the safety performance of the contractor and contractor safety programs should be evaluated.  Verification that the contractor is fulfilling his or her responsibilities and is abiding to all relevant safety programs and procedures should be maintained before, and throughout, all work in or near covered process areas by responsible facility personnel.  Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nThe Mobile Site maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including incident command, proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Mobile Site has developed procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes or other facility areas.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Mobile Site is coordinated with the Mobile County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Mobile Site has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility's plan covers topics such as responding to a potential release, fire, explosion, or chemical release.   Procedures and practices related to the maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment are also in place.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties. \n\n\n\nTypes of RMP site specific prevention steps include the following:\n\n-Release detection (e.g., process alarms, operator surveillance, portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment);\n\n-Release containment and control (e.g.,relief systems, dikes to contain liquid releases, back-up equipment, control valves); and\n\n-Release Mitigation (e.g., area firewater monitors, emergency response equipment, trained emergency response personnel).\n\n ",

              "Description": "Shell Chemical LP - Mobile Site (\"refinery\" or \"facility\")views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.  The Shell facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.  The following sections will provide an overview of the various elements of the facility's PSM program.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe cornerstone of the PSM program is Process Safety Information (PSI). Process Safety Information defines the chemical hazards, equipment, and technology in a given process.  Maintaining the PSI enables Shell employees involved in operating the covered processes to identify and understand the hazards posed by such processes involving OSHA PSM Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment conditions, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS  \n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  Typically, the Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methodology is used to conduct process unit PHAs.  This technique may be supplemented using the ?What If?, ?Checklist? or ?What If/Checklist? techniques.  PHA team members include operations, tank farm, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed.  PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved and process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use.  PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.   \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3)temporary operations, (4) emergency operations,(5) emergency shutdowns, (6) normal shutdowns, and (7)startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shell has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. The operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The training includes an emphasis on unit specific safety and health hazards and emergency operations including shutdown.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training.  Records for refresher and classroom training should be maintained onsite and include the employee?s name, date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training. \n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe facility has well-established procedures and practices to maintain pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps, and critical instrument systems are in a safe operating condition.  The mechanical integrity program includes ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment, and quality assurance practices, as applicable, to verify their suitability for the process application for which they will be used.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to its processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and other facility changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure the (1) technical basis of the proposed change,(2)impact of the change on process related safety and health, (3) modifications to operating procedures, and (4) necessary time period for the change.  In addition, the procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\n \n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new process or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, such as, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the facility will periodically conduct a compliance audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are required to be evaluated at least once every three years, with the RMP Compliance audit teams findings developed in a report.  The compliance audit report is required to be reviewed to determine and document resolution of the audit team?s findings.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are required to be retained.  \n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS\n\n\n\nShell investigates all RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  The investigation team's recommendations are required to be tracked to resolution and documented.  The RMP incident investigation results are required to be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.  \n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include the site health and safety committee, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and management of change activities.  Employees have access to all information generated from the facility's accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\nThe facility has a hot work permit procedure in place for all work performed at or near covered process areas.  The intent of the hot work permit is to ensure that appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is being utilized before the work begins.  The permit must document that the OSHA fire prevention and/or chemical protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations.  The permit should specify the dates on which the work is authorized and identify the specific process/equipment on which hot work is to be performed.  All permits should be kept on file until the workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe facility uses a contractor safety program that includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator.  Before selecting contractors to perform any work on or near covered process areas, the safety performance of the contractor and contractor safety programs should be evaluated.  Verification that the contractor is fulfilling his or her responsibilities and is abiding to all relevant safety programs and procedures should be maintained before, and throughout, all work in or near covered process areas by responsible facility personnel.  Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nThe Mobile Site maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including incident command, proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Mobile Site has developed procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes or other facility areas.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Mobile Site is coordinated with the Mobile County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Mobile Site has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility's plan covers topics such as responding to a potential release, fire, explosion, or chemical release.   Procedures and practices related to the maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment are also in place.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties. \n\n\n\nTypes of RMP site specific prevention steps include the following:\n\n-Release detection (e.g., process alarms, operator surveillance, portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment);\n\n-Release containment and control (e.g.,relief systems, dikes to contain liquid releases, back-up equipment, control valves); and\n\n-Release Mitigation (e.g., area firewater monitors, emergency response equipment, trained emergency response personnel).\n\n ",

              "Description": "Shell Chemical LP - Mobile Site (\"refinery\" or \"facility\")views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.  The Shell facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.  The following sections will provide an overview of the various elements of the facility's PSM program.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe cornerstone of the PSM program is Process Safety Information (PSI). Process Safety Information defines the chemical hazards, equipment, and technology in a given process.  Maintaining the PSI enables Shell employees involved in operating the covered processes to identify and understand the hazards posed by such processes involving OSHA PSM Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment conditions, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS  \n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  Typically, the Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methodology is used to conduct process unit PHAs.  This technique may be supplemented using the ?What If?, ?Checklist? or ?What If/Checklist? techniques.  PHA team members include operations, tank farm, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed.  PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved and process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use.  PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.   \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3)temporary operations, (4) emergency operations,(5) emergency shutdowns, (6) normal shutdowns, and (7)startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shell has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. The operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The training includes an emphasis on unit specific safety and health hazards and emergency operations including shutdown.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training.  Records for refresher and classroom training should be maintained onsite and include the employee?s name, date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training. \n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe facility has well-established procedures and practices to maintain pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps, and critical instrument systems are in a safe operating condition.  The mechanical integrity program includes ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment, and quality assurance practices, as applicable, to verify their suitability for the process application for which they will be used.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to its processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and other facility changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure the (1) technical basis of the proposed change,(2)impact of the change on process related safety and health, (3) modifications to operating procedures, and (4) necessary time period for the change.  In addition, the procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\n \n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new process or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, such as, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the facility will periodically conduct a compliance audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audtits are required to be evaluated at least once every three years, with the RMP Compliance audit teams findings developed in a report.  The compliance audit report is required to be reviewed to determine and document resolution of the audit team?s findings.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are required to be retained.  \n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS\n\n\n\nShell investigates all RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  The investigation team's recommendations are required to be tracked to resolution and documented.  The RMP incident investigation results are required to be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.  \n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include the site health and safety committee, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and management of change activities.  Employees have access to all information generated from the facility's accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\nThe facility has a hot work permit procedure in place for all work performed at or near covered process areas.  The intent of the hot work permit is to ensure that appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is being utilized before the work begins.  The permit must document that the OSHA fire prevention and/or chemical protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations.  The permit should specify the dates on which the work is authorized and identify the specific process/equipment on which hot work is to be performed.  All permits should be kept on file until the workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe facility uses a contractor safety program that includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator.  Before selecting contractors to perform any work on or near covered process areas, the safety performance of the contractor and contractor safety programs should be evaluated.  Verification that the contractor is fulfilling his or her responsibilities and is abiding to all relevant safety programs and procedures should be maintained before, and throughout, all work in or near covered process areas by responsible facility personnel.  Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nThe Mobile Site maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including incident command, proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Mobile Site has developed procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes or other facility areas.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Mobile Site is coordinated with the Mobile County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Mobile Site has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility's plan covers topics such as responding to a potential release, fire, explosion, or chemical release.   Procedures and practices related to the maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment are also in place.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties. \n\n\n\nTypes of RMP site specific prevention steps include the following:\n\n-Release detection (e.g., process alarms, operator surveillance, portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment);\n\n-Release containment and control (e.g.,relief systems, dikes to contain liquid releases, back-up equipment, control valves); and\n\n-Release Mitigation (e.g., area firewater monitors, emergency response equipment, trained emergency response personnel).\n\n ",
