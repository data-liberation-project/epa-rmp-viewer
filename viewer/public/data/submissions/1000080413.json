A range of other fuel products such as liquid petroleum gases, gasoline and kerosene are also produced at the facility. \r\n\r\nThe facility's risk management program and maximum chemical inventory were evaluated and  it was determined that the facility's processess render the facility subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements.  Moreover, the processess render the facility subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR 1910.119.  As such, the terminal is subject to RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.  \r\n\r\nShell maintains a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs, and work practices that are related to the RMP Prevention Program elements.  These policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, and are designed to further enhance the facility's existing safety programs and procedures.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nShell views the health and safety of its employees and the communitity in which it operates as its top priority.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including incident command, proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Mobile Site has developed procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes or other facility areas.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Mobile Site is coordinated with the Mobile County, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives."
