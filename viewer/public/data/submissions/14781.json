              "Description": "FP International, Thornton, IL has established a Process Hazard Analysis Team to identify equipment, operating procedures, and conditions where the potential exist for employee exposure and environmental hazards associated with the Flo-Pak manufacturing process. Employee hazards would typically involve Flo-Pak manufacturing spills and/or accidential releases of isobutane and isopentane. Environmental hazards occur when vapor releases or liquid spills reach beyound the propertry line into the atmosphere, or into the ground. The \"What If\" methodology has been selected for the process hazard analysis at this facility. The Process Hazard Analysis Team consist of a minumum of three employees. These employees have expertise in engineering, process operations, maintenence, and includes one person with the knowledge and experience specific to the process operations. Once all recommendations have been made, they will be submitted to the Corporate Safety Manager for review. All process hazard analysis will be reviewed every five years and will be kept the lifetime of the process.",

Accidental release prevention and Emergency response policies.\nIn this facility, we use isopentane and isobutane, which is considered flammable by the EPA. The same properties that make isopentane and isobutane valuable as blowing agents in our manufacturing processes also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling them. These precautions are in place to prevent the unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the treat to our personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the treat to members of the nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle isopentane and isobutane. This combined with the safety devices inherent in the design, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our employees help insure the safety of our employees and our community. Our emergency response program is meant to comply with the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Law (Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Act). FP International's response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\n2) The stationary source and regulated substance handled.\nA)  At our  Thornton facility, FP International collects and recycles post consumer and industrial polystyrene for the use in manufacturing of our product. During the Flo-Pak manufacturing process, blowing agents (a 50% - 50% mixture of isopentene and isobutane) are injected into a polystyrene melt as it is extruded. Four above ground storage tanks are used to separately store the blowing agents. \nB)  The regulated substance handled at this facility is isopentane and isobutane. \nC)  The maximum amount stored at this facility is 106,000 pounds. \n\n\n3.

Our company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of each tank to 85% at 60 degrees F. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source, which results in a vapor cloud explosion. \nThe distance to the end point of 1 psi for the worst case scenario is .3 miles.\n\nB)  Alternative scenario: \nA pull away causing failure of a 25\" length hose on the largest above ground tank(9,808 gallons). The manually operated shut off valve will stop the flow. Although it is unlikely, if the vapor reaches an ignition source it would result in a vapor cloud fire.\nThe estimated distance to lower flammability limit is <  .1 miles.\n \n\n\n\n\n4) The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps.\nThis manufacturing facility complies with the EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and with all applicable State Codes and Regulations. This facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58.\nAs part of our Corporate Injury Illness and Prevention Plan all employees receive training covering the following aspects of health and safety; safety philosophy, general safety rules, reporting safety hazards, emergency procedures and hazardous communications. In addition to the training received upon initial training, further training is given if any employee is exposed to a hazard previously unrecognized, or if any employee is reassigned to a job which exposes them to new hazards. Our Corporate Hazard Communication Plan, which is located in our safety manual contains, safe work practices, the use and care of personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures in case of spills or releases. Emergency and first-aid procedures are also covered.    \n"
