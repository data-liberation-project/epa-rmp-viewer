      "SummaryText": "Central Ohio Farmers Co-op (formerly Marion Landmark) is a farmer-owned cooperative located in North Central Ohio.  Our New Bloomington Branch, in addition to handling grain, is also involved with providing crop services and supplies to local farmers.  Part of this supply business includes the selling of anhydrous ammonia.  Farmers use this anhydrous ammonia as a source of nitrogen for their corn.  In terms of processes, ours is a very simple one.  We purchase anhydrous ammonia in bulk and then it is transferred to smaller tanks which are then taken to the fields for application.\n\nWhen our anhydrous ammonia storage area was established, it was inspected and certified by the State of Ohio Department of Agriculture.   Our storage tanks are locked out at all times.  What this means is that the valves are padlocked for safety and security.  In addition to locking out the tanks, there are other safety features such as excess flow valves, and pressure release valves to insure that the highest level of safety and security are maintained.  These safety features are indicative of the commitment to safety that is shared by all employees of Central Ohio Farmers Co-op from the top down.  This commitment to safety is evident by the mandatory attendance to regular safety meetings, the training updates and reviews, and an overall genuine concern for our employees well being.                                                           \n\nAs far as our five year accident history, we have only one small incident to report.  This April (2004) a transfer valve failed and allowed approximately 80-90 lbs of anhydrous ammonia to be released.  No one was injured and there was no need for any evacuation.   The faulty valve was replaced, and we inspected all other equipment for potential problems.  We will perform periodic evaluations to assess our equipment.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time."

It has been deemed that the New Bloomington Volunteer Fire Department will be the primary responder and will be in charge of any emergency situations.  We have a very close relationship with them in that it is a volunteer fire department and many of the members are customers.  We are also in contact with the Marion County Emergency Planning Commitee as well as the local Sheriff, Police, etc..  Our employees have been trained to know where to go and what to do in case of an emergency.  We also have good relationships with utilities and contractors if need be, and have designated emergency coordinators in place to help keep things calm and to direct operations until the fire department shows up.  We also have emergency procedures in place to help the coordinators deal with several different emergency situations.  We take safety very seriously, and our history reflects that."
