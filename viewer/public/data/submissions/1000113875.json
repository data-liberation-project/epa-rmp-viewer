In addition, some of the detail provided within this summary was excluded from the submitted RMP as current public access to this detail could expose the facility and personnel to terrorist or criminal activity.\n\nCebro Frozen Foods prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2745, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. Finally, both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM standards as defined in CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\nThis program was updated to satisfy the required 5-year update per section 2745.10(a) (1) and to make corrections as necessary. All elements have been reviewed and updated.\n\nThe following areas are addressed in this summary:\n\n1.\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls"

Cebro will rely on outside responders from the Newman Fire Department and the Stanislaus County HazMat Team for mitigation of releases. The ERP details the steps for required notification of outside agencies and the public and states that the Cebro Emergency Coordinator will be in charge until such time as an outside responding agency assumes that role. Cebro management will oversee evacuation and remain in control until Newman Fire Department arrives, then Incident Command will be assumed by the senior Newman Fire Department official at the scene. The Newman Fire Department Incident Commander will be responsible for issuing notices for public evacuation and/or sheltering in place, if necessary. Cebro management will be responsible for making initial contact with Newman Fire Department via 9-1-1; Stanislaus County Environmental Management Department; CalOES, federal NRC, and any other agencies that need to be contacted. Cebro will rely on community responders for medical assistance as necessary. Responsibility for cleanup after the release is spelled out in the ERP.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEmployees, community safety, the environment and product care are primary concerns at this facility.  Several PHA studies were conducted at Cebro Frozen Foods and the study team made recommendations for additional safety.  The most recent PHA study occurred in June of 2022 as part of the 5-year revalidation.\n\nCebro will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly. Cebro has established completion schedules for proposed actions. Management responses and support will be consistent with Cebro's commitment to safe and environmentall"

Cebro Frozen Foods has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\nIn the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Cebro personnel are trained in the appropriate mitigation measures, relying on emergency services provided by the Newman fire department and the Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Response team. Cebro will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM program.\n\nAll releases and near misses are recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop policies and/or procedures that may prevent future incidents.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCebro is located at 2100 Orestimba Road in Newman, California. The facility is approximately 2 miles west of Highway 33, which runs north and south through Newman. The area is zoned for agricultural and industrial use.

A new cold storage warehouse was constructed in 2008 with new and refurbished refrigeration system components.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, the only regulated substance, is used in the facility's two refrigeration systems: the process system (Process 1) and the warehouse system (Process 2). The process refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 17,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The process system provides cooling to the cold storage rooms, a quick freezer, and a plate chiller. The cold rooms are used to store fresh and frozen vegetables. The quick freezer is used for initial vegetable freezing. The plate pre-chiller provides cold water for cleaning and cooling the fresh vegetables. A second refrigeration system, the warehouse system, was constructed in 2008 to provide cooling to a cold storage warehouse built next to the processing facility. The warehouse system which is a closed system, contains approximately 11,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe quantity of ammonia in the process and warehouse systems mean that the systems fall under the OSHA PSM regulations and as a result, falls under the Program Level 3 regulations of the RMP/CalARP regulations and submitted as such. \n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP. Program 3 facilities (and Program 2 facilities) are required to evaluate a Worst-Case Release Scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an Alternative Release Scenario. The regulations define a Worst-Case Release Scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThis facility has prepared Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.
