      "SummaryText": "High Track, LLC is a newly constructed cold storage warehouse located at 4704 Terminal Drive in McFarland, WI. High Track, LLC plans to start serving customers by the end of December, 2004. The majority of the cold storage rooms will be freezers\n\nAt our facility, anhydrous ammonia (cas #7664-41-7) is used as a refrigerant to maintain the desired air temperatures of our freezers, cooler rooms, and docks. Designed as a closed-loop, two-stage compression system, liquid ammonia is pumped to each of the room air-cooling evaporators from one of the two pump receivers. A mix of ammonia liquid and vapor returns to the pump receivers where the liquid is separated from the vapor. Ammonia vapor is pulled from the pump receivers, compressed, and sent to rooftop condensers where it is cooled and condensed to a liquid to be used again by the evaporators. The maximum high-side system operating pressure is 175 psig but the highest pressure that the system normally operates at ranges between 125 to 150 psig. The maximum quantity of ammonia on-site is 30,000 lbs.\n\nMany safety features have been incorporated into the design and installation of the ammonia refrigeration system to protect the system and its components from a catastrophic failure and release of ammonia and to minimize the impact should an incident occur. Notable safety design features include:\n\n1.    System operation and monitoring by a programmable logic controller (PLC). The PLC controls the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system including loading and unloading compressors to handle the load demands of the system, sequencing condenser fans and water pumps to maintain a safe high-side operating pressure and controlling the cooling and defrost cycles of area evaporators to maintain room temperatures. The PLC also monitors the operating parameters of the system such as pressures, temperatures, and liquid levels and will either initiate an alarm or shut down the system (depending on the type of alarm) when any of the p"

      "SummaryText": "arameters are out of range. \n\n2.    Each compressorA?s microprocessor uses the latest technology to ensure compressors operate within safe pressures and temperatures and are adequately lubricated. The microprocessors will shut down any compressor that operates outside of safe limits. \n\n3.    Emergency ventilation system installed in the engine room that meets or exceeds all applicable codes. The emergency ventilation system is automatically turned on by ammonia detectors installed inside the engine room or they can be manually started using switches located outside of the engine room.\n\n4.    Ammonia detectors installed in all process rooms that will alarm if any ammonia is detected in the freezers, dock or cooler areas.\n\n5.    Except for the piping located in the engine room, all process piping and control valves are located outside of the process areas. \n\n6.    Freezer evaporators are roof-mounted, penthouse units. This eliminates the risk of air-cooling evaporators and ammonia piping being impacted by forklifts and the accidental release of ammonia into process areas and exposing workers to hazardous chemicals.\n\n7.    A firemanA?s dump station is located outside of the building so that in the event of a fire inside the facility, if there is a risk of explosion, fire department personnel can dump the ammonia charge before pressures exceed equipment ratings.\n\n8.    Automatic fire sprinkler systems have been installed throughout the entire facility including the engine room.  \n\nIn addition to all of the safety features incorporated into the design of the system, High Track, LLC complies with the following regulations, codes and guidelines: \n\nOSHA Process Safety Management regulation 1910.119\nANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15-2001\nANSI/IIAR 2-1999\nASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Codes\nANSI B31.3 Piping Code\nIIAR industry guidelines for safety and good engineering practices\nNFPA guidelines for fire protection equipment\n  \nHigh Track, LLC has also established a maintenance program to ensure that routin"

      "SummaryText": "e and preventive maintenance tasks, inspections and tests are conducted to maintain the ongoing mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system and safety systems. In addition, the facility has established initial and refresher training requirements for ammonia refrigeration operators and mechanics as well as awareness training for all facility employees.\n\nAll facility employees are trained on the hazards of ammonia and how to recognize and report accidental releases. They are also trained on evacuation procedures, where to go and what to do once they have evacuated the building. High Track, LLC has established and trained an emergency response team to handle small leaks as well as major releases of ammonia. Emergency response efforts are coordinated with the McFarland Fire and Police Departments and the Dane County LEPC. Facility personnel will evaluate and respond to all ammonia releases that are within their training, capability and resources. If facility personnel cannot safely control and mitigate the release, or the incident would affect the public or the environment, the facility will notify the McFarland Police and Fire Department for assistance.\n\nSince this is a new facility, there is no accident history to report. Through regular audits, training, maintenance, and system testing and inspection programs, High Track, LLC intends to establish a history of safe operation."
