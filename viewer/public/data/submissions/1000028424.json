The Facility is a chemical distribution plant, which stores, sells, and repackages industrial gases.\n\n\n\nBased on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substances are stored by the Facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity:\n\n\n\nAcetylene gas (CAS # 74-86-2)\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of product that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nAt this time, there are no planned changes to improve the safety of the process. If Airgas identifies technologies or procedures that might improve safety, they will evaluate the feasibility of such a change and implement if appropriate.\n\n\n\nAitgas manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, and safety devices (relief devices).  Safe work practices and a well trained work force supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the local fire authority and hazardous material response team. Airgas coordinates with the jurisdictional fire department and invites their inspection."
