The facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Managment Program rule under the Clean Air Act ammendments of 1990.\n  The Risk Management Program rule requires a facility which handles threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to develop a program (if one is not already in existance) to prevent accidential release of these substances and to minimize the consequences of releases that do occur. \n  The following is a summary of the Risk Managment Plan for Equalizer Inc. Waco Tx.\n  The Equalizer Inc terminal located near Waco in central Texas, serves as a storage and distribution terminal for liquid fertilizer products and the blending and distribution of liquid cattle feeds.In addition to storage, blending and distribution, the Equalizer Inc. location is used for the site of processing AmoniumPolyPhosphate using a portable T reactor. The Equalizer Inc. facility serves as a vital link in the fertilizer distribution system by storing products in close proximity to the central Texas agricultural producers so that they may be delivered in a timely manner. Additionaly Equalizer Inc. Is commited to being a solid reliable member of the local community with several employees being involved in community organizations and youth activities.\n  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Equalizer facility that is subject to the requirments of the Risk Managment Program rule. The Anhydrous ammonia is received by rail in pressurized cars when it is quickly processed into liquid AmmoniumPolyPhosphate using a portable T reactor. The AmmoniumPolyPhosphate is stored in above ground tanks until needed by agrcultural producers. In addition to being used as a crop nutriant, the AmmoniumPolyphosphate is used as source of Phosphorus and NPN in liquid cattle feed suppliments.\n  It is the policy of Equalizer Inc to e"
