      "SummaryText": "Polycell International Corp.\nBiola, Ca\n\nIt is Polycell policy to conduct its business incompliance with applicable health, safety, and environmental laws. The health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities and prevention of pollution are among Polycell primary concerns. Polycell is committed to providing safe working conditions for our employees, to promoting the safe design, use and handling of Polycell products and to comply with the laws relating to the protection of the environment. Each employee is expected to promote these goals in thier tasks. \n\nThe Polycell Biola facilty manufactures polyethylene foam products used as packing material\nPolyethylene foam sheets, planks, rounds are produced using an extruder. The extruder performs three distinct functions: melts and plasticizes the polyethylene, disperes and mixes the blowing agent with poluethlene, and cools the mixture sufficiently to prevent cell collapse when the material is extruded through the dies. Polyethylene resin pellets are melted in the extruded. The blowing agent is pumped into the extruded under pressure. Once the polyethlene / blowing agent mixture leaves the die, and the mixture is no longer under pressure, the blowing agent vaporizers and begins to expand the material into foam.\nThe blowing agent is stored in a approved pressure vessel as non-odorized liquid petroleum gas under pressure( 125 psi max). The liquid is pumped at low pressure to the high pressure metering systemand controls which controls the flow of the blowing agent into the extruder.\n\nThe facility has one blowing agent tank it is rate for 250 psi and has a watercapcity of 15,768 gallons.\n\nThe worst-case release scenarios and the alternative releasr scenarios\nAflammable worst case scenario assumes a butane vapor cloud explosion using EPA'S rmp-comp guidance for a propane storage facility. The calculated endpoint distance with the release of the full storage vessel (65,224 lbs) with 1 psi endpoint is 0.30 miles or "

      "SummaryText": "(1584 ft). The estimated residental population within the distance is 90 people. The liklihood of a vapor cloud explosion with a full storage vessel release is possible but highly unlikely. The more possible scenario would be a leak of the piping at the storage tank. As an alternate scernio, we have considered the repute of a pipe with a release rate 73 pound per minute for 10 mintues crating a vapor cloud explosion. The estimated distance to 1 psi over- pressure endpoint would be 0.05 mile or (264 ft). The estimated resdental population would 15 people.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and prevention steps:\n\nA)  Employees education and training:\na)  all employees recieve initial and yearly refresher training in our hazardous Commutation program, and spill and emergency spill response plans.\nb)  a Management of Change procedures is used toassure thaat onl authorized changes are made to the process,\nc)  incident investigation procedures are followed to address areas of concern,\nd)  an Emergency Action Plan is used to document and train employees to handle non-routine situations,\ne)  daily inventory reconiliations of the blowing agent tanks are conducted,\nf)  maintanence personnel physically inspect the blowing agent systems each shift (2-times per day) and inspect the hazardous materials storage areas,\ng)  the blowing agent equipment is equipped with eleectronic sensors which are monitored 24-hours per day by plant personnel and a private security firm,\nh)  the blowing agent tanks are coated with 2-hour rated fire protective material,\ni)  the blowing agent equipment and tanks are protected by an assortment of physical barriers,\nj)  the blowing agent equipment and tanks are installed under the recommendations of the National Fire Protection Association Codes #58 and #70\n\nThe five-year accident history\nWe have had no accidental releases of blowing agents in the past five years.  An accidental release is a spill of 500 pounds or more of our blowing age"

It provides a written document for detailing actions and procedures to be followed in an emergency.  These plans have been developed with, and to meet, regulations 1910.38(a).\nAt the time of an emergency, employees have been trained to know what type of evacuation is necessary and what their role is in carrying out the plan.  In some cases when the emergency is very grave, total and immediate evacuation of all employees is necessary.  In other emergencies, a partial evacuation of\n\n nonessevtial employees, with a delayed evacuation of others, may be necessary for continuation of plant procedures.  \n\nPolycell International Inc. Biola has very robust environmental health and safety programs that are driven by active employee participation.  these weekly and monthly inspections and training programs are ongoing events that contribute to our commitment to creating a safe and healthy work environment.\n\nCertification Statement\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information sobmitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\nLazar Chang                                       2-27-01\n\nGeneral Manager"
