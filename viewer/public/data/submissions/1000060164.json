There is approximately 10,140 lbs of ammonia in the facility, based on receipts for ammonia purchases.\n\n\n\nThe facility's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  It is the policy of Management to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.  The prevention plan meets all the requirements of OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) regulations.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration personnel do not respond to large ammonia releases and have not received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1920.120.  Actions to prevent a major release shall be attempted only by refrigeration personnel from an area that is not threatened by release, if possible.  If not possible, they will evacuate.  Other employees will be evacuated or sheltered-in-place as appropriate.  The Fire Department or Hazmat Team will take control of the incident upon arrival at the plant.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.  The plan has been reviewed with the local fire department.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\n\n  Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n\n  Reduce the threat to our personnel\n\n  Reduce the threat to the community and environment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility has one engine room and 19 CA rooms.  The largest vessel will hold 13,299 lbs of ammonia, however it will never be filled to "
