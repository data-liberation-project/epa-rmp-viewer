The worst-case release scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 131,288 pounds of anhydrous ammonia; this represents the volume of the larger storage tank administratively limited at 85% of capacity. The alternative release scenario, based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident), is a release from a broken 2-inch diameter pipe with an increased wind speed and D stability modeling parameters.\r\n\r\nAqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios. The worst-case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 131,670 pounds of aqua ammonia that forms a liquid pool.
