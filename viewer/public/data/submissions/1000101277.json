In addition, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet the RMP definition of accident as described above.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nThe J&B Cold Storage facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) has been developed by J&B Cold Storage and is included in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.) To save lives.\r\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.) To protect the environment.\r\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\r\n\r\nThe J&B Cold Storage facility has a trained Emergency Response Team onsite that responds to emergency situations, including chemical releases.

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by J&B Cold Storage to prevent the accidental release of ammonia at the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that J&B Cold Storage employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room and throughout the facility, which will alert operators of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines accident as the following:\r\n\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance"

J&B Cold Storage's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Safety Director, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at 13200 43rd Street NE, in St. Michael, Minnesota was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the International Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process is composed of two (2) co-located closed looped ammonia refrigeration systems that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The systems, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 37,000 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock, blast freezer, and cooler/freezer storage. The majority of the equipment is located in the engine room including the vessels and compressors.
