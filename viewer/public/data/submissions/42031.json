This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\nAcknowledge the continued operation of an existing source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements. (EPA RMP Facility ID# 1000-0016-4877)\n\nCKCC uses anhydrous ammonia and stores greater than 20,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia making the site subject to both the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and the Federal RMP Program under 40 CFR 68. The site is subject to the OSHA and EPA Process Safety Management Regulations. The site has been determined to be a Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe RMP addresses the Program 3 requirements of CalARP as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the ?general duty clause? of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP Program 3 requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\nidentify hazards\n\ndesign and maintain a safe facility\n\nprevent releases\n\nminimize the consequences of releases.\n\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented RMP, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. \n\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\n\nThis RMP applies to the CKCC facility located at:\n\n750 Metz Road\n\nKing City, CA.  93930\n\nLatitude: 360 13? 30?, Longitude -1210 7? 38?\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe CKCC facility is a 111-megawatt (MW) (nominal output) natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant.

The Monterey County and/or King City Fire Departments will be the first responders in an ammonia emergency.

In the event of a major release, CKCC may join forces with the fire departments and State/County OES personnel in a \"unified command effort\" until the emergency has been mitigated.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Elements\n\nChemical specific prevention measures are summarized as follows:\n\nPeriodic inspection of ammonia tank, containment area, pumps, piping network, flow controllers, and injection grid.\n\nMonitoring of tank and system pressures and temperatures.\n\nMonitoring of unloading/delivery procedures.\n\nInstallation and use of ammonia detector(s) in the main tank area.\n\nProvide all required safety and response equipment.\n\nProvide a chemical specific training program.\n\nAccess to the CKCC facility site is controlled and fenced.\n\nThe piping and distribution network is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves, which effectively limit the amount and duration of any accidental release. System pressures and flow rates will be monitored at the main plant control room console. Review of the P&IDs (Appendix C) indicates that there are numerous pressure, temperature, and level indicator sensors, which will be reported directly to the distributed control system (DCS) for operator confirmation and action.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    Presently, Calpine is operating and constructing a number of similar peaking and base loaded power generation facilities in California. Data developed from the operational experience at these facilities will be directly applied to the operation and safety aspects of the CKCC facility. Operational and safety issues identified at any Calpine facility are immediately analyzed for applicability to other operational sites.

These modifications may require that the process safety information be revised and updated. The pre-startup review applies to additions or modifications, which require the process safety information to be updated. The facility pre-startup safety review procedure will be contained within the plant operations manuals. The review generally addresses the following issues:\n\nEquipment designed and installed according to prevailing industry standards and specifications.\n\nConstruction per existing building and seismic codes and standards.\n\nAdequate safety and emergency procedures are developed and implemented.\n\nPHA performed prior to startup.\n\nMoC procedures initiated and completed.\n\nTraining of affected employees initiated and completed.\n\nWhenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-startup safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the MoC review. Additionally, a pre-startup safety review will be performed in conjunction with the MoC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nAn essential element of the RMP program is the use of periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan. Compliance audits under the federal and state RMP regulations must be conducted, at a minimum of once every three years. The periodic compliance audit addresses the following:\n\nImplementation and comprehension of the current plan elements.\n\nAre plan revisions required.\n\nDoes the plan adequately address all required RMP elements.\n\nEffectiveness of the current plan.\n\nLevel of employee involvement.\n\nManagement commitment to plan provisions.\n\nThe audit "
