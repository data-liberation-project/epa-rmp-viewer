EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure.  EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate.  In addition, the release must take place during the worst possible weather conditions.  For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.  In addition, the Honeywell Delaware Plant is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario for the chemicals covered by the RMP regulations.\n\nThe Honeywell Delaware Plant has six chemicals which are currently subject to the RMP rule: boron trifluoride, methyltrichlorosilane, ethyl chloride, ethyl ether, hydrofluoric acid, and sulfur trioxide.  Boron trifluoride, methyltrichlorosilane, hydrofluoric acid, and sulfur trioxide are all classified as toxics under the RMP rule.  Ethyl chloride and ethyl ether are both classified as flammables under the RMP rule.  For the Delaware plant, the RMP rule requires modeling the worst case scenario for one toxic (Hydrofluoric Acid in this case), the worst case scenario for one flammable (ethyl chloride in this case), one alternative release scenario for each of the four regulated toxins (boron trifluoride, methyltrichlorosilane, hydrofluoric acid and sulfur trioxide), and the alternative release scenario for one flammable (ethyl chloride in this case).\n\n3a. Worst Case Scenarios\nThe worst case scenario for hydrofluoric acid would involve the failure of the hydrofluoric acid storage tank containing 250,000 pounds of hydrofluoric acid at a temperature of 95\u00b0F.  The entire release would be in the form of a gas since hydrofluoric acid is stored as a gas liquefied under pressure and it has a boiling point of 65\u00b0F.

In accordance with the modeling requirements under the RMP rule for a flammable gas, the ethyl chloride would be released instantaneously, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  Since this facility is located in a populated area, the vapor cloud explosion would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for methyltrichlorosilane would involve a hose uncoupling during the unloading of methyltrichlorosilane into its storage tank.  The methyltrichlorosilane would spill into a diked containment area (840 square feet with 1.5-foot walls), which would mitigate the release.  Over the course of one hour following the spill, 2,175 pounds of methyltrichlorosilane would evaporate from the pool.  Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating methyltrichlorosilane would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for boron trifluoride would involve a weld failure in the high purity process piping.  The high purity boron trifluoride process area is equipped with remote operated valves which would be used to isolate the leak after the release begins, thereby mitigating the release.  The high purity boron trifluoride process area is also equipped with a water spray system which would be used to further mitigate the release.  A total of 250 pounds of boron trifluoride would be released under pressure.

The SO3 is released into an 1152 square foot dike at the rate of 4484 pounds per minute.  The vapor pressure of the SO3 at its storage temperature is 414 mmHg.  The rate of sulfur trioxide evaporation from the spill is calculated to be 234 pounds per minute. The distance to the sulfur trioxide endpoint concentration would be 0.45 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ethyl chloride would involve a leak from a hose during the transfer of ethyl chloride.  The ethyl chloride storage area is equipped with a water spray system which would be used to mitigate the release.  A total of 3,060 pounds of ethyl chloride would be released under pressure.  In accordance with the modeling requirements under the RMP rule for a flammable gas, the ethyl chloride release would be followed by a vapor cloud explosion.
