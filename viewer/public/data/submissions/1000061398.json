This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant located in Eddy County, New Mexico, is  owned by Enterprise Field Services L.L.C. and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC..\n\n\n\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant is a cryogenic turboexpander gas processing facility that utilizes cooling and pressure reduction to reduce the temperature of an inlet field gas stream to a very low temperature, causing liquefiable hydrocarbons to condense from the gas stream.   The mixed hydrocarbon liquid stream (Y-Grade product) is treated to remove carbon dioxide and is pumped as a mixed product via pipeline to fractionation facilities elsewhere.  The plant discharge gas stream (residue gas) flows from the plant via a residue gas pipeline to market..  \n\n\n\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities to be kept on site based on the process design of the proposed process vessels.  Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Chaparral Gas Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and pentane.  The Plant is designed to ope"

      "SummaryText": "rate unattended, seven days per week, with occasional shutdowns for major equipment maintenance.  There are no other gas processing, gas compression or industrial facilities nearby.  Due to the presence of regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity, the Chaparral Gas Plant is being registered as an EPA Risk Management Program 1 facility..  \n\n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site, but no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  The calculated distance for the Worst Case Scenario is less than the distance to the nearest offsite receptor.  Since there have been no accidents with offsite consequences within the last five years and emergency response is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Commission, the plant qualifies as an RMP Program 1 facility.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the safety and accident prevention program in place at the Chaparral Gas Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  However, the remote location of the Chaparral Gas Plant allows the facility to be registered as an RMP Program 1 facility, which does not need to have an accident prevention program to protect the public.  The following describes the standard Enterprise safety management program that is in place to protect the employees at the Chaparral Gas Plant.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances b"

These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant will promptly investigate any incidents that result in or reasonably could result in  a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team will document its findings, develop recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forward these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant has safety features and controls to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n*Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n\n*Plant video surveillance system (currently being installed)\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n\n\n*Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n*Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n*Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\n\n*Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases.\n\n*Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n*Hand-held fire extinguishers   \n\n*Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n\n*Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective cloth"

The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  \n\n \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Chaparral Gas Plant is coordinated with the Eddy County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). The Chaparral Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Chaparral Gas Plant will conduct periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and will provide periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nEnterprise Products Operating, LLC is committed to the safe design and operation of all of its processing and fractionation plants and liquid hydrocarbon terminals and resolves all findings from PHA's, some of which result in modifications to the storage and loading operations.  Additionally, employee recommendations to improve the safety of the storage and loading operations are reviewed and implemented if they are jud"
