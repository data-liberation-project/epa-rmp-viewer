The plant is staffed by approximately 13 regular employees.  This plant is located north of Yuba City adjacent to the Feather River.  There are some residences and commercial/industrial occupancies nearby.  The facility treats water from the Feather River.  The water plant has a capacity of 42MGD.  The City has one regulated acutely hazardous material on site ??A? chlorine.   \n\nThese EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Support Documents satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.  \n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe WTP accidental release prevention policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The facility adheres to all applicable procedures of the federal EPA Risk Management Program (EPA-RMP).  The emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to this plant and to the emergency response of the community and local responding agencies.  It is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (ARP) is in compliance with the federal and State OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and is based upon the following key elements:\n??A?    A high level of training for the facility state certified plant operators.\n??A?    A preventive maintenance program with strict adherence.\n??A?    Use of state of the art process and safety equipment to control and neutralize any accidental release of chemical.\n??A?    The use of an accurate and effective operating procedure written with participation of the operators.\n??A?    Performance of hazard review of equipment and procedures.\n??A?

This plan, as required by State and local regulatory agencies, also contains information and procedures relating to chlorine processing equipment, handling, leak response and repair procedures, education and safety training.  It contains a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and various report forms.\n\n\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM - PREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Yuba City Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, policy, and management practices.  It is in compliance with all EPA Prevention Program Requirements.\n\n1.    Process Safety Information ??A? Yuba City WTP has developed and maintains written safety information about the chlorination process and the technology of process equipment used.  The operation of this facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and to the OSHA regulations regarding Process Safety Management.\n2.    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) ??A? A PHA has been conducted appropriate to the complexity of the chlorination process that identified, evaluated, and controlled potential hazards using the ??A?What-If Checklist??A? and ??A?Hazard Review Checklists??A? processes.  These processes include the analysis of hazards due to equipment malfunction and human error.  It describes steps used to detect and monitor releases.  This PHA will be updated every five years and the Yuba City WTP will conduct reviews whenever major changes occur to the process.\n3.    Operating Procedures ??A? The WTP has prepared written procedures that provide clear instructions for the safe operational activities associated with the process.  These procedures are included in the facility operations manual and the Process Safety Management manual.  The manual includes procedures for op"

Employee Training: - All existing and newly assigned employees are trained and tested competent in all operation procedures.  Training documentation is maintained on all applicable employees.                                                               5.    Mechanical Integrity ??A? The WTP has a preventive maintenance program that insures the mechanical integrity of its chlorination processing equipment, which includes periodic inspection, testing and an annual overhaul of critical processing equipment.\n6.    Management of Change - WTP has implemented written procedures to manage changes (except changes in-kind) to process chemical technology, equipment and procedures.  Employees affected by a change in a process are informed of and trained in the change prior to start up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operation procedures are updated accordingly.\n7.    Pre-Startup Review ??A? Written procedures have been developed to allow operators to perform a pre-startup safety review for new and modified chlorination equipment, or where modification to the process is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n8.    Compliance Audits ??A? Compliance audits will be performed every three years to verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  Water treatment plant supervisors will perform the audit.  A report will be developed and deficiencies will be corrected.  The two most recent audits will be kept.\n9.    Incident Investigation ??A? The Yuba City WTP will investigate any incident, which results or could result in a catastrophic release of chlorine gas.  The investigation will be conducted within 48 hours of the incident.  All key factors will be addressed and recommendations for correction will result.  Affected personnel will review the findings of the investigation.  The report will be kept "
