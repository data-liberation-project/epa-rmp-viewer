      "SummaryText": "The Dodge Company is located in Cambridge Massachusetts and has been in business for over 110 years.  Senior management is committed to protecting the health of its employees and the general public and is actively developing comprehensive safety management plans to achieve these objectives.\n\nThe Dodge Company provides embalming chemicals for mortuary services.  Raw materials are compounded or mixed at the Cambridge facility, bottled, and shipped to customers.  The first floor of the facility includes the warehouse, the compounding room, chemical storage areas, truck bays and a shipping room.  Administrative areas, offices, and laboratory space is contained on the second floor.  The amount of liquid formaldehyde regulated under the risk management plan (RMP) rule that is typically stored at the Cambridge location is 12,000 gallons.  The facility operates Monday through Thursday 8:00-5:15 with approximately 60 employees.\n\nThere are several measures in-place at the Dodge Company that serve to prevent/mitigate the release of liquid formaldehyde in the compounding, bottling, warehouse and shipping areas:\n\n- Fire extinguishers are located throughout the processing and warehouse areas and personnel that work in these areas have been trained on their proper use.\n- Personal protection equipment and spill kits are located throughout the processing and warehouse areas and personnel that work in these areas have been trained on their proper use.\n- Mixing of formaldehyde only occurs in the compounding room when two or more personnel are present and observing operations.\n- Shut-off valves at the storage tank and throughout the production line can immediately prevent chemical flow at several points in the process stream.\n- An emergency response plan has been established with the Cambridge Fire Department.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of formaldehyde at the Dodge Company since it began operations in 1893."
