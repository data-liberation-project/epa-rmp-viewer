As part of the water plant's Prevention Program, a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) review was conducted in accordance with the policies. Operating Procedures (OPs) and Maintenance Procedures (MPs) were also reviewed and updated with input from representatives from the maintenance staff, operations staff and supervision. The facility's Emergency Action Plan (EAP) was also revised and updated. Emergency response training exercises have been coordinated with the city fire department. A plant safety committee, with representatives from every area of the plant, meets monthly to discuss health and safety issues. Suggestions to improve safety are strongly encouraged. Automatic shut-off controls and an improved chlorine detection system have been added in the last five years.\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Midland Water Plant is located on the east side of Midland approximately 1 1/2 miles inside the city limits. Midland has a population of 41,685. Its major industry is the Dow Chemical Company. The water plant operates continuously with total of 14 full time operator, maintenance, laboratory, clerical and supervisory staff.\n\n\n\nThe Midland Water Treatment Plant is a municipally owned and operated treatment plant for producing a public water supply. The raw water source is from the Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation, a jointly owned municipal authority with the City of Saginaw, Michigan.\n\n\n\nThe raw water is taken from Lake Huron by the authority at its Whitestone Pumping Facility, near AuGres, Michigan. The only treatment given the water at the Whitestone facility prior to pumping the water to the two cities is the addition of chlorine. The purpose of the chlorination is for disinfection of bact"

The initial chlorination point is at the Whitestone Pumping Facility.\n\n\n\nUpon arrival of the chlorinated raw water at the Midland Water Plant, it undergoes conventional chemical and physical water treatment processes to make it into a safe and desirable public water supply. Additional chlorine must be added at the Midland Water Treatment Plant to ensure the water meets drinking water quality standards as delivered to the consumers. Chlorine is the only regulated substance at the plant. The maximum inventory of liquid chlorine at the water plant is 8 one-ton containers. The process uses a vacuum system to feed chlorine gas.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Midland Water Plant has had an ongoing safety program in compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations of OSHA. A consultant was engaged to assist the water plant's limited staff with the implementation of the RMProgram. The Risk Management Program guidance manual published by the American Water Works Association Research Foundation was used as a primary reference. Other informational materials and manuals from USEPA supplemented it. The water plant management determined that the chlorination process came under Program 3 of the regulation. A six person RMP Team was formed to help review the RMProgram. The Team consisted of the facility's most experienced and knowledgeable staff in the chlorination process. Included were a senior operator, a maintenance representative, the maintenance supervisor, and the operations supervisor. The other team members were the water superintendent and the consultant.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine process equipment is well maintained. The chlorinators, gas leak detectors and chlorine process piping have been replaced within the last five years. Automatic shut-off controls have been added. The replacement process was handled following the man"

The plant staff follow written operating procedures and are trained to safely operate the process equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Midland Water Plant has operated continuously for more than sixty years without a serious chemical release incident. The facility has had no reportable toxic chemical releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe water plant facility is unable to provide adequate Emergency Response from the limited plant staff. The City of Midland is a participant in a county wide, one plan program for dealing with hazardous materials. The first response for a chlorine release at the Midland Water Plant would be from the City of Midland Fire Department. The Midland Fire Department personnel have the training and equipment to respond and safely shut down or contain a chlorine release. The response time is less than ten minutes under most conditions. Response is initiated by a telephone call to the Central Dispatch operator (911). The water plant also has direct contact with the fire department via radio.\n\n\n\nAn on-site Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been adopted and implemented which provides for facility staff to be sheltered in place in the main water plant building, which is a separate building from the chlorination storage building. The plan includes the necessary emergency notification and contact numbers. It also includes emergency first-aid information. The (EAP) provides that local responders will provide public notification and reporting. A citywide siren warning system can be operated by the Central Dispatch operator to aid in notification of the public in a chemical release emergency. The Midland Fire and Police Department representatives regularly attend meetings with the Local Emergency Planning Committee to help coordinate community local response for notification and evacuation.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IM"
