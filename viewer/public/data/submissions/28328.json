      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary (40 CFR 68.155)\n\nBackground Data\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), TRANSFLO Terminal Services, Inc. has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Clarksburg, West Virginia facility.  The TTSI terminal provides transloading services between rail and truck transportation modes.  TRANSFLO has been in operation at this facility for 18 years.  The facility is located at 500 North 3rd Street Clarksburg, West Virginia.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nTRANSFLO is committed to protecting the health of its employees, contract operators, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is TRANSFLO policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTRANSFLO will handle anhydrous ammonia at this facility, transloading product from railroad tank cars to highway vehicles in quantities in excess of 30,000 pounds which will exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantities listed in 40- CFR 68 Appendix A.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, TRANSFLO has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by EPA.  TRANSFLO?s worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a single rail tank car with subsequent product release over a 10-minute period.  In developing the release parameters of the worst-case release scenario, TRANSFLO has not considered passive mitigation.  Using the EPA?s RMP*Comp software program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this scenario has the potential to result in a release with offsite consequences.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is considered to have an extremely low probability of occurrence.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nTRANSFLO also evaluated several other release scenarios considered to have "

      "SummaryText": "a higher-level probability of occurrence (although still a very low probability).  After careful review of both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, TRANSFLO has decided to include one alternative release scenario into the RMP document.  The alternative release scenarios were developed for evaluation because they reflect the type of incident with a release that is more likely to occur.\n\nThe alternative release scenario identified by TRANSFLO is the failure of a product transfer hose.  In developing the release parameters of Alternative Release Scenario1, TRANSFLO considered average response time to control the release and shut the transfer unit down.  Using EPA RMP*Comp software program and EPA?s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the toxic endpoint in the alternative release scenario has the potential to result in off site consequences at distances much less than the worst case release scenario.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, TRANSFLO has implemented several precautionary measures:\n\n?    TRANSFLO has developed standard operating procedures (SOP?s) for the transloading of anhydrous ammonia from railcar to truck for use by training and qualified employees.\n?    TRANSFLO encourages operator employees to voice concerns, offer suggestions and contribute to procedures, policies and process involving this product. Employees are expected to follow established procedures until employee based changes are implemented and communicated.\n?    TRANSFLO conducts operational duties and inspections to insure compliance with established procedures.\n?    A documented inspection and maintenance program for the transfer unit, railcars and trucks used for this operation.  These processes included preventative maintenance of the transfer unit to maintain on-board safety and control systems.\n\nThe transfer unit has been designed and constructed to meet or exceed the requirements outl"

The ANSI K61.1 document has been incorporated by reference into the National Fire Code with is the applicable fire code adopted by the State of West Virginia for local enforcement. \n\nA review of the National Fire Code finds that this operation is in compliance with all requirements of the code, local zoning requirements and state environmental regulations for air emissions.\n\nTRANSFLO will conduct initial familiarization sessions with the Clarksburg Fire Department on the hazardous ammonia. the transfer operation, emergency procedures and accident prevention systems.\n\nIn addition, the following agencies audit the TRANSFLO facility on a regular basis:\n\n    U.S. Department of Transportation- Hazardous Materials Inspectors\n    W. V. Railroad Commission\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nTRANSFLO has not handled anhydrous ammonia at this terminal during the past five years.  There are no accidents or releases to report.\n\nEmergency Response program\n\nTRANSFLO and the contract operator have documents emergency response plans and procedures in place at this facility to respond to and safely mitigate any release or accident involving anhydrous ammonia.  Included in the emergency response plan are measures to be taken internally by TRANSFLO operators to control the release, if possible, to make initial notification to local responders and to TRANSFLO headquarter.\n\nOperator personnel at the terminal are trained up to Hazardous Materials Operations level as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.120 Hazardous s Waste Operations and Emergency Response.  These employees may also perform activities under the specialist employee as defined by 1910.120.  These personnel receive annual training on activation of the facility emergency action plan, their roles in an emergency and accident notification procedures.\n\nTo assure that the local municipal response agencies are familiar with "
