Facility Accidental Release Policy - The owners, management, and employees of Walla Walla Farmers Coop, 111 North 9th., Walla Walla, Washington 99362, with branch operations at 113 South \"D\" Street, Prescott, Washington 99348, and 5003 West Brinkley Road, Kennewick, Washington are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  2.  Facility Information - * The primary activity at the Walla Walla Fertilizer Facility is the storage, blending and sale of fertilizers to farmers.  * Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  * At Walla Walla the anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and put into an 18,000 gallon and a 30,000 gallon above ground storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia at Walla Walla in storage is 210,120 pounds.  * At Walla Walla the converter, converts anhydrous ammonia to aqua ammonia and the product is transferred on site to 4 - 30,000 gallon above ground storage tanks.  During the peak seasons of the year additional product can be transported from off-site by truck to the Walla Walla storage tanks.  Product is transferred from the Walla Walla location by company tank truck to a 20,000 gallon above ground storage tank at the Prescott branch and to a 20,000 gallon above ground storage tank at the Kennewick branch.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia in storage at Walla Walla is 866,400 pounds.  3. The Worst CAse and Alternate Release Scenario's - a. Anhydrous Ammonia Worst Case and Alternativ"
