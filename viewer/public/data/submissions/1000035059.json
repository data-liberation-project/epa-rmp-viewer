Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical used at this facility that is subject to the CalARP program or federal RMP requirements.\r\n\r\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility and the Program 3 Prevention Program of the CalARP Program.  The prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  The prevention program is updated as required.\r\n\r\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the actions this facility will take in the event of an emergency.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders and safe evacuation of personnel on-site.  A primary Emergency Coordinator (EC) has been assigned to implement the required actions and a secondary Emergency Coordinator has been assigned as a backup to the primary EC.

The Stationary Source\r\n\r\nThe Olam facility is located in the agriculturally productive Central Valley in Modesto, California.  The plant is situated at about 90 feet above sea level at the southern border of the city limits of Modesto along Whitmore Avenue.  The land south of Whitmore Avenue (City of Ceres) has been developed for residential use.  The Union Pacific Railroad tracks separate the facility on the west from light industrial businesses.  The Post facility borders the northern property line of Olam and shares the same gated entrance on Whitmore Avenue.  Approximately 40 acres of agricultural land lie to the east, which in turn, are bordered by Morgan Road on the eastern border.\r\n\r\nThe Olam facility, operated since 1958, processes vegetables into a variety of bulk dehydrated and/or frozen products.  The facility operates three shifts throughout the year with some variance depending upon crop availability.  Raw vegetables are trucked to the site and unloaded prior to washing in the wet processing building. Once the vegetables have been washed, they are processed, dehydrated and/or frozen, and packaged.  The frozen vegetables may be re-blended for specific customers, which involves the use of ammonia refrigeration.\r\n\r\nPlant security is provided by a guard located at the main gate entrance to the facility.

The system is configured as a hybrid one-stage / two-stage mechanical refrigeration system that utilizes a recirculated liquid evaporator feed for product freezing.  The closed loop system uses both liquid pumped overfeed and flooded systems.\r\n\r\nThe system operates or is in pumpdown mode 24 hours a day each day of the year.  During operation, the system is attended by trained personnel.  On weekends, holidays, and other downtime periods, the system is in automatic pumpdown mode and does not require operators.  A supervisory alarm system monitors the ammonia sensors via the programmable logic controller (PLC) and notifies the Maintenance Manager immediately of any upset conditions.\r\nThe current capacity of the system is 797 TR, designed to operate at a low-stage saturated suction temperature of -50 \u00b0F SST.

The high-pressure vapor condenses to high-pressure liquid.

The intercooler was designed to desuperheat vapor to design conditions of 0 \u00baF @ 15 psig.\r\n\r\nThe second purpose of the intercooler is to subcool high-pressure liquid from the high-pressure receiver before it goes to the liquid recirculator package.

The release occurred as a result of actions by a contractor welder, who punctured ammonia-containing equipment.  As a result of the investigation, contractor safety procedures were enhanced and the contractor was disqualified from performing any further work at the facility.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nEmployees are trained to understand the requirements of the Emergency Action Plan.

Both of the suction accumulators are designed to operate at -50 \u00baF @ 14.3 Hg.  A liquid transfer unit (LTU) provides a means of transferring excess ammonia liquid in the accumulators back into either HPR1 and HPR2 via pump AP5 into the condenser drain (CD) line.\r\n\r\nOnce the LTU liquid level rises to a setpoint, a level sensor opens the three-way solenoid valve, allowing hot gas from the high side discharge of the compressors to drain the liquid in the LTU to the High Pressure Receivers (HPR1 & HPR2).   As the liquid level in the LTU drops, the three-way valve changes position and transfers ammonia vapor back to the Suction Accumulators (SA1 & SA2).\r\n\r\nLow stage suction (LSS) vapor from LRP1 and LRP2 is discharged into the suction accumulators.

The system high stage suction level is set at 0 \u00baF @ 15.7 psig.  The design conditions for the high stage compressors are +10 \u00baF SST, 90 \u00baF condensing.

The compressor is economized with ammonia vapor via a 2 line tapped into the intercooler dry suction line.  The purpose of the economized compressor is to control suction pressure.  Low-pressure vapor for the compressor comes from the booster suction line from the suction accumulator.  Oil cooling for the compressor is by direct liquid ammonia injection into the compressor.  The compressor suction level is set at -45 \u00b0F @ 11.7 Hg.  The design conditions for the single stage compressor are -20 \u00baF SST, +90 \u00baF condensing.

Oil travels with liquid ammonia but does not mix well.  Where the liquid tends to accumulate (such as in a vessel), the oil will separate and fall to the bottom.
