As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility and the Program 3 Prevention Program of the CalARP Program.  The prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  The prevention program is updated as required.\n\n\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the actions this facility will take in the event of an emergency.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders and safe evacuation of personnel on-site.

The Stationary Source\n\n\n\nThe Olam facility is located in the agriculturally productive Central Valley in Modesto, California.  The plant is situated at about 90 feet above sea level at the southern border of the city limits of Modesto along Whitmore Avenue.  The land south of Whitmore Avenue (City of Ceres) has been developed for residential use.  The Union Pacific Railroad tracks separate the facility on the west from light industrial businesses.  The Post facility borders the northern property line of Olam and shares the same gated entrance on Whitmore Avenue.  Approximately 40 acres of agricultural land lie to the east, which in turn, are bordered by Morgan Road on the eastern border.\n\n\n\nThe Olam facility, operated since 1958, processes vegetables into a variety of bulk dehydrated and/or frozen products.  The facility operates three shifts throughout the year with some variance depending upon crop availability.  Raw vegetables are trucked to the site and unloaded prior to washing in the wet processing building. Once the vegetables have been washed, they are processed, dehydrated and/or frozen, and packaged.  The frozen vegetables may be re-blended for specific customers, which involves the use of ammonia refrigeration.\n\n\n\nPlant security is provided by a guard located at the main gate entrance to the facility.

The evaporative condensers reject the heat of the system (heat of compression, the refrigeration loads and connected motors) to the atmosphere by evaporation of water and airflow.  The high-pressure vapor condenses to high-pressure liquid.  The ammonia is condensed at a design pressure of 165.9 psig, which results in a high-pressure liquid condition of +90 ?F @ 165.9 psig.

Both of the suction accumulators are designed to operate at -50 ?F @ 14.3\" Hg.  A liquid transfer unit (LTU) provides a means of transferring excess ammonia liquid in the accumulators back into either HPR1 and HPR2 via pump AP5 into the condenser drain (CD) line.\n\n\n\nOnce the LTU liquid level rises to a setpoint, a level sensor opens the three-way solenoid valve, allowing hot gas from the high side discharge of the compressors to drain the liquid in the LTU to the High Pressure Receivers (HPR1 & HPR2).   As the liquid level in the LTU drops, the three-way valve changes position and transfers ammonia vapor back to the Suction Accumulators (SA1 & SA2).\n\n\n\nLow stage suction (LSS) vapor from LRP1 and LRP2 is discharged into the suction accumulators.  The suction accumulator sizing allows for adequate separation of the liquid and vapor.

The first coil is defrosted by air, while the other three coils are defrosted with hot gas.\n\n\n\nThe first pre-cooler coil and the Stage 2 pre-cooler coil use 30 ?F liquid ammonia, while the after-cooler coils use 18 ?F liquid ammonia.\n\n\n\nPackaging Room (SD2, MAU1)\n\n\n\nPackaging Room cooling is supplied by a flooded make-up air unit, which has a dedicated receiver (surge drum SD2) designed to operate at 25 ?F @ 39 psig and an evaporator designed to operate at +10 ?F.  The design temperature for the area to be served is 45 ?F.  Cooling is provided to the Packaging Room, the Hammermill, and the Blending Room.\n\n\n\n \n\nBELT FREEZERS (FF1 & FF2) \n\n\n\nThe Frigo belt freezers or IQF (FF1 and FF2) are comprised of two serpentine coils for transferring heat from the freezer space to the recirculated liquid ammonia as air blows over the coils.  The freezer coils are periodically defrosted using hot gas with water spray capabilities.\n\n\n\nHIGH STAGE COMPRESSORS (HSC1 - HSC5)\n\n\n\nThe five (5) high stage refrigeration compressors are a combination of reciprocating compressors (HSC1 and HSC5) and screw compressors (HSC2, HSC3, and HSC4).  The reciprocating compressors have w"

      "SummaryText": "ater-cooled oil coolers.  The oil cooling for the screw compressors is accomplished by direct liquid ammonia injection (LIC) into the compressor.  The purpose of the compressors is to create a suction that will pull the low-pressure vapor from the intercooler and the air pre-cooler and to compress the vapor to a high temperature and high pressure.  The system high stage suction level is set at 0 ?F @ 15.7 psig.  The design conditions for the high stage compressors are +10 ?F SST, 90 ?F condensing.  The high stage compressors provide hot gas defrost (HGD) via the high side discharge (HSD) lines for pre-coolers and the freezers.\n\n\n\nSWING COMPRESSOR (SWC1)\n\n\n\nThis single-stage, 400 hp screw compressor was added to the system in June 1997 to accommodate the needs of the new Frigo freezer (FF1).  The compressor is economized with ammonia vapor via a 2\" line tapped into the intercooler dry suction line.  The purpose of the economized compressor is to control suction pressure.  Low-pressure vapor for the compressor comes from the booster suction line from the suction accumulator.  Oil cooling for the compressor is by direct liquid ammonia injection into the compressor.  The compressor suction level is set at -45 ?F @ 11.7\" Hg.  The design conditions for the single stage compressor are -20 ?F SST, +90 ?F condensing.  This compressor could be run in AUTO mode in place of LSC1 if LSC1 is down for maintenance service or repair.\n\n\n\nLOW STAGE COMPRESSORS (LSC1 - LSC3)\n\n\n\nThe three (3) low stage (booster) refrigeration compressors are screw compressors.  LSC1 was formerly designated LSC6 until the 2008 freezer expansion project.  New compressors LSC2 and LSC3 were also added to the system in 2008.  The screw compressors use direct liquid ammonia injection (LIC) for oil cooling.  \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to create a suction, which will pull the low-pressure vapor from the low stage evaporators (belt freezers) through the liquid recirculator packages and suction accumu"

The design conditions for the low stage compressors are -50 ?F SST, 10 ?F condensing.\n\n\n\nAn Autopurger periodically removes noncondensibles from the system.  The Ammonia Diffusion Tank is maintained full of water to absorb a system overpressure release from the vessel pressure relief valves.  Emergency E-stop switches are located at the entrances to the Engine Room for emergency shutdown.  Ammonia sensors in the Engine Room and production areas trigger audible/visual notifications.\n\n\n\nOIL POTS (OP1, OP2, OP4)\n\n\n\nThe oil pots provide a means of safely removing accumulated refrigerant oil from the system.  Oil travels with liquid ammonia but does not mix well.  Where the liquid tends to accumulate (such as in a vessel), the oil will separate and fall to the bottom.  The oil pot function is to collect this oil and remove it from the system using a strict valving procedure (see Oil Draining SOP).\n\n\n\nAMMONIA DIFFUSION SYSTEMS (AD & ADP; ADT)\n\n\n\nAmmonia Diffuser (AD) and Ammonia Diffusion Panel (ADP)\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the ammonia diffuser (AD) and ammonia diffusion panel (ADP) is to manually control a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system in the event of an emergency.  By opening valves in the diffusion panel, ammonia will be mixed and absorbed in water in the ammonia diffuser.  The resulting water and ammonia mixture will be drained to the sewer from the diffuser.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Diffusion Tank\n\n\n\nThe ammonia diffusion tank (ADT) has been d to accommodate one pound of ammonia per gallon of water.  The tank capacity is approximately 30,000 gallons and its  is 12'-3\" diameter and 34'-0\" overall height.  Safety relief valves (SRV) at system vessels are piped into a collective discharge piping system, which ultimately discharges to the ammonia diffusion tank in the event of an SRV release.  In the event of a release to the ADT, the ammonia-water solution will be disp"

One system serves the Engine Room and the second system provides ventilation for the remote pump package (LRP1) room.\n\n\n\nThe Engine Room ventilation system consists of two (2) rooftop upblast ventilators, each with a nominal air flow capacity of 30,000 cfm.  One fan is normally energized at all times for continuous ventilation.  The second Engine Room fan will operate once a 150 ppm ammonia vapor concentration (50% NIOSH IDLH: Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) is detected and then signaled to start by the PLC.  The solenoid King Valve and hot gas solenoid valves will also close at 150 ppm.  The fans can also be operated manually using the key switch outside the Engine Room door at the breezeway.  The fans can also be operated when the E-stop is activated.\n\n\n\nThe Engine Room fans are equipped with explosion-proof motors and spark-resistant blades to satisfy National Electric Code requirements for a non-hazardous environment.  At 40,000 ppm ammonia vapor (25% LFL: Lower Flammability Limit), all other electrical equipment, not rated for Class I, Group D, Division 1 under the National Electric Code, must be de-energized.  At 1,000 ppm, an Engine Room detector will shut down the electrical equipment, well below the LFL.\n\n\n\nThe remote pump package (LRP1) room exhaust fan is set for continuous operation.\n\n\n\nDETECTION SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThe ammonia vapor detection system consists of nine (9) sensors total:\n\n\n\nQty.
