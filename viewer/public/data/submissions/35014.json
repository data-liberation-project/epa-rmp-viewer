There have been no chlorine or sulfur dioxide incidents in the most recent Five-Year history period.\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) program that was initiated in 1995 has been maintained current for the past five years. The PSM compliance also demonstrates our compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program Site specific RMP/PSM Implementation Manual issued to the Water and Wastewater Plants are used to manage our compliance program. Key activities have included: \n\no An annual review of  all chlorine, PSM and RMP procedures\no Three Year Refreshed training conducted on May 5 and 6, 2004\no A Process Hazards Analysis conducted on March  1, 2003 \no Self Audits every three years with the last one on May 26, 2004\no A comprehensive Mechanical Integrity program that uses a computer-based maintenance scheduling program\no An annual review and update of the Emergency Response Plan including periodic drills with the Burlington Fire/Rescue Department\n      \nThe supervisor, chief operators and several plant operators will meet several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the RMP/PSM regulation.\n\nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plants have implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\n    The chlorine and sulfur dioxide delivery systems at the plants have been upgraded to vacuum processes over the past 10 years. This process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\n\n? Automatic cylinder valve controls have been installed on chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders to isolate the cylinders is the event of a gas l"

Projects have been initiated to installed chlorine gas scrubbers by December 31, 2004. These scrubbers would capture and neutralized any released chlorine gas rendering it harmless. \n\nThe site?s Emergency Response Plans have been significantly upgraded. In 1998, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication.  Chlorine Response Drills have been routinely conducted since 1998.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Burlington Utility Department has had an active Safety Committee for ten years. The committee meets monthly with representatives from each function and each site.  The committee?s duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. \n\nWithin the Utilities department, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n     Hazard Communications\n\n      Personal Protective Equipment\n\n      Lockout/Tagout\n\n      Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the Utility Department has had a strong safety record with no hazardous material related loss-time accidents over the past three years. We plan to continue our emphasis on safety to maintain and improve our safety performance.\n\nReport by:\n                                                               \nSteve Shoaf, Director of Utilities, City of Burlington\n\nJune 15, 2004"
