Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Evonik CYRO's way of doing business.  Evonik CYRO-Fortier facility is located at the Fortier industrial site, owned and operated by Cornerstone Chemical Company (CCC).  Evonik CYRO-Fortier uses Cornerstone Chemical Company's established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As part of the Fortier site, Evonik CYRO subscribes to the codes established for American Chemistry Council Responsible Care&reg;.\n\n\n\n68.155 (b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Evonik CYRO-Fortier facility consists of a continuous manufacturing plant producing methyl methacrylate (the MMA process).  The process at the Fortier facility that produces a regulated substance is methyl methacrylate.   \n\n\n\nMethyl methacrylate (MMA Process) is used to make many products such as plastics, floor wax and medical devices.  The regulated substance involved with this continuous operation is hydrocyanic acid (HCN).\n\n\n\n68.155 (c) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n \n\nEvonik CYRO's general accidental release prevention program includes:\n\n\n\n-    EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n\n-    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n\n-    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response\n\n-    Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n\n-    Generally recognized & accepted engineering codes and standards"
