This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar LaPorte.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEquistar LaPorte?s primary activities encompass olefins and polymer and resins manufacturing.  We have the following regulated substance present at Equistar LaPorte; butadiene, butane, 1-butene, ethylene, propylene, isopentane, acetaldehyde, and vinyl acetate monomer.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA using tables and equations has been employed by Equistar LaPorte to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from butadiene storage in the ethylene manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of 3,000,000 pounds of butadiene.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.

The release is assumed to result from a piping failure.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 55,000 lbs. of 1-butene.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is approximately 0.2 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from vinyl acetate monomer storage in the polymers and resins manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of 2,600 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.4 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 0.26 mg/L.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release from vinyl acetate monomer storage in the polymers and resins manufacturing process.  The release is assumed to result from a piping failure.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 10,000 lbs. of vinyl acetate monomer in 31 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 0.26 mg/L.  \n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEquistar LaPorte has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, (1967 Edition).  A number of processes at Equistar LaPorte are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are "
