Waste material is generally received and shipped by the facility via truck and railcar.\n\n(a) The facility is committed to the safety of it's employees and neighboring community.  Facility personnel receive training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response as provided in the facility's RCRA permit.  Topics discussed to prevent hazards include: site access, inspections, location and operation of emergency response equipment, utilization of existing safety measure (e.g., berms, containment), and the handling of incompatible wastes.  Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and spills; the Reece City Volunteer Fire Department is the primary responder in the event of a release beyond the incipient stage.  \n\n(b) The facility consists of a fuels blending operation (liquids and solids), solvent distillation operation, and a drum tipping operation.  The liquid fuels blending operation consists of eight 20,000 gallon storage tanks, and is interconnected with piping to the drum tipping operation.  Additionally, the solvent distillation operation is interconnected with the fuels blending storage tank farm.  The regulated substances handled include:  Acrylonitrile; Allyl Alcohol; Ammonia (20% concentration or greater); Carbon Disulfide; Chloroform; Methyl Chloride; Methyl Mercaptan; Titanium Tetrachloride; and Vinyl Acetate Monomer.\n\n(c) Following an evaluation of each potential release scenario, the worst case scenario has been determined to be a release of carbon disulfide.  The modeled distance to the endpoint for the worst case scenario is approximately 0.38 miles, potentially involving less than 10 residences.   Each of the regulated substances noted above have been modeled for alternative release scenarios, including carbon disulfide.  The distance to the endp"

Also, as part of the facility's RCRA permit, the facility provides regular employee training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response.  Additionally, the facility attempts to actively manage the processing of RMP chemicals such that these chemicals are maintained below the RMP thresholds.\n\n(e) The facility has not experienced a reportable incident under the criteria established during the past five years.\n\n(f) Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and releases.  Emergency response/contingency plan training includes:  notification of appropriate personnel (company and off-site responder); hazardous material identification; release assessment; control procedures; prevention of recurrence or spread of fires/releases; and incident clean-up.  The facility maintains emergency equipment to use in the event or a fire or release (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), spill control equipment).  The Reece City Volunteer Fire Department, Etowah County Sheriff's Department, and Baptist Memorial Hospital are part of the emergency response plans for the facility and have been provided copies of the facility's contingency plan.\n\n(g) The facility provides refresher employee training regularly that incorporates safe handling practices, hazard prevention, and emergency response.
