The treatment facilities are located on a land area of approximately 39 acres, bounded on the southwest by the Pomona (60) Freeway, on the southeast side by Workman Mill Road, on the northeast side by the San Jose Creek Channel, and on the northwest side by the San Gabriel River.  \n\n\n\nCSDLAC has operated the SJCWRP facility since inception in 1971.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages, from an original capacity of 37.5 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) to the current capacity of 100 mgd.  The wastewater treated at SJCWRP originates mainly from approximately 1,000,000 domestic users in the San Gabriel Valley region; a small fraction is of industrial origin.  Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process with aqueous ammonia addition, chlorination, and dechlorination to yield a tertiary effluent that is suitable for re-use.  Aqueous ammonia (19.5% concentration) is used in the disinfection process. \n\n \n\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY COMPONENTS\n\n\n\nStoring and handling large quantities of aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous situations.  For this reason, SJCWRP follows all industry recommended practices for safely storing and handling these chemicals.  SJCWRP's aqueous ammonia handling processes are subject to the CalARP Program Level 2 Requirements.  SJCWRP's chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the US EPA RMP and to the CalARP Program Level 3 requirements.  These programs require a summary in the RMP of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n  ? Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n  ?

Five-year accident history summary.\n\n  ? Emergency response program summary.\n\n  ? Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\n\n\nCSDLAC's accidental release prevention policy at SJCWRP involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe CSDLAC emergency response policy involves the preparation of Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Consolidated Contingency Plans (HMHWCCP) for handling hazardous materials which are specific for each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program requirements.  The CSDLAC has prepared a HMHWCCP for the SJCWRP for storing and handling hazardous materials, including aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The HMHWCCP has been coordinated with the local response agency, the County of Los Angeles Fire Department (LACFD).  The SJCWRP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia (19.5% concentration) is used to maintain the disinfection limits in the treated effluent.  The aqueous ammonia is provided by delivery truck and transferred via hose to the ammonia storage tanks.  The aqueous ammonia solution is stored in 30 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) design, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code unfired pressure vessels"

The working capacity of each tank is 5,120 gallons, and each tank is provided with a high level alarm, pressure relief valves, and secondary containment.  The aqueous ammonia is then transferred from the storage tanks to dosing locations within the effluent channel and mixed.  Once the aqueous ammonia is mixed with the treated effluent, CalARP regulations no longer apply.\n\n\n\nChlorine used for chlorination at SJCWRP and is received in chlorine trailers and transferred to bulk storage tanks located inside the buildings.  Sulfur dioxide used for dechlorination is also received at SJCWRP in sulfur dioxide trailers and transferred to storage tanks located inside the buildings.  The chlorination systems at SJCWRP consist of two chlorine bulk storage tanks, evaporators, chlorinators, residual analyzers, ejectors, diffusers, chlorine contact tanks, piping and other equipment.  The capacity of each chlorine bulk storage tank is 25 tons; however, the maximum quantity of chlorine present in a tank at any given time is only 18 tons.  In case of a major chlorine leak, the bulk storage tanks and the chlorine tank trailer can be isolated by the emergency shutoff valves located on the piping downstream of the bulk storage tank manway and at the end of the flexible hoses that connect to the tank trailer.  There are emergency shutdown switches (push buttons) located outside each door into the chlorine building, and on the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel located on the mezzanine of the chlorine transfer area.  On the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel, there are individual control switches for each valve.

In addition, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\n\n\nSJCWRP is in compliance with Federal and State PSM requirements.  SJCWRP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements: \n\n  ? Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n\n  ? Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\n\n  ? Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\n\n  ? Performance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n\n  ? Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n  ? Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n\n  ? High level of training of the operators and maintenance staff.\n\n  ? Implementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the awareness of the hazardous and toxic propertie"

As part of the emergency response program, CSDLAC has developed and implemented HMHWCCPs for both facilities for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The HMHWCCPs have been coordinated with the local response agency (LACFD).  The main elements of each emergency response plan are: (1) initial discovery equipment and procedure, (2) response to an emergency, including procedures for immediate action and internal notifications, (3) procedures for external notifications, including coordination with Local Governments, Incident Commanders, (4) incident action plan, including mitigation actions, response resources, (5) implementation of tactical plan, and (6) termination and follow-up actions. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIn 1990, as part of its compliance with the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), numerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified for the storage, handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide as part of the PHAs conducted at the SJCWRP.  The PHAs conducted in 1990 were reviewed in 1997 under the RMPP and PSM Program as part of an update.  In 1999, as part of its compliance with the US EPA RMP and California RMP programs CSDLAC conducted PHA updates for the storage, handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at SJCWRP.  Furthermore, in 2004 and 2009, CSDLAC conducted a PHA on the storage, handling and use of aqueous ammonia at SJCWRP.  ALL recommended actions resulting from these PHAs and PHA Updates have been implemented as required.  \n\n\n\nAs part of the 2014 Five-Year RMP Update and Revalidation, PHA updates were conducted for the storage, handling and use of chlorine, sulfur dioxide and aqueous ammonia.  Based on this review, additional recommended actions have been identified to further improve the safety of chlor"
