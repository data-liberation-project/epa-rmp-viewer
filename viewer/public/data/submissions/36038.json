Are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of\nproper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work\nwith the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire\ndepartment and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for a response to any\nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility information. The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia\nfor sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application\nas a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 224314 pounds in the\nfacility's 2 tanks. The capacities of each of these tanks are 30,000 gallons and 18,000 gallons. \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 140196, which\nrepresents the volume of the strorage tanks at 85% capacity as limited by the design standards\nand company procedures. \n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch\ntransfer hose, with 26636 pounds released over 2 minutes. \n\n4. The accidental release program: the facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating\nto The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment,\nContainers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of\nAgriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and\nhandling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous\nammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or\nsignificant property damage "
