      "SummaryText": "Caviness Beef Packers, Ltd., is an existing beef cattle slaughtering and packing plant located approximately 5 miles southwest of Hereford, in Deaf Smith County, Texas. The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system for cooling and freezing products throughout the plant, which is identified as the stationary source for the purposes of the Risk Management Plan. The plant has had no accidents related to the ammonia refrigeration system in the past 5 years. An accidental release prevention program and emergency response program are in place in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations. All existing OSHA PSM information is incorporated into this Risk Management Plan. No changes to the system itself have been made since mid-2013. This plan update incorporates recent inspection dates.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Cast Release Scenario is taken to be the failure (punctured tank, etc.) of the High Pressure Receiver and associated piping located on the northwest side of the plant building. The release quantity would be 8,679 lb over a period of 10 minutes, using a wind speed of 1.5 m/s, stability class F and rural dispersion, to a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm, results in a distance of 1.7 miles. No passive mitigation is available for this scenario. The estimated residential population within this radius is 83, based on 2010 Census data.\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is taken to be a valve failure either inside or outside the plant building. Valve failure is modeled assuming a ?-inch hole releasing ammonia at 180 psig, resulting in a release rate of 534.8 lb/min. Using average conditions of 3 m/s wind speed, stability class D and rural dispersion, to a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm, results in a distance of 0.4 miles. The overhead door to the refrigeration room is typically open in summer, so passive mitigation is not accounted for. The estimated residential population within this radius is 0, based on 2010 Census data and aerial photography. \n\n\n\nThere are no environmental receptors wit"

The EPA guidance document entitled \"Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\" was used to model both the Worst-Case and Alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place at the plant and includes regular inspections and preventative maintenance of all system components. The program includes operating procedures for startup, normal operation, shutdown and emergency shutdown, inspection and maintenance schedules and identifies responsibilities of key personnel. An emergency response program is in place at the plant. Employee safety training is conducted both during pre-employment orientation and annually thereafter. The program includes procedures for evacuation and notification for all types of emergencies, including accidental ammonia releases, and identifies response actions and responsibilities of key personnel. The emergency response program and procedures have been coordinated with Deaf Smith County Emergency Management. Evacuation drills at the plant are conducted annually."
