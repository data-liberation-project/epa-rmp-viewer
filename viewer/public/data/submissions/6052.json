The ARS for ammonia assumes that a leak occurs in a pipe joint or weld and is released for ten minutes.  The release is estimated to go 0.2 miles until the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm is reached. \n\n6.0  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for either PSM or RMP rules. \n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n> Process safety information is provided to all employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n> In-depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n> Written operating procedures (kept up-to-date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n> Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given annually or upon request.\n> Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n> Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n> A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and computerized documentation.\n> A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\n> A management of change system i"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\n7.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been one accidents/release of ammonia at Beatrice Foods that meet specific EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  This incident resulted in the injury of one employees, but did not result in any on-site deaths, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n8.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nBeatrice Foods has an emergency response plan to ensure that in the event of an emergency the personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release.  Response activities are coordinated with the Denison Fire Department.\n\n9.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nChemical safety is an important part of Beatrice Foods operations.  Beatrice recently conducted an audit of their Process Safety Management program and will be dutifully implementing the recommendations from that audit.  Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for Beatrice Foods."

      "SummaryText": "1.0  INTRODUCTION\n\nA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been implemented at Beatrice Foods for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n> Introduction;\n> Beatrice policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n> Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n> Hazard Assessment;\n> Prevention Program;\n> Five-Year Accident History;\n> Emergency Response Plan; and\n> Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n2.0  BEATRICE FOODS POLICIES TO PROTECT HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Beatrice Foods; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Beatrice Foods is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.\n\n3.0  FACILITY IDENTIFICATION\n\nThe Beatrice Foods facility is located at 2700 Texoma Road in Denison, TX. The facility produces margarine products. The facility uses ammonia for refrigeration and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. The amount of ammonia present in the refrigeration system is approximately 12,500 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  \n\n4.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT - WORST CASE SCENARIOS (WCS)\n\nThe worst-case toxic accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of a high-pressure ammonia receiver.  This vessel is capable of storing 5000 pounds of  ammonia.  EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration tables show that, under the worst-case weather conditions and a 10-minute release period, the worst-case release could travel 1.3 miles downwind until the toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (p"
