FutureFuel is a manufacturer of specialty organic chemical intermediates.  Some of the chemicals manufactured at FutureFuel include: paint and coating additives, intermediates used in plastics and bottle polymers, household detergent ingredients, agricultural products, and bio-based products.  FutureFuel has RMP regulated flammables consisting of ethyl mercaptan, acetaldehyde, a CBI flammable substance , trimethylamine and propylene.  In addition, the facility uses chlorine, oleum (30%), anhydrous hydrogen chloride, formaldehyde, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus trichloride, vinyl acetate and bromine which are RMP regulated toxic substances. \n\n\n\nThe FutureFuel plant site has a long-standing history of protecting the health and safety of employees, the community, and the environment.  This is evidenced through over 20 years of safe operations and excellent environmental stewardship, through our commitment to the principles of Responsible Care&reg;. To protect people, property, and the environment, we use multiple systems-or layers of protection-where one system is designed to backup another system.  The first layer involves accident prevention by identifying and reducing risks during the design and before startup of new manufacturing processes.  The second layer involves operating and mantaining equipment and processes in a manner that reduces risks and minimizes incidents.  The third layer involves maintaining the capability to respond to and control incidents in a timely manner.\n\n \n\nAll RMP covered processes at FutureFuel are regulated as Program 3.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nFutureFuel is committed to a goal of providing a workplace that is free of accidents.  Our record over the past years indicates good progress toward that goal.  There have been no in"

There have been zero incidents with off-site effects.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at FutureFuel.  Because processes at FutureFuel that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFutureFuel has management systems in place which meet the requirements of RMP and ensure full employee participation.   The Plant Safety Council was developed to provide oversight, direction, and coordination of site and department safety programs to ensure safety excellence.  \n\n\n\nFutureFuel encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to extensive information created as part of FutureFuel accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in employee participation plans that address each accident prevention program element.  In addition, FutureFuel has a number of initiatives underway that address process and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include FutureFuel's Leading Indicators Process which is a process for reporting safety concerns and ensuring that such concerns are addressed promptly.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFutureFuel keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information."

The PSI and referenced documents are readily available to employees as part of the employee participation plan.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nFutureFuel has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards before the manufacturing process begins.\n\n\n\nFutureFuel uses a PHA technique that is appropriate to the complexity of the process being studied.  There are four techniques in use at FutureFuel.  These are Check List, What If, What If-Check List, and Hazard and Operability Analysis.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, chemical, and engineering expertise and experience.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.\n\n\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on the relative risk rankings assigned by the PHA Team.  These rankings help ensure  accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for the life of the process.\n\n\n\nAll processes undergo a revalidation PHA at least every five years as long as the process is active.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFutureFuel maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, 6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and prov"

The Operations Superintendent certify these procedures annually as accurate.  The Process Safety Review Committee reviews them at least every five years.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo compliment written procedures for process operations, FutureFuel has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  Each new employee receives basic training in department operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is provided training on process-specific duties and tasks.  This is done through an operator training program or by pairing the new operator with an experienced operator for an appropriate period of time.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they may work independently.  Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nFutureFuel uses contractors to supplement its construction, maintenance and related services workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, FutureFuel has procedures in place to provide contractors information on the hazards in their work area.  In addition, FutureFuel has a process for the selection of contractors and evaluation of their safety performance.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nFutureFuel conducts a PSSR for any new process, new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
