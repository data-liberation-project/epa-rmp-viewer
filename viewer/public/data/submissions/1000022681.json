As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of methane and ethylene.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled release of ethylene or methane.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan as per 29 CFR 1910.38(a).\n\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the system and with the general safety and accidental release program at our plant.\n\nIt is the policy of this facility to devote the time, energy, and capital toward maintaining prevention and response programs appropri"

The facility is located at 1407 Pennsylvania Avenue in South Houston, Texas.  The facility is situated approximately 0.5 miles east of Interstate 45 and 3.5 miles south of Highway 225.\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. utilizes two regulated substances, methane and ethylene.  Each of these chemicals is purchased from an outside vendor as a gas liquefied by pressure and stored onsite in cryogenic vessels.  Facility operators then transfer each chemical from the cryogenic vessel to cylinders of varying s (up to 35 pounds).  During the filling process, a cryogenic pump is used to draw the chemical from the cryogenic vessel to the vaporizer.  At the vaporizer, the liquefied gas is heated and vaporized.  The high pressure gas is transferred to the filling stations to fill the gas cylinders.  The cylinders are stored onsite until they are purchased by a customer.  \n\nMatheson Tri-Gas maintains up to a maximum of 24,500 pounds of ethylene and 15,570 pounds of methane on site at any one time.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility has implemented this Process Safety Management / Risk Management Program to manage the handling of methane and ethylene. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. \n\nIn addition, Matheson Tri-Gas has developed a preventive maintenance program in which the process equipment is inspected on a regular basis. Pressure relief valves are installed on the pumps, vessels, and manifolds, while the cylinders are each equipped with a fusible relief plug. These devices protect the equipment from overpressurization.  The pumps are also equipped with pressure controls that enabl"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a methane or ethylene release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM / RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, methane and ethylene health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM / RMP regulations.\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the storage facility, taking note of unusual conditions.  In the event that a methane or ethylene leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. Quality Manager.  The Quality Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, performed on May 18-19, 2010, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. fa"
