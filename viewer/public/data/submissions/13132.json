      "SummaryText": "I.    Our Facility and the Regulated Substance we Handle\n    This Risk Management Plan has been developed for Heartland Co-op.  Our main\noffice is located in West Des Moines, Iowa but we have anhydrous ammonia storage\nfacilities in 24 locations in central Iowa.  Our policies for each facility and the extent to\nwhich we our concerned with public and employee safety is consistent throughout our\ncompany.\n\nII.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at our Facility\n    Because of the nature of anhydrous ammonia, Heartland Co-op has had\naccidental release prevention programs and emergency response policies, as well as\nemployee safety programs in place as long as we have stored and worked with this\nproduct.  At least annually, our employees attend a safety training session which includes\na review of the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia and a written test to confirm their\nknowledge.  This session is held every spring and often repeated in the fall.  In addition,\nour equipment, storage and application equipment, undergoes an annual inspection, as\nwell as a safety check every time it is used.\n    We have emergency shut off valves and relief valves   on storage tanks.  We\nsupply information to the Local Emergency Planning Commission and to local fire\ndepartments every year.  We invite local fire departments and emergency response teams\nto our facilities so that they are familiar with our plant layout and emergency shut off\nsystems.  \n\nIII.    Worst Case Scenario VS Alternate Release Scenario\n    The worst case scenario that we were required to develop for this Risk\nManagement Plan involved a total release of product from the largest storage tank at this\nfacility.  We would like to point out the unlikely nature of this ever happening.  The tanks\nare welded and tested by professionals on a regular basis.  Across the country, the more\ncommon release is the one we used as an alternate release scenario, which is the failure\nof a transfer hose.  Even transfer hoses are chec"

      "SummaryText": "ked and replaced annually, if necessary. \nIf a transfer hose were to develop a leak, the leak could only take place with an employee\npresent (all valves to the transfer hose are closed, unless product is being transferred by\nan employee).  It would be immediately obvious, and the employee would close the valve\nto the supply hose.  The leak would most likely be a small one, not the diameter of the\ntransfer hose.  Therefore, even the numbers shown in the alternate release scenario are\nexaggerated.  \n\nIV.    Five Year Accident History\n    We have had no tank ruptures in the past five years.  We have also not had any\ntransfer hose failure.\n\nV.    Emergency Response Program\n    As noted above, we annually supply information with regard to our facility and\nour operations to the Local Emergency Response Commission and to the local fire\ndepartment.  We encourage both to visit our facilities to fully understand our operations. \nOur employees are trained in the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nVI.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n    We will document the safety inspections of the storage tanks, transfer hoses, and\napplication equipment.  We will be more active in communications with the Local\nEmergency Planning Commissions and the local fire departments of emergency response\nteams and assuring their knowledge or familiarity with our facilities and the public that\ncould be affected by our operations.  We will consider implementation a policy of\nreducing off-season inventory in several of our storage tanks."
