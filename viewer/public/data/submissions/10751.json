This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safety and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant, located 1 miles west of Cheyenne Wells, Co. off HWY 40 1/2 mile South, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from oil and gas wells. The Ladder Creek Helium Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. It processes approximately 35 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Ladder Creek Helium Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest process vessel containing 57,873 pounds of a propane, ethane mix. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.39 miles. No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accide"

Because processes at the Ladder Creek Helium Plant are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and also to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Ladder Creek Helium Plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Ladder Creek Helium Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, The Ladder Creek Helium Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include a safety committee to promote both process and personal safety. The committee typically has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, and local plant management\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Specific employees within the Ladder creek Helium Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. This information is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets. This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the Ladder Creek Helium Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The Ladder Creek Helium Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant primar"

This analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Ladder Creek Helium Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Ladder Greek Helium Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Ladder Creek Helium Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive initial training in Ladder Creek Helium Plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
