The Genesee County Division of Water & Waste, who owns and operates the facility, constructed a new disinfection facility at ARTP in 2003.  The new facility was constructed to incorporate the latest technology in safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and to accommodate disinfection demands projected for future use.  While the process methodology remains largely the same, sulfur dioxide evaporators were incorporated to increase chlorine removal process efficiency and to minimize the number of tanks required to be \"in-service\" simultaneously.  Other important features incorporated to increase safety in handling of these substances include: 1) Fully enclosed chlorine container storage and handling room.  2) Chlorine scrubber, capacity 2600lbs.  3) Sulfur dioxide scrubber, capacity 2600lbs. 4) Isolated observation corridor for each process room in the facility 5) 24/7 Building surveillance operations 6) Card reader access to all entries to the facility.  The scrubbers are designed to neutralize 30% more chemical than a ton cylinder will hold.  The facility also incorporates:   1) Isolated storage, evaporator, and chlorinator/sulfonator rooms.  The rooms are equipped with independent monitoring alarms for chemical release and fire, automated or manual operation scrubber evacuation systems.  2) All cylinders are equipped with automatic shut off valve systems activated by pressure loss or power failure (fail-closed feature).  All safety systems read at the DCU in the plant control room.  Only one container is \"in-service\" for both disinfection and dechlorination systems at a time.  The ability to draw gas from the ton containers was added for both chemicals to accommodate servicing and maintenance of the liquid feed process equipment. Valve additions were also made to improve "

The general accidental release program incorporates the safety features, Process Safety Management, training and management of change policies to prevent the incidents of accidental release. The Emergency Response Plan (ERP)was developed with the inclusion of and incorporated resources from the ARTP employees, the local fire and police departments, the Genesee County HAZMAT Team, the Genesee County Sheriffs Department, local hospitals, the Genesee County Health Department and the LEPC.  Plant personnel, the Genesee County HAZMAT Team and EPA response personnel from Region 5 met at the plant on 2/20/16 to participate in an exercise of a disinfection building release scenario utilizing new AREA RAE plume detection equipment.
