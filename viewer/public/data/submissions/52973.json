      "SummaryText": "SuperValu Inc's  (\"Supervalu\") Quincy Frozen Distribution Center (DC) is a wholesale food distribution facility serving retail stores and military installations in Florida, Alabama and Georgia. The SuperValu Refrigerated Distribution Center # 080 located at 1400 Gadsden St. in Quincy Florida employs over 100 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhyrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and OSHA regulation under 29 CFR 1910.119  Process Safety Management (PSM). SuperValu's Quincy DC stores and use anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage. SuperValu's Quincy DC has not  experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected employees, residents or the environment. Pursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, SuperValu has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry Standard What-If / Checklist Analysis developed through the international Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the facility, along with corporate personnel and the refrigeration contractors who installed the system as well as expereineced facilitators from an outside engineering firm (PRT).   SuperValu's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventative maintenance programs ( Mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety  reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system. The program also includes specific requireme"

As part of the RMP requirements , SuperValu undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences  of the accidental release of ammonia form the largest vessel in the system. Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. Supervalu is committed to  minimizing the accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Quincy DC. Facility management is involved in the design, operation and maintenance of the system.  SuperValu employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community.  Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at SuperValu should be addressed to SuperValu's Environmental Affairs Department. SuperValu has prepared this RMP in accordance with the requirements imposed by the April 2004 revisions to the RMP regulations."
