Some of these include written operating procedures describing how to execute a task safely, training employees on the procedures that are needed to perform their jobs, training employees how to respond to emergencies, supporting the Waxdale Emergency Response Brigade with, and empowering employees to shut down activities that they believe are unsafe.\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Covered Process\n\nThe Polymer Division stores, transfers and processes one chemical in quantities exceeding the applicable risk management plan (RMP) threshold on EPA's list of regulated chemicals.  Aqueous Ammonia (30% concentration) is used in the manufacture of emulsions.  The bulk storage tank and associated piping is the only area of the plant with more than the threshold amount of aqueous ammonia present.\n\n\nAccident Prevention Program\n \nSome of the safety measures employed by the Polymer Division include: \n \n\u00b7 Documented information pertaining to the equipment, technology and chemicals used in the process.\n\u00b7 A complete Process Hazard Analysis for all affected operations and equipment to identify possible release scenarios and recommendations to mitigate/eliminate such release scenarios.\n\u00b7 Written operating procedures that include startup, normal operations, emergency operation, operating limits and consequences of deviation.\n\u00b7 Early detection systems that include high level alarms and interlocks.\n\u00b7 Mitigation systems that include spill containment dikes, tank pressure rel"

The tank is periodically inspected to monitor the condition of the tank.  The tank is filled under the supervision of a qualified operator, so that the response time to an incident is reduced.\n\n \nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents in the last five years that have resulted in any offsite impacts to people or the environment.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Polymer Division utilizes a fully trained and equipped hazardous material and fire brigade onsite, consisting of employees that work for both JohnsonDivsersey and SC Johnson at Waxdale.  This brigade is equipped to respond to, contain and cleanup chemical spills and to attack structural fires.  In addition to personal protective equipment for routine plant activities, the facility has a fully equipped hazardous material vehicle and both in-plant and outside fire vehicles. The Brigade's training meets OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations' (HAZWOPER) requirements. \n\nThe Brigade also coordinates its responses to plant emergencies with offsite emergency response agencies.  Primary offsite emergency responders include the Mt. Pleasant Fire and Police Departments, the Sturtevant Fire Department and the Racine County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe Brigade regularly trains with the Mt. Pleasant Fire Department.  The plant also periodically participates in full-scale hazardous material response exercises involving the local fire departments. \n\nCoordination of emergency response activities is also facilitated"
