      "SummaryText": "The Butterball Longmont, CO facility is a producer of world class further processed turkey products. Butterball has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68; anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of products in various areas of the facility.  Butterball has developed an implemented an OSHA (PSM) program for its ammonia refrigeration system. At this facility ammonia is catergorized within RMP as Program Level 3.  EPA has stated that if the process is in compliance with their OSHA PSM, thus it is in compliance with RMP Program Level 3.  Butterball's ammonia PSM program has been reviewed and the PSM Elements were found to be in compliance and being implemented for RMP.  Butterball has developed a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  Preventative maintenance procedures have been established within the operating procedures.  Butterball has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), updated on 02/03/09, to ensure that, in the event of an emergency, the facility personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and the proper authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release.  Butterball has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements."
