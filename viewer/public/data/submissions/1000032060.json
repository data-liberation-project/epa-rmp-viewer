      "SummaryText": "SENSIENT COLORS LLC RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nFacility Overview\n\n\n\nSensient Colors LLC St. Louis manufacturing plant produces food, drug and cosmetic colorants; and technical dyes and pigments.  The facility includes chemical reactors, solid/liquid separation equipment, wastewater treatment equipment, and general plant utility systems.  This facility has not been subject to OSHA'a PSM rules based on materials handled.  Low volumes of flammable's are handled at this facility.  Based on the EPA RMP regulation, the St. Louis facility is subject to the RMP regulation due to the handling and usage of 20% oleum (20% sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid)above 10,000 lbs.  A thorough implementation of the RMP program has been conducted.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe oleum stored inside the confines of the Sensient Colors Inc.'s St. Louis plant is contained in a 4,167-gallon storage tank at room temperature.  The storage tank is housed inside an acid isolation room that has restricted access.  A two-foot high curb inside the room will contain a spill of over 7,500 gallons and restricts the surface area of any spill to a pool of 510 square feet.  An exhaust fan rated at 2,000 cubic feet per minute ventilates the room.  An emergency a wet scrubber system ventilates the room and is designed to neutralize acid mists or SOx vapors and then exhaust the air through a 10 inch diameter roof vent.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for a toxic release of oleum at this plant involves the spill of the entire contents of the bulk storage (3,500 gallons).  The SO3 fumes would exhaust through the existing room exhaust fan.  Dispersion of SO3 fumes was modeled using BREEZE HAZ DEGADIS+ software.  Using this software for the above scenario, it was determined that the toxic endpoint is 234.6 feet (0.04 miles), which is within the facility fence line and not impacting neighboring residents.\n\n\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nSince the distance to endpoint of the woest-cas"

This plant also has policies in place, which govern how to respond to a chemical emergency.  These written plans are kept in highly visible locations throughout the plant, and each employee must review them at least once a year or every time they are revised.\n\n\n\nIn the release prevention documents it is clearly stated how spills and containment of spills will be handled for each specific area of the plant.  For each plant section it is stated what mitigation is in place (i.e. dikes, sumps, etc.) to contain a spill in that area. \n\n\n\nThe documents also explain how the spills are to be recovered and treated.  Specific tanks are named for the routing of recovered spill chemicals, and what is to be done with the chemicals once they are recovered. Chemicals will either be reclaimed or reprocessed or neutralized and disposed of.\n\n\n\nFor oleum, the release prevention policy reads, \"Any overflow from this area will be caught in a diked area and neutralized.  In case of a leak in one tank the acid will be pumped into the reactor in Building #7 (if empty) and a truck called to unload the remaining acid.\"\n\n\n\nThe emergency response documents control what will take place in the event of an emergency.  A chain of command is clearly outlined, responsibilities are stated for each group of employees and an evacuation procedure is defined.  Employees are informed of their individual duties such as where to be for a personnel count and when they may return to work or go home.  "

      "SummaryText": "Steps to be taken for a specific emergencies are stated including who is to be notified and their telephone numbers.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an oleum spill, the emergency response policy specifies the distances of evacuation for spills under 1 gallon and for spills of over 1 gallon.  The employee that discovers the spill will call security and notify them that an oleum spill has occurred, where the spill is and how much oleum has been spilled.  Supervision and management will be notified immmediately, and a company representative will report the spill to the local Fire Department, the Local Emergency Response Center, the State Emergency Response Center, the National Response Center, in the event that the spill reaches the public sewer, the St. Louis Metropolitan Sewer District.\n\n\n\nThe oleum spill response plan goes into the further detail by giving the nature of the chemical, its physical and chemical properties, and the potential hazards to personnel and equipment.  The plan also describes first aid procedures and sites of exposure.  The personal protective equipment needed to clean up a spill is listed as well as how to stop and contain the spill.  Finally the plan outlines the procedures for the clean-up and reclamation of the spilled oleum.\n\n\n\nDetailed written operating procedures are maintained for all batch processes.  Step-by-step instructions are given with special safety precautions highlighted.  Emergency, temporary, or ESD procedures do not apply to the batch process since all operating steps only proceed step-wise with ongoing checks of the conditions effecting safety.  All operations are ceased in the event that any unsafe conditions should arise.\n\n\n\nAdditionally with the implementation of the RMP, training has been initiated for operators, and maintenance personnel.  This supplements the existing contractor training programs.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Programs\n\n\n\nAs a result of the RMP activities, Sensient Colors LLC performed analysis to determine wh"

Lab testing determined the thermodynamics at elevated temperatures of all reactions involving the use of Oleum do not create a run-away reaction.  \n\n\n\nThe Oleum storage tank and piping systems are routinely inspected to determine the wall thicknesses at several locations on the tank and critical points of the piping. This program provides assurance that tank and piping failure will not occur due to localized corrosion.  Records of all inspections are maintained on file by Sensient Colors LLC maintenance department."
