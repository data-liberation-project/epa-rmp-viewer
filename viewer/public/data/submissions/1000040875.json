      "SummaryText": "             The Ray L. Sherard Water Treatment Plant is a surface water treatment plant that supplies potable water for the city of Cheyenne Wyoming. The plant is located west of Cheyenne and is a conventional filtration plant. The chlorine storage room of the plant is capable of storing fourteen one ton containers, eight vacuum regulators, four chlorine leak detectors and is serviced by a U.S. Filter RJ 2000 emergency vapor scrubber. This unit is able to neutralize a release from a one ton container. This equipment is used for the safe disinfection of treated water before being sent to the population of Cheyenne. The plant is manned 24 hours a day 7 days a week.\n\n\n\n             The general accidental release prevention program and chlorine specific prevention steps have been outlined in the OSHA PSM rule. There is close attention paid to mechanical integrity or preventive maintenance of equipment, operating procedures, management of change, and startup procedures after a change or shutdown. All aspects of PSM are trained on at least annually with evaluation done by demonstration and observation. All procedures were written with the participation of operations staff. A state of the art leak detection system is in place to notify personnel of a chlorine leak with a plant wide evacuation alarm, and will also start the chlorine scrubber unit. All contractors and frequent visitors are trained on their responsibilities during an emergency.\n\n\n\n             There have been no incidents to report in the last five years.\n\n\n\n             The facility has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated with the local emergency responders, Fire District #2, and F.E. Warren Air Force Base HazMat team. In case of an emergency an operator is to notify 911 who will inturn notify the emergency responders.\n\n\n\n             "
