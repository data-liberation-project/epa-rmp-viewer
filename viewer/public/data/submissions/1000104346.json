In addition to helping ensure safe and reliable operation, the results of this program are used to identify opportunities for system improvement.\n\nEmergency Response Program and Policies\nBIC has implemented an Emergency Action Program, as part of the facilities larger Integrated Contingency Plan, which establishes detailed procedures for addressing potential emergencies including fires, explosions, accidental releases, power failures, natural disasters, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and medical emergencies. The plan designates primary and alternate Emergency Coordinators who are responsible for implementing the plan during an emergency.  The plan also provides for emergency specific training of facility personnel.  Emergency response to potential incidents at the facility have been coordinated with outside agencies.  Site visits and joint training exercises have been conducted with the Milford Fire Department in order to familiarize Fire Department staff with BIC facilities and emergency procedures.\n\nEmergency response steps that may be implemented in the event of a release of isobutane include manual and/or automatic activation of fire suppression systems, shutoff devices, ventilation systems and alarm systems.  Other planned procedural actions range from simple leak repair by maintenance personnel to evacuation and response efforts coordinated with City emergency response officials.

BIC recently enhanced and continues to improve site security measures to further safeguard the facility and LP gas operations via pressure and integrity testing and preventative maintenance on various valves and fittings in the tank farm. BIC over the years has also improved fencing/gates/barriers, video surveillance, and expanded 24-hour security guard presence. BIC plans to replace existing piping, gauges, valves, pressure, and pressure relief valves in the MOAT area with more durable stainless steel materials for the transportation of isobutane and plan."

Employee training is comprehensive, including training targeted to job-specific practices and responsibilities under the covered process, as well as overview and awareness training in the various components of the risk management program.  Training is typically a mix of on-the-job and classroom, conducted and documented by competent and experienced personnel.  Employee understanding and competency is assessed.\n\nAmong BIC's administrative safety programs is the Management of Change Program, which requires a very detailed safety assessment and approval process for any significant change to equipment or safety systems associated with isobutane processing.  BIC's Contractor Safety Program is designed to ensure that contractors, including LP gas delivery drivers, are also trained in relevant BIC operating and safety procedures. BIC conducts a Process Hazard Analysis at regular intervals, and as needed.  This detailed, critical analysis of equipment, procedures, process parameters and potential deviations is used to identify opportunities for incremental safety improvements.\n\nNumerous safety systems and controls have been incorporated into isobutane processing and lighter manufacturing operations.  These include pressure regulators, various excess flow detection and shutoff devices, an extensive gas detection system, several ventilation systems, fire suppression systems and control of potential electrical ignition sources.

This voluntary submission for finished lighter storage is for the benefit of local emergency responders and community awareness.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nBIC has not had a reportable accident in the last five years.  BIC has been manufacturing lighters in the current facility since 1977 without a single incident involving a release of isobutane with on-site or off-site consequences, as described in 40 CFR 68.42 (a).  This is one of many statistics that reflect a continuous corporate commitment to the safety and well-being of BIC employees and the community.  BIC maintains a robust Incident Investigation program that examines even minor non-reportable incidents to ensure that corrective actions are implemented to avoid recurrence.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Policies and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (Program 3 Prevention Program)\nPrevention of accidental releases at the facility is accomplished not only through compliance with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and other Federal and State regulations, but through application of long-standing corporate philosophies and initiatives which help support safe operations.  For example, BIC's strong commitment to product quality results in continuous improvement of our manufacturing operations including state-of-the-art process design, control, and preventative maintenance.  BIC's extensive in-line quality testing of every lighter not only guarantees safe and reliable operation of the product by the consumer, but also provides an additional measure of safety for the manufacturing operations. BIC's corporate commitment to safety and sound environmental management is translated into action by a full-time staff of trained Environmental, Health and Safety (EH&S) professionals. BIC's"

The lighter manufacturing building is bordered by public roads, commercial and industrial properties. Activities include lighter production, engineering and administrative operations.  Production operations at the facility include plastic components manufacture, lighter product assembly, packaging, storage and shipping.  Lighters are filled with a liquefied petroleum gas, primarily composed of isobutane, which is a substance regulated under EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68). The lighter fuel operation is identified as Process 1 within the RMP. Process 1 is a Program Level 3 and consists of the storage and transfer of liquid petroleum gas (LP gas). LP Gas is stored in aboveground tanks located in a secure outdoor tank farm. A liquid transfer system pumps the LP gas through underground pipelines to lighter assembly machines in the building.  The lighter assembly machines are located in specially designed rooms dedicated to lighter assembly.  After assembly, lighters are then packaged and prepared for off-site shipment.  \n\nBIC is also resubmitting the RMP to voluntarily notify of a distinct second process, lighter storage (Process 2). Process 2 is considered a voluntary submission because finished lighters are articles, and therefore exempt from threshold determinations and reporting per 40 CFR Part 68.115(b)(3). Lighters have a specific shape and design which is integral to the function of the device, lighters do not release the regulated substance under normal conditions of storage, and therefore meet the definition of an Article under 40 CFR Part 68.3.  BIC has to store lighters in a warehouse at 500 BIC Drive (Building 4) and at 565 BIC Drive. Lighter storage is a separate pr"
