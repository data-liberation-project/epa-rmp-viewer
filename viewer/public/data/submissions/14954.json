If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel have been instructed and are prepared to work with the  Kent County Emergency personnel, the  Gelena Volunteer Fire Department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary activity at the Massey facility of Royster-Clark, Inc., is the blending and storage of fertilizer for sales to agricultural users (farmers).\n\nAqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia is received by tanker truck, stored, and used from the storage tanks in the production of mixed-grade liquid fertilizer for plant nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia stored at this facility would be 135,000 pounds in 1 - 18,000 gallon tank.  This would be 40,000 pounds of ammonia at the maximum of 30% ammonia content.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of Aqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia from  the 18,000 gallon storage tank in the diked area released as a liquid over a 10 minute period.  The maximum amount released would be 135,000 pounds of Aqua Ammonia which would contain 40,000 pounds ammonia at 30% maximum ammonia content.  The distance to an end point of 200 ppm of ammonia, as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degradis,  is 1.60 miles. The release would affect  105 residents, a recreation area and some commercial operations.  The possibility of this worst case release occurring is extremely unlikely as location personnel regularly inspect and repair as necessary all storage tanks.\n\nb. The alternate release scenario, ba"

The calculated quantity of Aqua Ammonia released would be 1500 pounds which is 450 pounds of ammonia, based on the maximum of 30% ammonia content. The distance to the end point of  200 ppm of ammonia as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degradis - is 0.07 miles.    This is 370 feet and would  affect 15 residents.  The possibility of this alternate release scenario occurring is unlikely as Massey personnel periodically inspect, repair and replace equipment according to industry standard procedure.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release prevention program:\n\nThe Massey facility has implemented the provisions of Aqua Ammonia supplier's recommendations for safe handling of Aqua Ammonia and appropriate OSHA regulations.  Additionally, periodic training in handling, storage and use of Aqua Ammonia is conducted with personnel at this location.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release of Aqua Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or has resulted in any off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThis facility has:\n\na. A written emergency response plan which is incorporated in the written community emergency response plan of  County.\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  \nThis facilities emergency response program has been discussed with and reviewed by the Gelena Volunteer Fire Company.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at all the facilities of Royster-Clark Inc. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the effectivene"
