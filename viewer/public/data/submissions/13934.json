If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Wamego, Fire Department and the Pottawatomie County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to the release to people and the environment. The primary action at the Wamego Anyhdrous Ammonia facility is the storage and distribution of the product to our customers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for the direct application of the product as a plant nutrient. The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 267,750 pounds in or two 30,ooo-gallon storage tanks, the mazimum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck unloading 40,000 pounds. The worst-case release scenarion for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of 133,875 pounds of product over a ten minute period. Thisrepresents the total contents of our largest storage tank. The alternativce release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia is the release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint in both instances would be approximately 2.6 miles. The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Reaquirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia According to U. S. Government and State requirements. There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia at the Wamego facility  hat have caused any deaths, injuries, or property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with Federal and State laws.
