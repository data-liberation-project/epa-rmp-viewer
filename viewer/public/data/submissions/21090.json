      "SummaryText": "The following provides a brief summary of the key components of the Risk Management Program for the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at the El Dorado Energy Facility.\n\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nPursuant to the regulations outlined in the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 459.952 - 459.9542, the Clean Air Act Section 112(r), and Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68, this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted on behalf of El Dorado Energy, L.L.C.  This program is implemented under the Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) of the Bureau of Waste Management (BWM) - Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP).\n\nThe scope of this RMP is based on discussions with the NDEP and the Boulder City Fire Department to ensure that all issues are resolved and to incorporate state requirements.  The aqueous ammonia storage and handling process at the El Dorado Energy facility was identified as the only process that triggers the RMP/CAPP requirements.  This process is covered under Tier B program level 1 requirements.\n\n\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nEl Dorado Energy Facility, located approximately 15 miles southwest of Boulder City, Nevada, is an electric generating station consisting of two combustion turbine generators with a combined maximum nominal gross output of 475 MW.  Both units are only capable of combusting pipeline quality sweet dry natural gas.  They are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction Systems (SCR) units for the control of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions.  These SCRs employ ammonia injection technology which reduces NOx emissions to the targeted level of 3.5 ppmvd (at 15% O2).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP/CAPP Programs.  The aqueous ammonia used is a 28.0% solution of ammonia in water, ammonium hydroxide (CAS Number 7664-41-7).\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system at El Dorado Energy Facility is comprised of"

      "SummaryText": " a single storage tank, pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer where the aqueous ammonia is atomized to concentrations below 20%.  The tank is 16,400 gallons in volume and is equipped with pressure relief valves, flame arrester, temperature, pressure, and level indicators.  The maximum capacity of the tank will be administratively limited to 15,000 gallons.\n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable RMP/CAPP thresholds.\n\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) prepared in support of this RMP utilized the methodologies recommended by EPA and employed the RMP*Comp, Version 1.06 modeling system.  The following release scenario was hypothesized:\n\nRelease Scenario - Worst-Case \n\nThe entire contents of the aqueous ammonia storage tank is released through a failed tank or pipe within the secondary containment berm large enough to contain the entire volume.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions, 1.5 m/s wind speed and a stable (Pasquill F) atmospheric stability class, the ammonia cloud could travel 0.4 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.\n\n\n\n1.4 Summary of the Five-Year Accident History\n\nOnce construction is completed, El Dorado Energy Facility will receive aqueous ammonia onsite in October 1999. There is no accident history for the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system.\n\n\n\n1.5 Summary of the Emergency Response Program\n\nEl Dorado Energy Facility's emergency response plan includes the following core elements:\n\n? Specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of aqueous ammonia\n? Procedures to notify local and public agencies including the Boulder City Fire Department, the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, and the National Response Center as necessary\n? Information on emergency health care\n? Information regarding the emergency response training of employees \n? A list of other federal and state requirements to which "
