The tanks are stored in this area due to the problem with vandalism and meth dealers. The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant each year and we comply with their request for facility if necessary.\n                                                                                                                                                                                          The worst case scenario for our facility would have a toxic gas release of one tank 1,000 lbs with a distance to endpoint of .33 miles and has the potential to affect approximately 1000 residents.\n                                                                                                                                                                                          The employees who work in the ammonia plant are trained in safety information, hazards, operating procedures, and most importantly the maintenance pratices of our anhydrous ammonia plant.  Employees always wear safety goggles and use appropriate gloves when dealing with nurse tanks.  Clean safety water is always present during ammonia operations.  We inspet our facility on a regular basis and make improvements when necessary.\n                                                                                                                                                                                          The excellent training and operation record of our company allows us to report that no injury accidents or property damage has occurred at this st"
