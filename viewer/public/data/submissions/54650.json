This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nQuestar?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  Questar?s Clear Creek Gas Storage Central Facility has coordinated with the Evanston City Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Clear Creek Gas Storage Central Facility is located approximately 12 miles northeast of the town of Evanston, Wyoming.\n\nThe plant operates a low temperature, liquid separation process for the production of `Y Grade? natural gas liquids (NGLs).  These liquids are made of propanes, butanes and heavier hydrocarbons.  Additionally, dehydrated natural gas (methane and ethane) is produced at the facility.  All of these substances are regulated under the RMP program and considered a flammable mixture.  Questar has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.5 miles and qualifies for Program 1 due to the plant?s distance from any public receptors.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nClear Creek Gas Storage Central Facility started operations in March 2000 and has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five (5) years.  There have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA?s General Guidance on Risk Management Programs.  \n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Clear Creek Gas Storage Central Facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is i"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency response including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for all personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post incident clean up requirements.\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\n\nQuestar employees receive training in these procedures as necessary.\n\nEmergency Response Plan is updated as needed."
