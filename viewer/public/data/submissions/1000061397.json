This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the local Fire Department, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and Greenwood County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPresently ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this Carolina Pride Foods in a threshold quantity, for which is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for the Carolina Pride Foods operations.  Due to the characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Carolina Pride Foods is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as conversed in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp (Revision 1.07) was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp (Revision 1.07)) model is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.\n\n\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of "

Carolina Pride Foods is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nCarolina Pride Foods current Emergency Action and Response Plan's main focus, is on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Action and Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public.  The Plan also allows Carolina Pride Foods personnel trained in emergency response operations to respond to an upset or release. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Carolina Pride Foods Emergency Action and Response Plan includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off site effects, the general public will be notified by on site staff and off-site governmental of"
