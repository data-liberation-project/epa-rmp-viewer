The facility is inspected yearly by what we consider two valuable entities. These are the NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources / Department of Water Quality and the NC League of Municipalities. We feel that working closely with these agencies has provided us with the necessary information to continuously adhere to all applicable Federal and State regulations pertaining to chlorine (Cl2). Our training involves local emergency agencies and it is a written policy of PSM of this facility to notify the City of Shelby Fire Department of any release in order for them to respond and investigate.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: \nThe Shelby Wastewater Treatment Plant is a tertiary treatment facility, which treats both municipal and industrial wastewater flows.  The plant is designed to treat a flow of 6.0 MGD.  \n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nOur worst-case scenario is based on a liquid spill and vaporization of a one ton cylinder of chlorine resulting in the total release of product over a ten-minute period at a approximately 1.5 m/sec wind speed.  According to the EPA's RMP Comp., the distance to the end point is 1.30 miles of urban terrain.  This release has the potential to spread to several residental neighborhoods, local golf course and several businesses. The projected population of the effected area is approximately 3,300 people.  However, because of the topographical lay of the land, written procedures that comply with OSHA PSM standards and and training on procedures and scenarios, a release of this magnitude is highly unlikely.  Also items in place such as leak detectors for detection of product less than 1 part per million and a vacuum system that stops the flow of gas immediately and automatically if there is a breac"

      "SummaryText": "h in the chlorine feed lines are benefits to safety. \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nThe alternative scenario is based on a pipe leak with the release of 18 pounds of chlorine over a 60-minute period with a wind speed of approximately 1.5 m/sec.  According to EPA's RMP Comp, the distance to the end point is projected to be 0.10 miles.  This release would not impact area residents.  Due to enforced written procedures, policies, and checklists that comply with OSHA PSM standard and state and federal guidelines a scenario to this effect is extremely unlikely.  Detection systems and automatic shutdown devices are in place to assist with releases.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nThis wastewater facility complies with OSHA 1910.119 regulation for accident prevention rules and other state and federal regulations that are applicable for the safety of its employees and citizens.  For critical operations, which involve chlorine, personnel working in pairs and checklist for such operations along with backup systems create a more competent prevention program.  All accidents that occur at the facility, whether they are chemical related or not, are investigated to prevent the same mistake from occurring and to display a commitment to safety.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThis facility has not had an accidental release during the past five years that has caused injuries, deaths, property or environmental damage.  \n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nAs a part of the enforced written and training procedures at the facility, the Shelby Police and Fire Departments are to be notified of any emergency involving the wastewater treatment plant, chlorinating process or any other emergency involving other chemicals on site.  The Cleveland County Hazardous Materials team is also a part of the response protocol.  Involvement with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and training with local agencies to understand roles and responsibilitie"

      "SummaryText": "s are all items this facility has incorporated into this program.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nThe City of Shelby implemented a preventative maintenance program for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide feed systems.  An annual preventative maintenance is performed on all feed equipment and alarms used by the City of Shelby.  The has vacuum chlorinators/sulfinators  that automatically stop feed if the vacuum is breached.  This facility has a good working and training relationship with the Shelby Fire and Police Departments along with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  With technology advancements the City will continue to evaluate ways to improve safety and operations of its facility; along with ways to reduce inventory of regulated substances.\n\n"
