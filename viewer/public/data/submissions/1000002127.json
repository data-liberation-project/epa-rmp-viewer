Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies                                                                                 We at Jacobson Warehouse Company, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our activities to prevent accidental releases from the storage and distribution processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release were ot occur, emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with the locat Fire Department which provides additional emergency response   expertise.                                                                                                                        2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled                                                                 Our facility's primary activities encompass storage and distribution of chemicals that serve the plastics, polyurethane and dyes and pigments industries.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances, 2,4 toluene diisocyante and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate in various mixtures, are used in the manufacturing of flexible polyurethane foams and other elastomers at customer sites.  (No manufacturing or processing is done at this distribution center).  These materials are located in two separate processes: a bulk storage process which qualifies as a Program Level 2 process: and warehouse storage for drummed material which qualifies as a Program Level 1 process.

The General Accident Release Prevention Program                                                                                                                                                                               Our facility has developed and implemented a prevention program to prevent any accidental releases.  This program incorporates the following elements:  Safety examination, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance and compliance audits.                                                                                                                                                                                      4. The 5 Year Accident History\n - This site has no reportable accidents during the past 5 years.                                                                                                                                                                                       5.

All employees are trained on this plan and that training is documented.  The Emergency Action Plan is available to all employees at all times in the workplace.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nInternal safety audits are done annually.  The most recent audit resulted in items needing corrective actions including securing unused trailer seals and increasing inspections of eyewash, posting lockout/tagout procedures and emergency showers. These corrective actions are currently being implemented.\n"
