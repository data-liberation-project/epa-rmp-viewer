This commitment is demonstrated by our activities to prevent accidental releases from the storage and distribution processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release were ot occur, emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with the locat Fire Department which provides additional emergency response   expertise.                                                                                                                        2.

We have two regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances, 2,4 toluene diisocyante and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate in various mixtures, are used in the manufacturing of flexible polyurethane foams and other elastomers at customer sites.  (No manufacturing or processing is done at this distribution center).  These materials are located in two separate processes: a bulk storage process which qualifies as a Program Level 2 process: and warehouse storage for drummed material which qualifies as a Program Level 1 process.

The 5 Year Accident History\n - This site has no reportable accidents during the past 5 years.                                                                                                                                                                                       5.

All employees are trained on this plan and that training is documented.  The Emergency Action Plan is available to all employees at all times in the workplace.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nInternal safety audits are done annually.  The most recent audit resulted in items needing corrective actions including securing unused trailer seals and increasing inspections of eyewash, posting lockout/tagout procedures and emergency showers. These corrective actions are currently being implemented.\n"
