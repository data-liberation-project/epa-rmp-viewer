Chlorine gas is used for disinfection in the water treatment plant. Quantities handled or stored consist of three 2000 lb. pressurized cylinders with maximum quantity 6000 lbs. The chlorine is furnished by Vopak Cinicinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio. The product is transferred along I 64 to 801 south to US 60 then east to Airport Road to the water treatment plant. The chlorine is normally shipped in 1-ton cylinders aboard a tractor-trailer or tandem truck.\n                      Worst-case release scenarios would be gas release of 2000 lbs. at a release rate of 850 lbs/min.with duration time of 10.0 minutes. Wiith a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec with a distance to endpoint of 5 miles with an estimated residential population within distance to endpoint of 300. Protective actions to be taken will be decided by local officials. The response  time to an incident at this facility  by police,fire and an ambulance should not be over 10 minutes. A evacuation radius of 10 miles was determined through the use of the EPA's Technical Guidance for Hazard Analysis based upon the release of a one -ton cylinder of gaseous chlorine. If necessary police department will use cable override system, to alert the effected area. The evacuation routes will be US 60 east and west, 519 south, 801 north, and 32 north.\n                       Saint Claire Medical Center has the capability of removing contaminants-chlorine-by flushing eyes and washing the contaminated skin area as well as treatment for victims that may have gotten the chemical into their bodies by inhalation.\n                       The alternative release scenarios would be a pipe leak at release rate 1.0 lbs/min. release duration would be 60.0 minutes.
