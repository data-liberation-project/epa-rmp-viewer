Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance eith OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by or LEPC to ensure that they conform to the community plan.

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.

In the event that an accidental relaease should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department, Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, Establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators, however we are also engaged in providing agricultural inputs that include receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area, and Propane for our own use.  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, we include Propane (as well as all crop protectents and petroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during early summer and fall months.  During the balance of the year, little if any product transfer occurs.\n\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a full time employee on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times during use, and thru out the off season when not in use.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is considered to b"

The maximum quantity released is based on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint miles based on EPA's RMP-Comp Program (Version 1.06), as well as possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the LEPC to assist them in their planning.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5 years at this site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual and self closing excess flow valves so our alternatec relese scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose use (off loading transportation equipment). The distance to the endpoint is defined per instructions be EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, our accidental relese program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standards K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Helath Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Additionallu, we conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, breakaway couplers at the risers, emergency shut-off valves, and lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  Finally, we maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel, and have provided and/or participate in safty training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nWe have had no release of Anhydrous Ammonia within the past 5 years that caused death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge h"
