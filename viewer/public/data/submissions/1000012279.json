Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\nTaylor Farms California, Inc. facility has both fixed and portable refrigeration systems onsite. Fixed system is composed of pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, plate frame heat exchangers, evaporative condensers, evaporative cooling coils and diffusion tanks. Portable refrigeration systems are refrigeration trailers, vacuum tubes, compressor skids and falling film water chillers. Refrigeration trailers contain compressors, vessels, vacuum tube coils, and evaporative condensers. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All the pressure vessels and the compressors are protected by safety relief valves against high pressure situations.  There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and mechanical room for alarming. There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and testing and inspection program.\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n2.    Description of Source and Substance Handled\nAmmonia refrigeration system is used for produce precooling, storage and process room cooling, water chilling operations and portable skid or trailer mounted equipment. The total charge for the refrigeration system is appro"

      "SummaryText": "ximately 31,000 LBS.  \nFixed refrigeration system for the facility is composed of north and south systems. These systems are connected to each other but a set of isolation valves allows them to operate separately. Under normal operating conditions these valves are kept closed. Compressors for the north system are skid mounted portable compressors which are moved to Yuma facility during the companyA?s winter operation. Three refrigeration trailers support the vacuum tubes for produce precooling.   These refrigeration trailers are also operate on site during the produce processing season from April through November.\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. \n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\nTaylor Farms California, Inc. maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.  Incident Investigation Program is also in place to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release. \nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.  Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  There are emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system.  Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room.  Personnel will autom"

An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually.  All relief valves at the facility are tied into ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high pressure releases to ambient.\n4.    Emergency Response Program\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures.  The Hazmat Team Chief is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release.  The Hazmat Team Chief will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.  \n5.    Five-Year Accident History\nThere has been one release at this facility resulted in ammonia gas liquid release of approximately 145 lbs. An investigation has been completed and measures have been taken to prevent future releases of this kind.\n6.    Planned Safety Improvements\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the PHA and safety inspection are provided to facility operators. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel.  Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n"
