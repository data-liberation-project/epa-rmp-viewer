Wherever possible refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic). The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and  \ntimely response by trained personnel.\n\n2.0  Tampa Maid Foods and Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nTampa Maid Foods processes and freezes seafood products for global distribution. Approximately 26,843 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at Tampa Maid Foods. A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia from the system. \n\n3.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps.\n\nTampa Maid Foods complies with all rules and regulations that pertain to the safe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia. Specific regulations include: OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule; OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER); OSHA Hazard Communication (HAZCOM); OSHA Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans; EPA Risk Management Plans (RMP). \n\nSpecific prevention steps that have been implemented to increase the safety of operation of the ammonia refrigeration system include: a 180 psi alarm was installed in the engine room to warn of high pressure conditions; a light and bell alarm was installed; the ammonia system is inspected every 2 hours, 24 hours per day; the condensers are oversized to maintain head pressure; ammonia detectors are wired to shut down refrigerant pumps and turn on ventilation fans when ammonia is detected; an e"

The program includes initial and annual training for employees who respond to releases or potential releases. The program includes written procedures for proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat human exposures; procedures for using emergency response equipment and procedures to review and update the plan and ensure that employees are informed of changes. The facility emergency response plan is coordinated with the local fire department annually as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act.\n\n6.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety at Tampa Maid Foods.\n\nFuture plans to improve anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system safety at Tampa Maid Foods include: 1. Development of written procedures for incident reporting system to include near misses. 2. Train operators on the proper position of hand valves for inlet/outlet lines on condensers. 3. Development of written procedures for charging ammonia to the system. 4. Ensure delivery truck personnel review safety procedures. 5. Review with operators proper pump down procedures for evaporator maintenance. 6. Install software and display interface for control and monitoring of ammonia system."
