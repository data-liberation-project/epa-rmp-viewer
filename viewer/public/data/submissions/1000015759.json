      "SummaryText": "Cincinnati Executive Summary of Refrigeration System\n\n\nSingle Stage Critically Charged Configuration\nThis system is a single stage configuration utilizing computerized control for system operation for a critically charged system. There are a total of five screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads. All five compressors operate on a -20A?F recirculator package. The compressors have side ports to maintain a +25 A?F high side trap. There are two separate suction temperatures; a -20A?F low temperature recirculator to maintain freezer rooms and a +25A?F high side trap that maintains dock temperatures and sub cools liquid supplied to the low side. There are sixty-five evaporator units for the heat transfer process inside the rooms and on docks. There are two rooftop mounted evaporative condensers with remote sumps for condensing purposes. There are five heat exchangers used for supplying heat to the subgrade material below the freezer floors. A Hansen auto-purger is used to remove non-condensable materials from the critically charged system. \n\nRecirculator System\nA recirculator system is a combination of components that are used to feed a refrigeration circuit. Refrigerant liquid is pumped via P-1 thru P-4 to various evaporator units AU-1 thru AU-65. In the evaporator the refrigerant changes its state from liquid to saturated liquid, meaning a liquid-vapor mixture. This saturated liquid is drawn back to the appropriate vessel where the saturated liquid is separated into its two parts, liquid and vapor. The natural separation allows the liquid to be re-pumped back to the evaporator units and vapor to be drawn out of the vessel via the compressors. \n\nSingle Stage Compression System\nThe single stage compression system utilizes one or more compressors (C-1 thru C-5) to move the refrigerant vapor from the low-pressure side to the high-pressure side of the refrigeration system. With the use of compressors, refrigerant vapor is drawn from a common suction header (low "

From there the refrigerant vapor is sent to the condensing unit (EC-1 and EC-2) to be transferred to a liquid state.\n\nVapor Side\nCompressors C-1 thru C-5 removes vapor only from both the high temperature recirculator and the low temperature recirculator vessels. Each compressor removes vapor from the low temp recirculator V-3 through the main suction header, as well as vapor from the high temp recirculator V-4 through the side port header. The compressed superheated vapors (hot gas) are discharged through a common discharge header where that vapor is then sent to three different places of the refrigeration process; 1) vapor is sent to condensers EC-1 & EC-2 to be condensed into liquid form, 2) vapor (hot gas) is sent to all air units as a medium to melt the moisture that has frozen onto the evaporator unit coils during the heat transfer process, and 3) vapor is delivered to the under floor heat exchangers. \n\nThermosyphon System\nA thermosyphon system is a means by which an uninterrupted supply of liquid refrigerant can be supplied to the necessary refrigeration components via the use of natural convection. The main purpose of the thermosyphon receiver V-1 is to remove heat from the oil in the compressors C-1 thru C-5. Each compressor is equipped with a thermosyphon oil cooler (TSOC) used to remove the heat load from the oil collected beneath the screw compressor in the oil separator (OS). As the heat is transferred from the oil to the liquid refrigerant, the refrigerant becomes saturated with both liquid and vapor. This liquid-vapor mixture creates a density difference between the inlet and the outlet of the TSOC's thus displacing the liquid-vapor mixture back to the thermosyphon receiver via a common header. The difference in density creates a natural circulation within the thermosyphon system. \n\nLiquid Side\nThe liquid supply for the system starts at the conden"

The condensers change superheated vapor discharged from compressors C1 thru C5 by removing heat, a sufficient amount that the ammonia vapor condenses to a liquid form (condenses). This condensed liquid leaves condenser units EC-1 & EC-2 and flows two places; 1) to the auto purger for removal of non-condensables, and 2) to the thermosyphon receiver V-1. The thermosyphon receiver collects the liquid and supplies liquid to three different areas in the refrigeration process; 1) supplies refrigerant for oil cooling purposes on all compressors, 2) supplies refrigerant to auto purger in order to separate non-condensables, and 3) supplies refrigerant to high temp recirculator V-4 (+25A?F). From high temp recirculator V-4, liquid is then supplied to two more different areas in the refrigeration process; 1) liquid is pumped to the +35A?F dock evaporator units (AU 1-3, 37-39, 54-57, 63-65) for cooling purposes, and 2) liquid is transferred to the low temp recirculator V-3 (-20A?F) via float mechanisms and motorized valve groupings. From the low temp recirculator liquid refrigerant is then pumped to the -10A?F & 0A?F freezer evaporator units (AU 4-36, 40-53, 58-62) for cooling purposes.\n"
