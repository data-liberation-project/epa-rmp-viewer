We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including-\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n- The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n2.0     STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces titanium dioxide (Ti02) using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. We produce titanium dioxide, a hiding agent used in paint, paper and plastics, is produced via the chloride process. In the Chloride process, titanium bearing ore, chlorine and petroleum coke are combined to produce titanium tetrachloride. The titanium tetrachloride is subsequently oxidized to titanium dioxide using phosphorus trichloride. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\nHazardous Material\n\nUse at Facility\nChlorine (Cl2)\nProduction of titanium tetrachloride\nTitanium tetrachlori"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n3.1    Worst-case Release Scenarios -- Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe worst-case scenario for chlorine involves the failure of a chlorine storage tank containing 180,000 pounds of chlorine released over a 10 minute time interval. The weather conditions for this release were defined by the EPA. This type of release could result in potential impact to public as well as environmental receptors. Determinations were made using EPA's RMP COMP (tm), version 1.06 and  Land View III (tm) Environmental Mapping Software obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\n3.2    Alternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves release of chlorine from the oxidation reactor over a time interval 10 minutes. The reactor is contained within a building, therefore passive mitigation was used. This type of release could result in potential impact to public receptors. \n\nThe titanium tetrachloride alternative release scenario involves a release from a broken unloading hose over a time interval 5 minutes with complete conversion to hydrochloric gas. No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered for this scenario. This type of release could result in potential impact to public receptors. \n\nThe phosphorus trichloride alt"

No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered for this scenario. This type of release could result in potential impact to public receptors. \n\nNo environmental receptors are impacted by the any of the alternative release scenarios. Public and environmental receptors were determined using United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps. The weather conditions used were EPA defaults.  Determinations were made using Cameo (tm) with Aloha (tm) and Land View III (tm) Environmental Mapping Software obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Cameo (tm) with Aloha (tm) is used by most Local Emergency Planning Commissions (LEPC) for emergency response planning and modeling.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n4.0     GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n- Process safety information (i.e. process technology)\n- Process hazard analysis\n- Operating procedures and safe work practices (including hot work)\n- Training and performance\n- Mechanical integrity\n- Quality assurance\n- Management of change (technology and subtle)\n- Pre-startup review\n- Compliance audits\n- Incident investigation and reporting\n- Employee participation\n- Hot work\n- Contractors (safety and performance)\n- Management of change-personnel\n- Emergency planning and response\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set the way "

      "SummaryText": "we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.0     FIVE- YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nOn November 6, 1996, Edge Moor had an accidental release of approximately 60 pounds of titanium tetrachloride due the overfilling of a tank. There was no off-site impact or injuries as a result of this release.\n\nOn April 29, 1996, Edge Moor had an accidental release of approximately 360 pounds of titanium tetrachloride due a pump failure. There was no off-site impact or injuries as a result of this release.\n\nFor each of these incidents, we have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\n6.0     EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan, which meets all the requirements stated in the RMP rule. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency responders. Our program is detailed in our Edge Moor Emergency Procedure Manual.\n\n7.0     PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAs part of a continual effort to improve safety, reduce environmental impacts and increase the facility's ability to quickly response to emergencies, we intend to perform the following projects:\n\n- Diking of process vessels containing titanium tetrachloride in the production area\n- Integrate chlorine sensors into the plant process control system\n- Redesign relief system for titanium tetrachloride purification area to reduce potential emissions\n- Reduction of fugitive emissions in titanium tetrachloride oxidation area by improvement of existing ventilation syste"
