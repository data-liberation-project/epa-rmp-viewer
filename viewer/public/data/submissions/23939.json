      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn this production facility, Dart Container Corporation of California located at 150 South Maple Street, Corona, California, we handle Isopentane.  This material is considered hazardous by EPA.  Our pentane handling systems are designed with controls to prevent and minimize accidental release.  Written procedures for unloading shipments of pentane, require supervision by specially trained workers.  This allows us to immediately detect equipment failures and prevent dangerous release situations.  Alarms, excess flow devices and automatic shut down systems connected to pentane detectors are part of our spill prevention program.  Our emergency response program is a combination of in house response by our emergency response team whose members are trained for hazardous material handling for pentane, and general fire control, and our local emergency response agencies.  We keep materials and equipment on site, to respond to, and contain accidental spills or releases.  There is a strict no smoking, no flames policy in effect in all areas where pentane is present and the areas are clearly marked with no smoking signs.\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThis facility has several operational areas.  The two areas of concern for this program are the pentane unloading area and the foam sheet extrusion and thermoforming area.\n\nThis facility uses isopentane to manufacture polystyrene foam sheet which is then processed into various end products such as food containers by thermoforming the sheet.  The isopentane is received in rail cars and stored in two 35,000 gallon underground storage tanks.  The isopentane is pumped through two pumping stations directlly to the foam extruders where it is injected into melted polystyrene to form rolls of foam polystyrene sheet.  The maximum amount of isopentane stored on site will be 364,291 pounds.\n\nOther manufacturing activities conducted at this locati"

There is also a small truck maintenance facility to service the semi truck fleet.\n\n3.  The Worst-case Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limti the Distance for Each Reported Scenario\n\n     Worst-Case Scenario - The largest release possible would be loss of the contents of a full rail car.  This would involve 147,716 pounds of isopentane.  It is assumed that the pentane vapors find an ignition source which would result in an explosion.  Using the tables from the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the distance to the endpoint of 1 psi is .42 miles.  This would extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\n     Alternate Scenario - The most extreme alternate scenario would involve a transfer hose failure such as a hose break or coupling being dislodged while the attendant was distracted or called away from the railcar unloading area.  It is assumed that the condition is not found and corrected for 10 minutes allowing a pentane spill up to 15,000 pounds.  The resulting vapor cloud is assumed to find an ignition source which would lead to an explosion.  Using the tables from the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the distance to the endpoint of 1 psi is about .20 miles.  This would extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility has written procedures that are used to ensure the safe handling of isopentane.  There are detailed written procedures for unloading that will limit or prevent spills.  Personnel are trained in safe handling practices for the pentane.  Smoking or open flames are strictly forbidden in areas where flammable materials are likely to be present.  All company employees are trained to respect the flammable and explosive nature"

      "SummaryText": "of isopentane.  This starts with the right to know training on the first day of employment and continues to be reinforced with on the job training.  All visitors and contractors are advised of the hazardous nature of isopentane if they are visiting an area where isopentane is likely to be present.  Signs are used to reinforce the no smoking, no flames warnings for critical areas.  The site has lel detector meters for hydrocarbons which trigger alarms in the event of a release.  The alarms alert personnel to action, to minimize the spill and minimize the hazard potential.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not yet handled isopentane.  The facility has not had a reportable accident in the past five years.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program at this facility is very strong.  We have a team of trained hazmat responders.  The response plan is frequently updated and drills are conducted by the emergency response team frequently.  The local fire department is aware of the hazards at this facility and has visited the site to review emergency response needs.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Imporve Safety\n\nThis facility reviews the emergency plan annually and updates the plan as needed any time hazards change.  All new employees are trained about the emergency plan and all employees are notified when hazards in their work area change.  Our emergency response team will continue to get annual update training and they will be updated any time new hazards are introducted to the site.  We will continue to agressively maintain our emergency preparedness and general safety program."
