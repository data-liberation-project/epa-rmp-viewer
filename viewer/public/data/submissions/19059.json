The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Meredosia Terminal are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Meredosia Fire Dept, Pike and Morgan Co. LEPC's or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of Asphalt, liquid fertilizers, road salt and the reaction of water and Anhydrous Ammonia to form Aqua- Ammonia (a fertilizer).\n\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 12,000 gallons (or 56,078 lbs.) in our fixed storage tank, and 4 x 90,000 gal. Aqua-ammonia storage tanks each having the capacity of holding 297,000 lbs. of ammonia in a aqueous suspension. The maximum quantity handled would be 1,244,000 lbs. of ammonia.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\nWorse-Case:  The worse-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of our Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank  released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,078 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.63 miles, which would encompass an area of 8.34 sq. miles, with the potential of impacting approximately 1,300 souls in the surrounding area.\n We also considered the complete failure of one of the 90,000 gal. aqua-ammonia tanks with the resulting pooling of the released liquid. Our berms and containment would limit the spill to an area of approximately 2.5 acres. With a 99% evaporation in 74.5 min. this would result in a distance to the 200 ppm end poin"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.6 miles, which would encompass an area of 1.13 sq. miles, with the potential of impacting approximately 750 souls in the surrounding area.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydours Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards, Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia (from our fixed sources) in the past five years that: have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damages. \n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has a current Emergency Action Plan ( in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38) in place and has coordinated this program with the Meredosia Fire Dept and with the LEPC's of Pike and Morgan counties.  We train our staff on the elements found in our response program (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120) and have invited the fire department to visit our facility in order to provide them with a working knowledge of our plant's layout and our storage facility. This facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are p"
