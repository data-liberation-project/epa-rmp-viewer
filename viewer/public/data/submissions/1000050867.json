The Water Division is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees.  The Manager of Water Production/Operations and the Principal Civil Engineer are tasked with the implementation of the safety programs and policies at the Valley Pumping Plant.  In addition, the Division has an Accident Review Committee that is responsible for reviewing all incidents and near misses that occur at the facilities.  This group is responsible for collecting all necessary information from employees (and contractors as necessary) regarding a reported incident through interview sessions.  Following the data collection, the Accident Review Committee will meet to hypothesize potential causes and develop mitigation measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe City of Burbank Valley Pumping Plant is located at 2030 North Hollywood Way in Burbank, California 91505.  The ammonia system and the chlorine system were constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is surrounded by chain link fence with access through several gates.  Visitors are permitted to enter the facility by checking in with the operations personnel.  A maximum five one-ton containers and three 150-pound cylinders (10,450 pounds) of chlorine is maintained on site.  A maximum of 2,240 pounds of ammonia is maintained on site.\n\n\n\nThe City of Burbank Valley Pumping Plant disinfection process consists of treating up to 9,000 gallons per minute of pre-treated groundwater from the San Fernando Valley groundwater basin at the North Hollywood Area Superfund site.

      "SummaryText": "rine System\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at the facility is used in the disinfection of pre-treated groundwater from the San Fernando Valley groundwater basin at the North Hollywood Area Superfund site.  The water treatment system uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water.  Chlorination of the water kills the germs that cause such devastating diseases as cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery diseases that have practically disappeared since water chlorination has been extensively practiced.  The chlorine is delivered to the facility in one-ton containers and 150 pound cylinders.  Gaseous chlorine stored in one-ton containers in the chlorine storage room is metered and added to potable supply water in the chlorine feed room using two chlorinators and two injectors, respectively.  The resulting chlorine solution is added to the influent groundwater in a diffuser vault prior to the five million gallon reservoir (forebay) for primary disinfection.  The forebay is used to provide the required chlorine contact time for primary disinfection by free chlorination.\n\n\n\nIn the chlorine storage room at the  Valley Pumping Plant, two one-ton chlorine containers are maintained on-line.  A vacuum regulator-check unit switchover valve allows only one of the containers to feed chlorine at a time. When the switchover valve detects high vacuum from one of the containers, it opens to supply chlorine from the other container. All empty tanks connected to the manifold are replaced with a full tank from the storage area.  This replacement is done by City of Burbank operators using a monorail hoist.\n\n\n\nThe Valley Pumping Plant chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  While connected to the system, two ton container are placed on a scale to allow City of Burbank operators to plan the change out procedure.  The one ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned. The vacuum regulator/heater assembly is placed on the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas is"

The heater is used to ensure that chlorine does not condense.\n\n \n\nThe chlorine gas is pulled from the one ton container to the chlorinators through the vacuum regulator.  The chlorinators are equipped with rotameters to control the flow of the chlorine gas.  After the chlorinator, the chlorine is injected (by the injector) into the water line to create a chlorine solution.\n\n\n\nDetectors in the storage and feed rooms indicate chlorine gas leaks.  The disinfection building is also equipped with an automatic emergency chlorine scrubber system that is capable of neutralizing more than 400 pounds of chlorine vapor (the equivalent of a complete one-ton container failure with an average 20 percent flash-off rate).\n\n\n\nChlorine System:\n\n\n\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are three mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact:  1) chlorine sensors/detectors, 2) alarms, and 3) emergency chlorine scrubber system.  The chlorine sensors that trigger audible and visual alarms at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm are located in the chlorine storage room and the chlorinator room.  Once a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm is detected by the sensors, the chlorine scrubber system is activated which neutralizes gaseous chlorine in the room resulting in a lower chlorine concentration, and an off-site alarm company will alert the local fire department via telephone.\n\n\n\nThe emergency chlorine scrubber is located outside and east of the chlorine storage room.  The system is designed to achieve a flow rate of 3,000 cubic feet per minute and is capable of completely neutralizing more than 400 pounds of chlorine vapor on a once-through basis (equivalent to a complete ton container failure with an average 20% flash off rate).

There are three fuse plugs on each end of the one-ton containers for a total of six.  They are designed to melt, relieving pressure, in the event that the temperature reaches 156-164oF.\n\n\n\nAmmonia System:\n\n\n\nThe Valley Pumping Plant is designed to safely and efficiently treat groundwater.   The ammonia system process takes place in several rooms.  The ammonia storage room safety device consists of a leak detector on the interior wall, a panic button on the interior wall at each exit, and an alarm panel.  The ammonia feed room has a leak detector on the interior wall, and an alarm panel.\n\n\n\nThe disinfection facility is equipped with an alarm and monitoring system intended to minimize potential releases of chlorine and ammonia.  There are several types of equipment status indicators throughout the facility: pressure, temperature, level, vacuum, etc.  These indicators monitor the status of the different devices.  Some status indicators send an alarm to the control panel, others trigger another device to start up or shut off, and some are remote indicators that are monitored on a routine basis during operations.\n\n\n\nThree (3) ammonia leak detectors are operated on 120-volt AC, 60 Hz, 5A power supply.  The detectors are located on the west wall of the ammonia storage room and on the south wall of the ammonia feed room.  Both ammonia leak detectors are electrochemical to detect and provide warning of the presence of ammonia gas in the air.  The detectors are sensitive to ammonia gas at concentrations of 20 ppm by volume, and have double pole, double throw (DPDT) alarm contacts.

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Action Plan Manual, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1. To save lives.\n\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3. To protect the environment.\n\n4. To minimize property damage\n\n\n\nCity of Burbank maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\n\n\nCity of Burbank has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department.
