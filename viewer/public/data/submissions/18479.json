      "SummaryText": "RMP developed by Mallard's Food Products, Inc. for the facility located in Modesto, California.  The program covers anhydrous ammonia used as a refrigerant.  System was built and begun operating in 1995.  Approximately 7,500 lbs. of ammonia are present within the refrigeration process.  This quantity exceeds the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) threshold of 500 lbs and places Mallard's in the Program 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe Mallard's RMP document has been prepared in accordance with CalARP Regulations and with local requirements perscribed by Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Department.  \n\nWorst case and alternative case accidental releases for ammonia and methyl bromide were assessed and modeled.  The scenarios are:\n\nWorst Case:  Loss of entire system charge, approximately 7,500 lbs. of ammonia over a 10-minute period.\n\nAlternative Case:  Valve packing material or pump seal release of ammonia, approximatelyt 198 lbs. released over a 1-hour period.\n\nMallard's developed a schedule for implementing measures to reduce the effects and limit the distances for the reported scenarios.  Planned and implemented changes for improving safety and reducing risk at the Mallard's facility include:  developed written SOPs, documented maintenance procedures, developed a contingency/emergency response plan, improved record keeping, updated Hazardous Materials Business Plan, and currently modifying employee training.\n\nThe Mallard's facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\nMallard's has a written Emergency Response Plan that includes specific actions to be taken by facility employees in response to accidental releases of ammonia.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for coordinating with local agencies responding to accidental releases and informing the public regarding emergency health care.  Written emergency action plans for releases of ammonia are covered in the employee training."
