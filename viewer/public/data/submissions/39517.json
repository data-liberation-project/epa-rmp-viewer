Any incident is investigated to identify and correct the root causes in order to prevent recurrance.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nImprovements to the system include; Automate the deluge system for the ammonia tank and the truck unloading station to activate based on the area sensor detection of ammonia in the atmosphere and initiate a project to eliminate the ammonia transfer pump from the anhydrous to 19% system and thereby eliminate a potential for equipment leaks."

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u00bf\tA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP regulation\n\u00bf\tA summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\u00bf\tAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\u00bf\tA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule\n\u00bf\tAn overview of our emergency response program\n\u00bf\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces Rare-Earth compounds and Aliphatic Polyisocyanate paint additives using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The Freeport plant is located in the Brazosport area, about 50 miles south of Houston, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.  The plant sits on 115 acres, of which 50 are developed.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial\naccidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous) is used in the Rare-Earth process as a raw material stored in a 10,000 gallon storage vessel.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario \u00bf Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\nAmmonia is routinely received by tank-truck, transferred into the 10,000 gallon storage vessel.  The WCS is based on the release of the maximum possible content of the storage vessel in 10 minutes.  The ERPG-2 toxic end-point distance is 2.6 miles as calculated using EPA\u00bfs RMP-Comp version 1.07.  In this case, if and when it occurs, such release will have off-site consequences.  The storage vessel was designed and built per ASME code for pressure vessel with Maximum Allowable Working Pressure of 300 psig.  Typical storage pressure during summer months is 140 psig.  Under our mechanical integrity program the vessel is inspected every 5 years externally, every 10 years internally.  There are 2 pressure relief valves protecting the vessel, each one is serviced and calibrated on annual basis.  Routine maintenance is performed as soon as any deficiencies are found.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \u00bf Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\nThe ARS selected to illustrate a more likely case that can occur and has the potential to reach public receptor is the failure of the 2-inch transfer hose.  The ERPG-2 toxic end-point distance is 0.5 mile as calculated using the EPA\u00bfs RMP-Comp version 1.07.  Our standard operating procedure requires both our operator and the delivery truck driver to be physically present to immediately stop the transfer should a"
