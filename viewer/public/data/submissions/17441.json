Safety is actual a requirement to work at the facility.  Management also considers safety as a business objective.\n\nThe facility is located in Las Vegas, NM.  The one process at the facility uses methanol to yeild formaldehyde.  Formaldehyde is a regulated toxic substance.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involved the release of formaldehyde into a diked area, developing from a mixer seal leak.  The quantity released is 1,000 lbs., at a rate of 10 lbs./min.  The release duration is 100 minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  The topography is urban.  The RMP Comp program indicated a 3.0 mile distance to the endoints.  The estimated residential population within the distance to the endpoint was 26 - 60.\n\nThe alternative worst case release scenario involved the release of formaldehyde into a diked area, developing from a leaking pipe.  The quantity released is 100 lbs., at a rate of 10 lbs./min.  The release duration is 10 minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  The topography is urban.  The RMP Comp program indicated a 1.0 mile distance to the endoints.  The estimated residential population within the distance to the endpoint was 26.\n\nSafety is maintained by training and safe operating practices.  Safe operations at the facility are assured by the use of procedures.\n\nWithin the past five (5) years, the process had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program.  No injuries have been recorded in the past five (5) year period.\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan.  The plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, and information for informing the public, and local agencies responding to accidental releases.  Emergency health care information is found in plant MSDS sheets.  The local fire and police departments will respond to"
