The Emergency Response Plan \n(Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was\ndesigned to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.  To save lives.\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.  To protect the environment.\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe emergency response procedures provide the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and \nMitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation.  \nThis manual is distributed to all plant personnel upon initial employment and is readily available at the facility.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe AmeriCold Logistics Plant #80549 facility is located at 525 S. Kilroy Road in Turlock, California.  The facility is \nSituated  approximately one-third mile south of west Main Street and one-half mile west of Highway 99.  The\nimmediate area is primarily industrial and commercial with sparse residential areas  to all sides\n\nThe facility chills and stores a variety of food products such as vegetables, and poultry.  The facility operates the ammonia\nrefrigeration system to maintain appropriate temperatures for storing these food products.  The facility was originally \nbuilt in 1985. The facility currently covers approximately 19.5 acres.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 13,440 pounds of ammonia for cold storage rooms and process equipment.  The \nmajority of the system is located in the engine room including three low pressure receivers, the compressors, the sub cooler,\nand the purger. The pilot receiver, the high pressure receiver, the heat exchangers, and the condensers are mounted outside \nthe engine room and all evaporative are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas  \n \nC.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility.\n\n1.      In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will Immediately go to the nearest public address system and announce: \"ATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - THERE IS AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION)\". A supervisor in the area will determine whether or not the building must be evacuated.\n\n2. If the building is to be evacuated, the Supervisor will announce over the public address system:\n\"ATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - EVACUATE THE BUILDING.  WE HAVE AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION).  WALK ! DO NOT RUN!\"\n\n3.      The Supervisor on duty will immediately (upon hearing the alarm) call 911 to report the leak and give the address of the facility.  He or she will then evacuate the building.\n\n4.    Employees will begin exiting  the building as per the published evacuation plan, and report to the proper area outside the building for a head count.\n\n5.       All Shift Supervisors will report to their assigned areas and perform a head count.\n\n6.       After a complete head count, each Supervisor will report the results of the head count to the person in charge of the plant. The person in charge of the plant will give the approximate working area for any persons not accounted for to the Fire Chief.\n\n7.    When the alarm is over, the Fire Department will determine the extent of the damage, the clean-up                  \n          procedure and whether or not the shift can be continued.\n\n8.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n         There were several recommendations resulting from the development of the PSM/RMP document including recommendations from the Process Hazard Analysis and Off-Site Consequence Analysis studies. These Teams made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety at the facility. These recommendations are expected to be implemented by May 1999 and are listed as follows: \n\n  Implementation Schedule of Recommended Actions\n\n  R-01   Implement a maintenance program (recertification/replacement) for pressure relief valves. Industry standard     \n             is every five years. Automatically replace any relief valve that unseats.\n\n    R-05   Install ammonia sensors that are more reliable than the currently used Sierra monitors.\n\n  R-07    Have the new ammonia sensors in R-05 that monitor the high pressure side of the system (e.g. in the   \n              engine room) shut the liquid solenoid valve on the high pressure receiver.\n\n  R-08    When the ammonia sensors are installed under R-05, consider placing sensors at the end of the pressure \n              relief headers throughout the system.\n\n  R-09    Implement in the facility maintenance program an annual check of all ammonia sensors. Include in this \n              check a remote shutdown test. Document all testing.\n\n"
