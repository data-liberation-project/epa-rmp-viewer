FMC employees receive regular training in the areas of operations and safety to minimize the potential of a release due to human error.\n\nThis facility is an approximately 10 acre complex with 3 buildings all owned and controlled by FMC in a rural area.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred and stored, and distributed in 1000 gal. nurse tank wagons to our farmer-customers.  The maximum quantity stored at any time is 140,196 lbs. total between 2 6,000 gal. tanks and 1-18,000 gal. tank.  \n\nThe worst case release scenariowould be to have all the ammonia released from the largest tank and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 1.75 miles.  The location of the tank in a rural area would minimize the number of individuals affected in the event of a release.\n\nAs an alternative release scenario, in the event of equipment failure, the amount released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 1.18 miles from the tank.  Again, having an effect on relatively few people due to the low population density of the surrounding area.\n\nWe have instituted procedures for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia as required by OSHA and the Indiana State Chemist into our plan.\n\nWe have not had a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.48 in the last 5 years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is in place and will be updated as needed.  Current personnel have been trained in the procedures of safe anhydrous ammonia handling, and new employees will be trained also.  All emergency response personnel have been trained in the hazards associated wiht responding to an anhydrous ammonia release.\n\nIt is the policy of FMC to remain proactive in the area of accident prevention and minimization of loss in the event of a release.  We will continue to conduct self audits and compliance inspections inspectio"
