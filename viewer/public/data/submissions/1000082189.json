All State/Rivermaid will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the CalARP/RMP/PSM, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with All State/Rivermaid internal review practices, and All State/Rivermaid will maintain the most current versions onsite. Thus, the most current version CalARP/RMP/PSM and related documents and elements maintained onsite may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."

All State/Rivermaid assured no reportable release of ammonia or methyl bromide had occurred during the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nAll State/Rivermaid has written an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that covers accidental ammonia or methyl bromide releases. All State/Rivermaid employees will not respond to ammonia or methyl bromide releases but will evacuate personnel to designated assembly points and wait for emergency responders to arrive. All State/Rivermaid will rely on outside responders from the Mokelumne Rural Fire District and the San Joaquin County HazMat Team for mitigation of releases. The EAP details the steps for required notification of outside agencies and the public and states that the All State/Rivermaid Emergency Coordinator will be in charge until such time as an outside responding agency assumes the Incident Command role. All State/Rivermaid management will oversee evacuation and remain in control until Lodi Fire Department arrives, then Incident Command will be assumed by the senior Mokelumne Rural Fire District official at the scene. The Mokelumne Rural Fire District Incident Commander will be responsible for issuing notices for public evacuation and/or sheltering in place, if necessary. All State/Rivermaid management will be responsible for making initial contact with Mokelumne Rural Fire District via 9-1-1; San Joaquin County Environmental Health Department; CalOES, federal NRC, and any other agencies that need to be contacted. All State/Rivermaid will rely on community responders for medical assistance as necessary.

The fumigation process is done under the supervision of local and state agricultural agencies.\r\n\r\nThe RMP/CalARP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP. Program 2 and 3 facilities are required to evaluate a Worst-Case Release Scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an Alternative Release Scenario. The regulations define a Worst-Case Release Scenario as ...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes. An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\r\n\r\nThis facility has prepared Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration and methyl bromide fumigation processes. These are not summarized herein as recommended by the EPA but are presented in the RMP.\r\n\r\nRelease Prevention Program\r\nThe CalARP/RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention programs and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. All State/Rivermaid has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The All State/Rivermaid ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the systems are equipped with pressure relief valves (PRVs) on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\r\n\r\nOther safety features at the facility include: \r\n\u00bf\temergency shutdown systems\r\n\u00bf\tcom"

      "SummaryText": "i, California. The facility is approximately 0.87 miles east of State Highway 99 and 260 yards south of state Highway 12. The facility is located in an area of Lodi zoned for agriculture, commercial and industrial use. The properties along East Pine Street are predominantly low-density residential housing, commercial buildings, orchards and farmland. \r\n\r\nAll State/Rivermaid receives, processes, stores, packages and ships fruit, primarily cherries and pears. The facility NAICS code is 49312 Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage Facilities. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility's two refrigeration systems: All State Packers and the Rivermaid Trading systems. The All State Packers refrigeration system contains an ammonia inventory of 10,350 pounds. The Rivermaid Trading system contains 15,470 pounds of ammonia. Both systems provide cooling to the cold storage rooms and hydrocooler units. The cold rooms are used to cool fruit brought in from orchards before processing and to store fresh fruit after it has been processed and awaiting shipment. The hydrocooler units are used to cool fruit brought in from the orchards after being harvested.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia inventory in both systems exceed the 10,000-pound threshold quantity and are therefore subject to CalARP Program Level 3 RMP, Federal RMP, and State and Federal OSHA PSM regulations. \r\n\r\nRivermaid Trading also has a methyl bromide fumigation process for fruit destined for export. Methyl bromide is regulated under CalARP and State and Federal OSHA PSM when held in quantities above threshold quantities (TQ). The TQ for CalARP is 1,000 pounds and 2,500 pounds for State and Federal PSM regulations. Rivermaid Trading has a methyl bromide inventory of 1,800 pounds in the fumigation process. This amount exceeds the CalARP TQ, but not the State and Federal PSM TQ. Therefore, the methyl bromide fumigation process is subject to CalARP Program Level 2 requirements. The All State/Rivermaid methyl bromide fumigation process is ma"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAll State Packers and Rivermaid Trading Company (All State/Rivermaid) prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (CalARP/RMP/PSM) in general accordance with State and Federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735, et seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. Finally, both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM standards as defined in CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\r\n\r\nAccidental Response Program and Emergency Response Policies\r\nAll State/Rivermaid prepared the CalARP/RMP/PSM program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Many state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, All State/Rivermaid personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on emergency services provided by the Mokelumne Rural Fire District and the San Joaquin County Hazardous Materials Response team. All State/Rivermaid will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the CalARP/RMP/PSM program.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nAll State/Rivermaid is located at 6011 East Pine Street in Lod"
