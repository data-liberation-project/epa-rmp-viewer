      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response (40 CFR 68.155(a))\n\n\n\nShintech Incorporated (Shintech) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented.\n\n\n\nThese include:\n\n\n\n?  A description of the facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation.\n\n?  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases.\n\n?  An overview of our accidental release prevention program\n\n?  An overview of our emergency response program\n\n?  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nShintech owns and operates a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin manufacturing facility in Freeport, Texas (Shintech FP). Shintech FP consists of three manufacturing units (Plant 1, Plant 2, and Plant 3) that produce PVC resin. Raw materials used in the process are delivered via pipeline, trucks, or railcars. Final products are shipped off site via truck and railcar. Each plant manufactures PVC through a suspension polymerization process. The Shintech FP facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes two RMP regulated chemicals (vinyl chloride and chlorine) in its processes. These chemicals have been identified by EPA as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release. The site qualifies as a RMP Program Level 3"

      "SummaryText": " facility (40 CFR 68.175) and is also a PSM facility under OSHA's rule (29 CFR 1910.119). Vinyl chloride is stored above its established threshold of 10,000 pounds. Shintech has six vinyl chloride spheres and are administratively controlled at 70% capacity. Chlorine is stored in racks of 150 lb cylinders at different locations and each location is considered a process and is subject to off-site consequences analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release and Alternate Release Scenarios (40 CFR 68.155 (c))\n\n\n\nThe EPA RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility. The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n\n\nFor Vinyl Chloride, Shintech uses a worst case scenario of a gas release from one storage sphere at 70% capacity of 6,950,000 lbs. Distance to the endpoint in this scenario is 1.09 miles from the source and would likely affect industrial neighbors. \n\n\n\nAs an alternate release scenario for Vinyl Chloride, Shintech FP uses a gasket leak from a basket strainer that could be isolated from the process. The contents of the piping and strainer vessel would leak forming a Vinyl Chloride vapor cloud which then explodes. The amount leaked to the surroundings would total 1835 lb. The endpoint for this case would be approximately 0.072 miles (approximately 1 city block) and would have no offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for a chlorine gas release is from a 150 lb cylinder where all contents are lost within a 15 minute period. The endpoint for a worst case chlorine release would be approximately 0.8 miles and would likely affect industrial neighbors. \n\n\n\nA more likely alternative release scenario for chlorine would be a gasket leak between a 150 lb chlorine cylinder and a chlorinator. The release would be a low flow event with a total of 60 lb of chlorine released.  Under this scenario, chlorine has an endpoint of < 0.1 miles to a concentration of 8.7 ug/l and would have"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n?  Process Safety Information\n\n?  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?  Operating Procedures\n\n?  Training\n\n?  Mechanical Integrity\n\n?  Management of Change\n\n?  Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n?  Compliance Audits\n\n?  Incident Investigation\n\n?  Employee Participation\n\n?  Hot Work Permit\n\n?  Contractor Management\n\n\n\nShintech Incorporated (Shintech) is designed, maintained, and operated to minimize the possibility of a fire, explosion, or any unplanned sudden or continuous release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water which could threaten human health or the environment. All plants have monitors that alarm in each control room should a release be detected. In addition both contract and site personnel provide time based monitoring of the equipment and systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\n\n\nRecords are kept of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. Within the last five years Shintech FP has not had an accident involving Vinyl Chloride or Chlorine which have had an adverse impact to our plant or the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program (40 CFR 68.155(e))\n\n\n\nThe site maintains a contingency plan which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. To be prepared for potential chemical accidents Shintech communicates and works with Brazoria County Emergency Management and Brazoria County Emergency Planning Committee (BCEPC). Shintech also maintains contracts with vendors or alliances with local industrial facilities to provide services to respond to plant emergencies. In addition, the site works with local governments and is a member of CAER. A detailed S"

Drills are completed on a regular basis. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (40 CFR 68.155(f))\n\n\n\nShintech is continually striving to improve safety.  No specific changes are listed within this Executive Summary. However, we improve safety conditions through use of incident investigation, determining root cause and implementing determined corrective and preventive actions.\n\n"
