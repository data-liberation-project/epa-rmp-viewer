These requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A through H. Under the \r\nARP program, processes with chemical quantities on site exceeding the listed threshold quantities \r\nhave applicable requirements. The Sistersville plant has a long-standing commitment to worker \r\nand public safety, and environmental stewardship. This commitment is demonstrated by the \r\nresources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training, and safety in \r\nthe design, installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment. Sistersville has \r\nimplemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of hazardous \r\nchemicals. Should a release occur, trained personnel would promptly respond to control and \r\ncontain the release while coordinating with local emergency responders.\r\nDescription of the Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances \r\nThe Sistersville plant is a silicone chemical producing facility located at 10851 Energy Highway, \r\nFriendly, West Virginia. The plant is situated on approximately 1400 acres in southern Tyler \r\nCounty. An industrial park containing a contract chemical manufacturer, environmental \r\nremediation firm and an aluminum dross-recycling firm to the south, the Ohio River to the west, a \r\nrural residential area to the north and undeveloped forestland to the east occupy the immediate \r\narea surrounding the facility. Silicone chemicals have been manufactured at MPM since the mid-1950s. \r\nThe Sistersville plant makes a variety of silicone products, which fall into three general \r\ncategories: urethane additives, silicone fluids and silanes. The products are utilized in a broad \r\nspectrum of industry. MPM is operated 24 hours a day, seven days per we"
