Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Co-op Country Farmers Elevator Company in Renville, Minnesota  are strongly committed\n\nto employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our\n\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,\n\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our\n\nfacility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\n\nsubstances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Renville Fire Department, which provides\n\nadditional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in two 26,000-gallon tanks, one 25,300-gallon tank, eighteen 2 each 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, nine 1,000-gallon nurse\n\ntanks, and six 1,400-gallon nurse tanks nurse tanks at our facility in Renville, Minnesota (Figure 1). \n\nThe maximum amount stored at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 123,350 gallons \n\n(634,244.5 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage\n\nvessel at our facility contains 113,726.6 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\n\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \n\nlargest single anhyd"

We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the\n\nrelease rate.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a rural topography, the\n\nmaximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.7 miles (Figure 2).  The 2000 Census\n\nthematic map indicated population density of 33-75 persons per 12 sq. miles (Figure 4).  Radius2 x\n\n3.14 = area of circle. 4.7 miles2 x 3.14 x 75 people = approximately5,205 people within 4.7 mile\n\nradius of the site. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\n\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\n\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\n\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \n\n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\n\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\n\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 1.2 miles (Figure 3).
