The City of Sand Springs and its facilities are devoted to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThe SSWWTP is the only City-owned plant used for treating municipal raw sewage.  The plant is capable of handling flows in excess of 2.3 mgd through the process.  Treatment processes use chlorine for the disinfection (inactivation of pathogens) of effluent discharge.  Any residual chlorine is removed from the effluent by dechlorination (or removal of chlorine) with sulfur dioxide.  The chlorination and dechlorination systems are each gas fed under a vacuum and then blended into a water solution.  This feed method minimizes the potential for a Cl2 gas release.  The vacuum feed begins at the regulators, which are mounted directly to the ton containers, eliminating all gas pressure piping in the system.\n\nThe impact areas for both the worst case and alternate release scenarios were based on the results from RMP*Comp.  The worst case release scenario considered a one-ton release within a 10-minute period.  This resulted in a 1.3 mile radius impact area, comprised of an estimated 5,623 persons. \n\nThe selected alternate release scenario for Cl2 was based on a gas release due to a broken or poorly sealed valve on a one-ton container resulting in a release rate of 15 lbs/min. had an impact radius of 0.1 miles.  Since the chlorine process and storage facilities are approximately 0.1 miles from the plant fenceline, then most likely, the impacted population would include plant personnel only.  The City currently has 18 employees at the SSWWTP.    \n\nThe chemical system components at the plant comply with one or mor"

      "SummaryText": "e of the following standards: Chlorine Institute, ASTM Standards, ANSI Standards, and ASME Standards.  In addition, regular maintenance and thorough training sessions for employees will minimize the potential for an accidental release.  This type of release did occur in 1997 and one on-site city employee was injured.  No injuries to other plant employees, responding personnel or offsite injuries were reported.  Since that time, the chemical feed system has been upgraded and additional training has been provided to plant employees. \n\nThe chemical feed system in place at the plant was installed in 1997.  The ton cylinders are currently stored outside.  The City is in the process of minimizing risk by changing to 150-lb chlorine containers and maintaining less than 2,500 lb inventory on hand, below the RMP threshold.\n   \nIn case of a small leak with no potential safety or health hazard, plant personnel would attempt to stop leak wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). If unable to stop the leak, or if the leak is major, City personnel would contact local fire and police departments, Advance Chemical, and plant staff and city personnel, respectively.  Other regulatory agencies would be contacted as required.  The Emergency Planning and Response Team work with plant personnel to minimize the impact of a release by training and initiating drills to verify preparedness in accordance with the county emergency response manual."
