If an accidental release should occur the facility is prepared to work with local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n  -The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers, petroleum, and propane for sale to farmers.\n\n  -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and disturbuted for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release senario\n\n  a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,117 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The endpoint (point of dispertion to 200ppm) is .89 miles.\n\n  b.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .33 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\n  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the U.S. Occupational Safety Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  \n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History\n\n  a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths or injuries.\n\n6.  The emergency response program \n\n  - The facility has:  \n  a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA "

Planned changes to improve safety\n\n  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
