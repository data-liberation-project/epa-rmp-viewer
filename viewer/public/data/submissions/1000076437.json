In CA storage, the temperature and humidity are controlled in order to keep the frozen food in appropriate conditions for human consumption.  \r\n\r\nG&C Foods, Inc. utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in its closed loop mechanical refrigeration plant [ammonia refrigeration system or ammonia refrigeration process]. Whenever the term ammonia appears in this document, it is understood to mean refrigerant grade anhydrous ammonia.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is above applicable thresholds of quantity under the Process Safety Management (PSM/RMP)  and Risk Management Program (RMP)  regulations.  This facility has responded to these federal regulations by developing this PSM/RMP Document, which summarizes the facility's compliance efforts.  Using a systematic approach, the process technology and design, process changes, operational, maintenance and non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans, training programs, and other elements that affect the regulated process have been considered by the facility in its evaluation.  By merging the program requirements as mandated by these two sets of regulations, G&C Foods, Inc. has attempted to achieve concurrent compliance with both the PSM and RMP regulations. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has a number of safety features to prevent the release of ammonia including:\r\no\tRedundancy Systems - for example, if a piece of equipment (e.g., compressor, condenser) fails the equipment will shut-down, and the monitoring system will tell back-up equipment to start-up.\r\no\tState of the Art monitoring system that includes remote observation of refrigeration parameters, 24 hour/7 day remote alarm system.  If equipment shuts-down, the equipment will try to restart, if it cannot restart a message is sent to the primary computer monitoring system and"
