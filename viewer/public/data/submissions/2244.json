      "SummaryText": "The Winter Garden Wastewater Pollution Control Facility (Facility) processes municipal wastewater for residents in the Winter Garden area. The Facility is regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule due to the quantity of liquid chlorine stored (minimum quantity required to be regulated under the RMP rule is 2,500 pounds; maximum of 8,000 pounds is stored at the Facility). The Facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's PSM rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The chlorinator system (utilized to distribute chlorine gas to the effluent for disinfection) is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with Chlorine Institute standards and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) state regulations. Several process controls are utilized to prevent accidental releases of chlorine gas including excess flow valves (terminates chlorine supply should a line break) and fusible metal plugs in the chlorine cylinders to prevent explosions. The Facility's distribution system operates under vacuum so any small leaks or line ruptures will pull in air instead of releasing chlorine. \n\nThe Facility is proactive regarding safety at its facility. The Facility has safety programs in place to prevent accidents, as well as response actions in the event of a chlorine release. The Facility's prevention programs include the following:\n\n7 Risk Management Plan\n7 Process Safety Management\n7 Hazard Communication\n7 Lockout/Tagout\n7 Confined Space Entry\n7 Fall Protection\n\nIn addition, routine maintenance is performed by Winter Garden personnel on all equipment based upon manufacturer recommendations. The maintenance procedures are incorporated in the Facility's daily operations to ensure that all equipment meet or exceed the required specifications. \n  \nTo prepare for an emergency at the Facility, the operators have been trained in the following:\n\n7 Respiratory Protection\n7 Emergency Action and Fire Prevention\n\nThe opera"

      "SummaryText": "tors at the Facility are Florida State Certified professionals. The operators have years of experience safely handling chlorine. They receive updated training regarding operations and safety on an annual basis. In the event of a chlorine release, proactive measures have been coordinated with (1) the City of Winter Garden Fire Department, (2) the Orange County HazMat Team, and (3) the City of Winter Garden Police Department.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario for this facility is a release of chlorine from the failure of a one-ton cylinder. This is unlikely to ever occur and is presented here as required by the RMP regulation. The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire quantity of a one-ton chlorine cylinder is completely released over a period of 10 minutes. According to the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis look-up tables, the distance to toxic endpoint for this quantity of chlorine is 1.3 miles. The Facility is located in an urban area which contains approximately 4,400 persons within the distance to toxic endpoint. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is a more realistic accident that would involve a release of gaseous chlorine from a chlorine line rupture. In this event, the regulator valve on the chlorine cylinder would close shut due to the loss of vacuum. The resulting release would be the quantity of chlorine in the line (maximum of .0028 pounds of chlorine). The distance to toxic endpoint for this quantity of chlorine would be 0.03 miles or approximately 150 feet. The alternative scenario release would effect approximately 2 persons. \n\nThe Facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. In the event of an emergency involving the chlorinator system or the stored chlorine, it is Facility policy to notify 911 (the City of Winter Garden Dispatcher) and request response to the emergency. \n\nCurrently, there are no changes planned for the Facility."
