The facility stores formaldehyde at a stationary source in amounts greater than the RMP thresholds of 15,000 pounds.  A catastrophic release of this substance could impact public receptors; therefore, the facility is regulated by Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving formaldehyde within the past 5 years.\n\nThe facility has performed a worse-case release scenario which estimates a potential loss of 32,500 pounds of formaldehyde which could potentially travel up to 0.3 miles.  In the alternative, the facility has evaluated an 8,160 pound release of formaldehyde which could travel up to 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\nCST's Emerg"

Emergency actions for the facility have been coordinated with the local fire department.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program will be revised as necessary to ensure compliance with applicable RMP regulations and to improve safety.\n\n"
