(DuPont) and IFF announced that they had reached a definitive agreement to combine the DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences (N&B) business with IFF. N&B will remain a part of DuPont until the transaction closes. Pending regulatory approvals, and customary closing conditions, it is expected that the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2021. Until the closing of the intended transaction, N&B is-and continues to be-a business of DuPont regardless of these separation and alignment changes.\r\n \r\nTo prepare for the intended transaction, DuPont is separating its business operations so that the relevant facilities and permits are held by the appropriate DuPont subsidiary that is aligned with either (i) the N&B business; or (ii) DuPont's Electronics & Imaging, Safety & Construction, Transportation & Industrials or Non-core businesses. Until the closing of the intended transaction with IFF, N&B is-and continues to be-a business of DuPont regardless of these separation and alignment changes.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nN&B Midland Site is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the City of Midland Fire Department and Midland LEPC which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nN&B Midland Site is primarily chemical manufacturing, which also include"

For the toxic worst case scenario the selection was based upon the furthest endpoint distance and the greatest impacted receptors.  For the flammable worst case scenario the selection was based upon the furthest endpoint distance and since there are no impacted receptors other variables were considered such as maximum capacities, location/distance to the fence line and predominant wind direction. There are four (4) total alternate cases, one of which is a flammable case.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nN&B Midland Site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable company and governing agency requirements at the time of construction.  Modifications to existing structures are also done in compliance with applicable company standards and governing agency requirements.  Several processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 19 CFR 1910.119.  The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nN&B Midland Site maintains detailed records of safety information that, among other things, describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design associated with all covered processes.

For initial screening and risk evaluation, calculations of The Dow Chemical Fire and Explosion and Chemical Exposure Indices are performed, and a Reactive Chemical and Process Hazard Analysis is conducted.  These methodologies are supplemented when needed with analyses that may include:  What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), Fault Tree Analysis and Safer Technology and Alternative Analysis (STAA).  A team of qualified personnel performs the studies along with experts in engineering and process operations.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, N&B Michigan Operations Site maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.
