Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Accidental Release Program regulations, which governs the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Certain safety precautions must be observed when handling ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to employees and nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, training of our personnel who operate the circuit, and the safety devices inherent in the design of its storage tank.  \n\nOur emergency response program presents a logical coordinated course of action to be followed in case of an emergency. The program utilizes information from the Emergency Response Guidebook by the Department of Transportation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nU. S. Vanadium Corporation produces high quality vanadium products for the steel and chemical industries utilizing vanadium-bearing feedstocks.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a reactant in the crystallization process. Ammonia is received by tanker trucks only and is unloaded into an aboveground-pressurized tank. Liquid ammonia from the bottom of the storage tank is heated through a heat exchanger.  This vaporized ammonia is transferred back into the tank and can then be used in the vanadium process. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the plant site is 70.9 tons. \n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulation"

Five-year accident history. \n\nThere has only been one injury from anhydrous ammonia at this facility in the past five years.\n \n\n5. The emergency response program.\n\nOur emergency response program presents a logical coordinated course of action to be followed in case of an emergency. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  We are active in the Garland County Local Emergency Planning Committee and have a good working relationship with the Morning Star Volunteer Fire Department and Hot Springs Fire Departments."
