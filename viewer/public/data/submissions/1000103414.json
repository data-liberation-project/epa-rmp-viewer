      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nThe Rome Terminal consists of sixteen (16), 30,000 Gallons water capacity tanks. All the storage tanks are mounded. The terminal has two bulkheads designed to load/unload the product from the transports into the storage tanks and vice-versa. The facility has two Compressors. Each propane tanks have excess flow valves, two vapor lines and valves and one liquid line and valves that are above the ground.\n\nWhen unloading liquid propane from the transports, the compressor receives the vapor from the storage tank being filled and passes it through the compressor, then pushes it into the transport, increasing the vapor pressure in the transport. The increased vapor pressure forces the liquid in the transport through the liquid piping to the storage tanks. \nWhen loading transports, compressor receives the vapor from storage tank and passes it through the compressor, then pushes it in the storage tank, increasing its pressure. The increased vapor pressure forces the liquid in the storage tank out through the liquid valves and through the liquid piping to the transport.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policy\nThe same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our operations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. The Facility has Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Supervisor who are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the coun"

The storage tanks are filled only to a maximum of 85% of the total capacity to allow expansion of the product. \n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThough the site is classified as a non-responding facility, it maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP), complying with state of Gerogia regulations. Both plans include procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement, and medical organizations. Notification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel. Should an actual incident occur, the plans five guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site. Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.\n\nThe EAP is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on-site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise. The EAP is based upon the following guidelines and standards:\n\n1.\tNPGA LP-Gas Safety Handbooks: Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and how to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\n2.\tOSHA\u0092s Occupational Safety and Health Standards for General Industry, specifically: 29 CFR 1910.38, \u0093Emergency Action Plans\u0094, 29 CFR 1910.39, \u0093Fire Prevention Plans\u0094, 29 CFR 1910.119, \u0093Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\u0094, and 29 CFR 1910.120, \u0093Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\u0094.\n3.\tNational Fire Protection Association Guidelines, NFPA 58, \u0093Liquified Petroleum Gas Code\u0094 and NFPA 54, \u0093National Fuel Gas Code\u0094.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had an accident or release meeting RMP criteria within the last five years\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility has no plan"

The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst Case Scenario \nFor flammables, vapor cloud explosion is specified as worst case scenario. Worst case scenario is analyzed by estimating distance to an overpressure endpoint of 1 psi resulting from vapor cloud explosion of a cloud containing largest quantity of regulated substance from a vessel or process pipe failure. Per CFR 68.25.b.1, \u0093For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\u0094 is the worst case scenario.\n\nThe greatest amount of propane held is 30,000 Gallons or 110,000 lbs. The total quantity released was 110,000 lbs. The propane was assumed to disperse in the flammable range, encounter areas of sufficient congestion and confinement and result in a vapor cloud explosion.\nUsing EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst case distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.4 miles.\n\nAssumption\nRMP assumes meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario of atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour). Ambient air temperature assumed is 25 deg C (77 deg F). TNT-equivalent model is used which assumes a yield factor of 10 percent.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nFor alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was chosen. The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. The calculated distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\n\nBroken or burst propane loading hoses were determined to be the most common failure. Pumps and Compressors were also considered. Maintenance and mitigation devices are in place that would mitigate the risks of release"
