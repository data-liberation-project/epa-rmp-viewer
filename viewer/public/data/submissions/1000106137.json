All copies of training records are maintained to ensure annual training is provided or as needed. Provisions to train new staff are included in training program. \n\nMaintenance\nThe Olmito WSC WTP properly maintains the equipment by implementing a facility maintenance program.  The maintenance program includes: 1. Employee training in maintenance procedures, 2. procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, 3. inspection and periodic testing programs to identify equipment wear and weaknesses before equipment malfunctions are implemented.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Olmito WSC WTP has scheduled compliance audits every three years of covered processes to ensure the chlorination processes are operating in compliance with RMP requirements. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred in the past five years.  The Olmito WSC WTP provides training to employees on identifying and immediately reporting all incidents requiring further investigation. \n\nEmergency Response Programs\nThe Olmito WSC WTP has prepared a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP Rule and following industry guidelines. This plan has been coordinated with local first responder, the Ranch Viejo Fire Department.  This fire department is a member of the Cameron County Local Emergency Planning Committee."

The key elements are provided in more detail below. \n\nSafety Information\nThe Olmito WSC WTP maintains pertinent documents to ensure the safe operation of process control. Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) outline the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous substances utilized at the facility.\nThe Olmito WSC WTP is operated by TCEQ licensed operators that have obtained chlorination training through both core required courses and via instructor led professionals from the water works industry. The Olmito WSC WTP was designed by a Texas engineering company and plans were submitted through the Texas state regulatory agency with oversite of public water systems, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). This ensured that the treatment and chlorination process was designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices and compliant with Federal and State regulations.  Additionally, the Olmito WSC WTP continuously strives to improve the safety processes to protect our workers, the public and the environment impact. \n\nHazard Review\nThe Olmito WSC WTP has performed a hazard review of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards. The Olmito WSC WTP used checklists to operate and maintain the equipment with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.

      "SummaryText": "Olmito WSC WTP\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Olmito WSC WTP is committed to an accidental release prevention policy that includes a safety program to protect our workers, the public, and the environment.   Our policy emphasizes safety operating procedures to prevent the accidental release of hazardous substances.  Additionally, our emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan so that our personnel and local emergency first response agencies can use to respond to mitigate or control releases.  \n\nFacility Description \nThe Olmito WSC WTP is located at 101 Clara Bennett Dr., Olmito, TX 78575-9774, Cameron County, Texas.  The chlorination building at the facility consists of a triple concrete walled carport type structure. The chlorination building is facing east and is in close proximity to the entrance of the facility.   Four 1-ton chlorine cylinders are stored in the facility.  Two 1-ton cylinders are connected to the system but only one is operational.  In addition, one empty cylinder is kept there.  The system is an automatic switch over vacuum driven system so that when one cylinder is depleted the other cylinder automatically goes into operation. \n\nThe supplier of chlorine makes deliveries by approved US Department of Transportation (DOT) trucks and by shipping product in approved DOT 1 ton metal cylinders.  The facility equipment is designed using technology and standards in accordance with the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute, American Water Works Association, ASME, ANSI, and other applicable codes. \n\nEPA RMP Rule Threshold Substance \nThe chlorine stored and use as a disinfectant in the water treatment process is in quantities above the EPA RMP Rule Threshold Quantity.  The plant regularly has a storage maximum quantity of 3 one-ton cylinders at its chlorination building.   \n\nHazard Assessments\nThe Olmito WSC WTP completed a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substance used in the disinfection processes of the water."
