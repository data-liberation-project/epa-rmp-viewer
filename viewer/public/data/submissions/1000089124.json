      "SummaryText": "1.) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response.\n\n\n\nThe Total Cray Valley - Beaumont Plant has an RMP Policy to assure adherence to applicable Federal, State and Local rules and regulations. The Plant could affect outside receptors and complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard 29CFR 1910.119 and thus falls under Program 3 of the RMP compliance requirements.\n\nThe Facility's Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) or Emergency Response program has been developed and outline in standards, procedures, policies and training. The ICP include procedures for notification of local authorities, regulatory agencies and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled.\n\n\n\nThe Total Cray Valley - Beaumont Plant produces C5 hydrocarbon resins. These resins have many diverse uses.  The covered processes uses RMP regulated substances above the planning threshold.  These substances are Boron Trifluoride, 1,3-Pentadiene, n-Pentane.\n\n\n\n3.) Worst Case Release and Alternate Case Release \n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenarios at this facility would involve either the release of Boron Trifluoride to form a toxic cloud or the release of a flammable liquid forming a vapor cloud that would find an ignition source and produce a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenarios would involve either a slow release of Boron Trifluoride producing a toxic cloud that would be mitigated with water by a water curtain, deluge system and emergency shutdown systems or the release of a flammable liquid forming a vapor cloud producing a vapor cloud explosion that would be mitigated by emergency shutdown systems and fire monitors applying both water and foam to the cloud and resulting fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.) Chemical Accident Prevention.\n\n\n\nThis Facility complies with the PSM Standard. Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) have been conducted on the processes at this Facility. PHAs are also conducted on changes that trigger Management of Chan"
