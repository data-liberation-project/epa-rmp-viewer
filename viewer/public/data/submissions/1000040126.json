      "SummaryText": "a sheared valve with a distance to end point (rural) of 0.4 miles; and (12) ammonia liquid (concentration 20% or greater) process pipe leak releasing 6120# with a distance to end point (rural) of 0.3 miles.  \r\nTo ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or more likely. EPA's RMP CompTM was the release model used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process. Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this EPA submittal. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not taken into account.\r\nGenerally, the Kingsbury Plant components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance with regulatory requirements.   The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride, Anhydrous Ammonia and Methyl Chloride Processes include the following PSM elements: process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; mechanical integrity; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; emergency planning and response.

      "SummaryText": "continuously improving our ability to provide our customers with quality products and services that meet their needs while operating with the highest standards of safety and environmental compliance. To operate with the highest standards of safety and environmental compliance our commitment to EHSS must include: compliance with work instructions and procedures; clear expectations; a constant focus on prevention; active participation; awareness on and off the job; strong leadership; and personal responsibility. Further, a commitment to EHSS must include personal accountability for their EHSS performance and for the EHSS performance of those they manage or supervise. A commitment on the part of all employees and contractors is crucial to achieving the EHSS mission. Compliance with all expectations set forth in the EHSS Charter will help develop the EHSS culture and ensure Carus operates with the highest standards of safety and environmental awareness. These expectations are a key part of job performance assessments. Carus will not tolerate failure to live up to the expectations outlined in this charter, as such failure could negatively impact the health and safety of our employees, our community, and the environment. The EHSS Charter has been reviewed and endorsed by Alexander Chemical Corporation, Kingsbury Plant personnel and plant management demonstrates EHSS leadership and commitment.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to EPA's RMP rule, the Kingsbury plant complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's Hazardous Waste Generator, DHS Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard and DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulatory requirements.   \r\n\r\nThere were six Worse Case toxic release scenarios and twelve Alternate Case toxic release scenarios assessed for the Kingsbury plant.

Incident/Release Notification is an ICP Core Plan Element that includes immediate notification to the La Porte County 911 Emergency Dispatch Center and immediate notification to the La County HAZMAT Director; followed by immediate notification to the National Response Center and regulatory agencies as applicable. These immediate local notifications allow emergency responders and emergency management personnel to provide the community with announcements and warnings related to the incident.  \r\n\r\n The plant has a trained emergency response team comprised of on-site personnel that meets applicable Indiana OSHA and other regulatory requirements. In-plant emergency response team training includes classroom instruction, hands-on demonstrations, and exercises with local first responders including La Porte County HAZMAT Team, La Porte County Sheriff's Department, Porter County HAZMAT Team and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, District 1 Incident Management Team.  Each year two plant emergency response team members attend the Mississippi Fire Academy's HAZMAT Response Training.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, plant personnel are actively involved in emergency planning with community emergency management and response stakeholders including participation on the La Porte County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Board. Alexander Chemical is listed as a resource for both personnel and equipment for incidents involving chlorine, sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, methyl chloride, anhydrous hydrogen chloride and ammonium hydroxide as part of the community emergency response plan. Joint exercises and training are conducted with local first responders including the La Porte County LEPC and La Porte County HAZMAT personnel, and table top exercises with the Cities of La Porte and South Bend, Indiana.

These regional training sessions continue to be held annually. In addition, the Kingsbury Plant provided the personnel and equipment for the American Chemistry Council TRANSCAER Shortline Tour safety/emergency response training for regional first responders. Designated plant personnel are on-call as part of the Chlorine Institute's CHLOREP Sector 9 Response Team.  \r\n\r\nA plant management team representative attends the Chlorine Institute's Annual and Fall Meetings to learn new safety-related developments and best practices involving the safe production, use and distribution of chlorine, sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite, and the distribution and use of hydrogen chloride. In addition, the plant will send a representative to the Chlorine Institute's Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride (AHCl) Emergency Task Group meeting to develop response guidelines for AHCl releases.\r\n\r\nSeveral changes to improve safety and security are planned, budgeted or being implemented including process controls, mitigation systems, monitoring/detection systems, security physical protection systems, hazard reviews/evaluations, contractor management and additional personnel resources. For example, Carus Corporation has created a position for a PSM Specialist to support plants in their PSM activities such as providing audit assistance, process hazard analysis lead/facilitator role, regulatory updates, PSM incident analysis and sharing best practices. Also, this individual provides leadership, culture, and policy guidance to Carus Corporation and Alexander Chemical Corporation management regarding their PSM System."

For example, a rail car of Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride that was connected to the process has been replaced by one tube on a tube trailer connected to the process reducing a worst case scenario release by two orders of magnitude. Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride process controls, monitoring and detection equipment has further controlled exposure to hazards.  \r\n\r\nInfrastructure security improvements at designated areas in the plant have been implemented that provide layers of protection against deliberate man-made incidents in accordance with applicable elements of U.S. Department of Homeland Security's CFATS Risk Based Performance Standards.    \r\nIn the last five years, the Kingsbury plant has had two small quantity accidental releases; a chlorine release on February 2012 that resulted in one injury with no days away from work and no off-site injuries or harm to the environment, and a sulfur dioxide release on February 2013 that resulted in one injury with no days away from work and no off-site injuries or harm to the environment.  \r\n\r\nThe Kingsbury Plant has implemented an Integrated Contingency Plan (One Plan) based on the EPA's Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office guidelines.
