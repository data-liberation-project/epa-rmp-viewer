The emergency response procedures are contained at the front of this plan and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nThis facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil from various field wells.  High pressure gas from the wells is sent to a high pressure separator with the gas being routed to a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the J.T. Unit.  The J.T. Unit strips out NGL liquids which are stored in a 15,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 100 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfer to tank trucks.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in five bulk atmospheric storage tanks (500 barrels each) and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks. The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.\n\nThe facility contains 78,000 pounds of NGL and 115,500 of condensate. The NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss both NGL and condensate which are the specific chemicals contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.  \n\nThe facility has not experienced a release a"
