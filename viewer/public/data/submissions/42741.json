Ontonagon facility produces corrugating medium on two paper machines.  The mill produces the pulp for the corrugating medium from recycle fiber and a carbonate-based semi-chemical pulping process.\n\nDescription of RMP Systems:\nChlorine\nThe mill has a high rate activated sludge wastewater treatment system.  This wastewater treatment system is sensitive to stressors from the mill operations.  Sometimes the stressors result in an imbalance in the microbiological system, generating filamentous organisms.  These filaments in turn create poor settling in the"

      "SummaryText": "final effluent.  To control the filaments (settling rate) chlorine is required.  Chlorine is used from one ton cylinders and is injected into the wastewater treatment process as needed to control the undesirable microorganisms.\n\nThe Ontonagon mill uses water from Lake Superior for all its process water needs.  The intake water is treated with chlorine to prevent biological fouling of process equipment.  Chlorine is used in one ton cylinders and is injected into the intake water as needed to prevent equipment fouling.\nThere will be a maximum of five cylinders connected at any one time.  Four for the wastewater process and one for the intake water process.  This number was determined by the need for chlorine.  Each of the connected cylinders is a separate but identical process.  There could be 20 cylinders (40,000 pounds) on site, connected and in storage, at a time.  In this arrangement a problem as defined by the worst-case release scenario will only involve one cylinder.\n\nAmmonia\nIn an activated sluge wastewater treatment system nutrients are required for the microorganisms to properly digest the contents of the waste stream.  Nitrogen is one of the requried nutrients and it is supplied to the process by feeding ammonia.  \nThe storage tank has a volume of 18,000 gallons.  The maximum volume in the tank is controlled to 15,000 gallons of a 30% solution of ammonia water.\n\nWorsrt-case release scenario:\nChlorine\nThe maximium volume of chlorine that will be in the largest container on site at any one time will be 2,000 pounds.  There can, however, be five of these containers in service at a time.  The arrangement is that each cylinder is a separate but identical process and the worst-case release on any one cylinder will not cause an effect on the other cylinders.  This will result in the worst-case release of 2,000 pounds or 200 pounds per minute.  There are no administrative controls on the chlorine inventory in use at the facility.  There are no passive control measu"

Administrative Controls in place restrict the quantity of ammonia solution in the 18,000-gallon tank to 15,000 gallons.  There are instructions to never fill the tank above the level of 15,000 gallons.  Documentation of the ammonia tank level is recorded on the WWTP daily log sheet.  There are instructions that the ammonia tank level must be below the 45-inch mark before ammonia is ordered.  This level provides for the introduction of a full truckload of ammonia without exceeding the limit of 15,000 gallons (85 inch) control point.  The ammonia tank has a passive containment system around it.  This passive system consists of a concrete secondary containment area that has a surface area of 1041 square feet and will contain all of the ammonia solution with an excess volume of 805 cubic feet.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\nChlorine\nA cylinder is in service with a regulator in place.  The regulator is hit causing the regulator to break off.  This will result in a leak equal to the maximum withdrawal rate from the cylinder.  Release quantity of chlorine will be 23.4 pounds or 0.39 pounds / minute and last for 60 minutes.  Under all conditions of alternative release scenarios there will be no offsite impact from the chlorine system.\n\nAmmonia\nThe hose used by the delivery truck to fill the ammonia tank breaks and releases the capacity of the truck pump.  The amount of material released is 4145 pounds of solution or 1244 pounds of ammonia.  Under all conditions of alternative release scenarios there will be no offsite impact from the ammonia system.  During a filling operation of the ammonia tank there is always a trained driver in attendance and would require only five minutes for the truck pump to be stopped and the valve closed.  There will be a release to the atmosphere for 20 minutes from the puddle formed.\n\nFive-y"

      "SummaryText": "ear accidental release history:\nThere have been no RMP releases of Chlorine or Ammonia within the period of 1994 through February 2005.\n\nAccidental release prevention program:\nChlorine\nThe mill has an OSHA Process Safety Management program in place for chlorine.  This PSM program meets the RMP requirements for a release prevention program.  The Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration conducted an audit of the mill's PSM program on January 4-6, 2005.  There were no recommendations from this audit.  The PSM program was approved as meeting the PSM requirements, and was last updated May 18, 2004.\n\nAmmonia\nAn OSHA PSM program is not required for this process, as ammonia is not on the list of materials requiring a PSM program.  The mill, however, has taken steps to use the knowledge and practices from the Chlorine PSM program to insure the safety of its ammonia process.  \nThe operators are trained in ammonia safety and correct operating procedures.  The operators conduct daily inspection rounds of the WWTP, including the ammonia system, to insure the WWTP is operating correctly.  Any concerns, including safety of the ammonia process, are reported to the maintenance department so corrections can be made.  \nThe maintenance eployees are trained in ammonia safety and how to complete the required work.\n\nGeneral prevention activities:\nThe mill has a staff of experienced and knowledgeable employees that receive refresher training on these systems at least every three years.  Each employee working with chlorine or ammonia has experience in the proper use of personnel protective equipment.  \nEmployees are trained how to change chlorine cylinders  as necessary and check for and correct small leaks that occur occassionally during the cylinder changing process.  If a leak can not be controled by closing the cylinder valve, the Village of Ontonagon Fire Department's hazardous materials (HAZMAT) team will be called to respond to the release.\n\nAny event involving a releas"

In the event of an emergency release which could have possible offsite consequences from the release of chlorine or ammonia the Village of Ontonagon Fire Department will be notified by calling 911.  The Ontonagon Fire Department has been informed of the storage of one ton cylinders of chlorine and the storage tank containing 30% ammonia solution and they have a copy of this Risk Management Program.  \nThese two sources, chlorine and ammonia, are known by and are part of the Ontonagon County's LEPC community emergency response plan.  The WWTP facility has been used by the local fire department's Hazardous Response Team to train and test their efforts.\n\nThe Village of Ontonagon Fire Department is the first call for help if there is a release of chlorine or ammonia and has the necessary equipment and training to respond to a worst-case release of chlorine or ammonia.  The mill has provided equipment to the fire department to contain the release.  Training exercises are occasionally conducted at the mill.  The village fire department is a volunteer unit and many of the members work at the mill.\n\nPlanned improvements to improve safety:\nSmurfit-Stone Container Enterprises, Inc. has implemmented an environmental management system (EMS) to improve the effectiveness of the Ontonagon Mill's environmental programs.  The EMS incorporates procedures for the operation of the wastewater treatment plant including the safe handling of chlorine and ammonia.  Based on Smurfit-Stone Container's excellent compliance record and implemented EMS, the Ontonagon Mill has maintained the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality's Clean Corporate Citizen status since January 1998.  The EMS is reviewed annually at a minimum to identify areas"
