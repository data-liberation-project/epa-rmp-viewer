Facility Policy\n\n     The management and employees of Todds' Elevator are concerned about the safety of the environment in which we live and the neighbors we live with.  If an accidental release should occur we are prepared to work with the local volunteer fire department, the Blaine Co. LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize its effect on people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility information\n\n     The primary activity at this facility is receiving, storing and shipping wheat.  Secondary operations include liquid and dry fertilizers and anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed in 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for direct applications to soils and is used in reacting 10-34-0 polyphosphate liquid fertilizer.\n\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 317,000 pounds in one 12,000 gal. tank which stands alone with a load out station and one 30,000 gal and one 34,000 gal storage tank which are piped together undergraound with manual shutofs at each tank and excess flow valves at each outlet.  Deliveries are made by truck and each unload station has check valves at the liquid connection.\n\n3.  Worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\n\n     a.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest vessel released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 150,000 pounds, which represents 85 percent of the 34,000 gal tank as limited by design standards and monitored by management of inventories.  The distance to end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.21 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternative release scenario would be the release from a break in a transfer hose.  The time of release would more than likely be less than 5 minutes (considering the length of time it would take employees "
