These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup of the process prior to placing the equipment into service.\r\nh.  Compliance Audits\r\nMLI will conduct audits on a regular basis, as stipulated in 40 CFR Part 68, to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulation are being properly implemented in the covered RMP process.  These audits are conducted at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result will be undertaken in a safe and timely manner.  Personnel with expertise in auditing will be utilized to complete the audits.\r\ni.  Incident Investigation\r\nIt is MLI's policy to investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence.  All incident investigation reports are retained for five years.\r\nj.  Employee Participation\r\nMLI believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are encouraged through Safety Committee meetings to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
