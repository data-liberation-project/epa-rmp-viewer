As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, East Kansas Agri-Energy completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nEast Kansas Agri-Energy is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant and anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of East Kansas Agri-Energy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of  anhydrous ammonia or denaturant, it is the policy of East Kansas Agri-Energy to notify the Garnett Fire Department and Anderson County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 634,000 pounds (total pentane is 253,600 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which incl"

      "SummaryText": "udes a secondary containment dike.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 100,800 pounds.  East Kansas Agri-Energy has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to each of  the reportable substances.  Emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. East Kansas Agri-Energy has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, East Kansas Agri-Energy has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.
