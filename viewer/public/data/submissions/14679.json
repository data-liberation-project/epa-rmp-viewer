It is the policy of Super Valu, Inc. to comply with all Federal, State, and Local laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nSuper Valu, Inc. owns and operates a refrigerated perishables warehouse facility at 715 5th Street South Hopkins, Minnesota. This facility uses anhydrous ammonia in a closed circuit charge configuration. The total amount of anhydrous ammonia at the Super Valu Perishables building is estimated at 21,864 pounds. The refrigeration system is operated and maintained by Palen-Kimball, a contractor who specializes in anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario is defined by the EPA RMP Guidance as a failure of the refrigeration system resulting in the release of the entire amount of liquid ammonia (21,864 pounds) in a ten minute period. The liquid ammonia immediately vaporizes once released into the atmosphere. Under these conditions the tables, provided in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration document (EPA 550-B-98-014), indicate the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.7 miles. Based on the current (1997) census data, the population density for Hopkins, Minnesota is 4,048.7 people per square mile. This population density provides the basis for a calculated population of 36,759 people within a 1.7mile radius.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario \n\nThe alternate case scenario is defined by the EPA as a release that is significantly more likely to occur than the worse case scenario.  For Super Valu, Inc. perishables facility, this release is the failure of a one-inch diameter liquid anhydrous ammonia pipeline with a pressure of 60 pounds per square inch. The release"

The tables, in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration document (EPA 550-B-98-014), indicate the toxic endpoint is 0.25 miles. The calculated population within a 0.25 mile radius is 795 people.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough the completion of this RMP, Super Valu, Inc. has complied with all EPA requirements under 40 CFR 68. Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change of management, and incident investigations are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP are conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nSuper Valu, Inc. has not had an accident involving ammonia leading to death, injury, environmental or property damage, evacuation, or in-place sheltering in the last five years at the perishables facility.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nSuper Valu, Inc. has developed an Emergency Response Plan to deal with accidental ammonia releases. In the event of an emergency, it is the policy of Super Valu, Inc. to notify the local (City of Hopkins) Fire Department and to evacuate all employees from the facility.  Palen-Kimball is prepared to respond to accidental releases to the extent allowable under emergency response procedures."
