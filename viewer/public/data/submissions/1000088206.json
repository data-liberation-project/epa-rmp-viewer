Flexsys has an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that establishes clear expectations for immediate response for spills/ other hazardous scenarios of concern. \n\n\n\n(b) STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\n\n\nFlexsys has one chemical, carbon disulfide (CS2), that meets the toxic chemicals TQs, and thus, this substance must be included in a Risk Management Program for its use within the process. CS2 is used as a solvent within the process. \n\n\n\n (c) ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program ensures that regulated substances are safely stored, used, and handled.  In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release.  \n\nFlexsys had been diligent in its completion of the Program 3 Prevention Program requirements that help safeguard the public from accidental releases by:\n\n- Process safety information:  Flexsys compiled written process safety information that is completed prior to conducting any process hazard analysis required by the rule.  This written information enables Flexsys and the employees involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving regulated substances.  Minimum information includes hazards data such as that found on a Safety Data Sheet, technology information, and equipment information.\n\n- Process hazard analysis:  A detailed hazard evaluation has been performed by an experienced team to ide"

The what-if/checklist methodologies were used for determining and evaluating the hazards of the process.  The analysis addressed the hazards of the process. The PHA process requires the review of any previous incident which had a potential for catastrophic consequences. Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards are evaluated and recommendations created if needed. Controls include early warning detections that provide early warning of release. Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, stationary source siting, human factors, and qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls are assessed.  These analyses are being updated and revalidated on a five-year basis.\n\n - Operating procedures:  Written procedures have been developed and implemented to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety information.  Elements that are addressed include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  Operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain a process.  These procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to assure they represent current operating practice.  In addition, safe work practices, applicable to employees and contractor employees, are developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during a variety of plant operations.\n\n - Training:  Initial and refresher training is conducted as appropriate for each employee involved in operating a process.  Flexsys establishes and documents that each employee has received and understood the required training.\n\n - Mechanical Integrity:  Flexsys has developed a comprehensive mechanical integrity program that applies to pressure vessels and storage tanks, pip"

Written procedures, training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, correction of equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are all included in Flexsys' mechanical integrity program.\n\n - Management of change:  Written procedures have been established and implemented to manage changes (except for \"replacement in kind\") to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. The procedures assure that the technical basis for the proposed change, the impact of the change on the environment, safety, and health, the modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change are all addressed.  Appropriate employees and contractors are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the process of affected part of the process.  Updates to the RMP are made if required by the nature of the change.  \n\n- Pre-startup review (PSSR): PSSRs are completed prior to equipment startup.  Such review confirms that prior to introduction of regulated substances to the process that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; for new stationary sources, management of change requirements have been met; and training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed. \n\n- Compliance audits:  Flexsys evaluates compliance with the provisions of this section at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.    A report of the compliance audit findings is developed.  Flexsys promptly determines and documents an appropriate response to each of the audit findings, establishes a schedule for acting on the findings and documents that deficiencies ha"

This investigation shall be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident. A system has been established to promptly address and resolve the findings and recommendations, with documentation of resolutions and corrective actions.  The report shall be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contract employees where applicable, whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings.\n\n - Employee participation:  Flexsys has developed a written plan of action regarding employee participation.  Employees and their representatives are consulted with on the conduct and development of process hazards analyses and on the development of the other elements of process safety management.  Employees and their representatives are also provided access to process hazard analyses and to all other information required to be developed under the rule.\n\n - Hot-work permit:  Flexsys issues a hot-work permit for hot-work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  The permit documents that the fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot-work operations.  The permit further indicates the date(s) authorized for hot work and identify the object on which the hot-work is to be performed.  \n\n - Contractors:  Flexsys and contract-company owners and operators comply with the requirements for contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.  Contractor issues include, among other responsibilities, evaluation of past contractor safety performance and programs, and informing contractors of known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractor's work and the affected processes.  \n\nIn summary, Flexsys is prepared "

Annually a drill is held with the site that involves local volunteer fire departments and Washington County Hazmat. The ICP includes the emergency action plan, emergency response plan, emergency contact information, and other information relevant to emergency planning. Learnings from annual drills are formally documented and kept on file. \n\nThe ICP has specific instructions for notifying state and federal agencies for releases. Annually the ICP is updated to include new information obtained from coordination activities, emergency response exercises, incident investigations, or other available information. \n\nIn-plant emergency response consists of training and planning to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and recover from emergencies.  Those situations identified include hazardous material releases, fire, explosion, floods, severe weather, and terrorism.  A plant incident command system had been established.  This system is designed to be used for all types of emergencies and is applicable to both small releases or minor fires and large-scale disasters.
