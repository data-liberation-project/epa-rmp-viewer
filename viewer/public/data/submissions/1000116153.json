Two entrepreneurs opened Albemarle, Tyrone Plant for business in 1976.  In 1986, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was bought by First Chemical Company of Pascagoula, MS.  First Chemical Company is a subsidiary of First Mississippi Corporation, who was restructured under the name of ChemFirst Inc. in late 1996. Albemarle Corporation purchased the site in July of 2001.  WR Grace purchased the site on June 1, 2021. \n\nThe facility is designed for maximum flexibility and is continuously upgraded to ensure safe operation, minimal waste, and top efficiency.  The site has more than 100,000 gallons of reactor capacity and a complete range of solids handling equipment.  The plant is especially well equipped for complex, multi-step synthesis.  WR Grace, Tyrone Plant's production operations consist of the batch production of specific and finite campaigns to produce chemicals for our customers.\n\nThe facility's Quality and Environmental management systems are ISO 9001 (Quality) and RCMS (Responsible Care Management System) registered.\n\nFACILITY POLICIES FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE\n\nCompany environmental and safety/health policy statements stress the importance of protecting the safety and health of our employees as well as that of the community and the public.  \"The world's natural resources of air, water, and land are finite and must be conserved and protected.  Life and health are precious and must be safeguarded.

These chemicals and their maximum intended inventory levels are: Anhydrous Ammonia, 77,000 pounds; Diethyl Ether 40,000 pounds; and Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride 22,198 lbs.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is a gas delivered by truck and maintained in pressurized tanks.  Diethyl Ether is stored in tanker trucks and PTs (portable tanks).   Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride is received in 600 lb. cylinders.  In addition to minimizing the inventory of these and other chemicals that are needed for our production operations, we also try to remove the chemicals from our site when they are no longer needed for a production campaign.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-case release scenarios have been modeled for Anhydrous Ammonia, Diethyl Ether, and Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride.  An alternative release scenario has also been modeled for each substance as well. Some of the releases have off-site impacts. \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nAlternative release scenarios have been modeled for anhydrous ammonia, ethyl ether, and anhydrous hydrogen chloride.\n\nThe production area is equipped with gas monitors to detect process leaks.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR RELEASE HSITORY\n\nThe facility has had no accidents in the last five years. Our last incident occurred on May 17, 2000. An over pressurization occurred that liberated 750 pounds of hydrochloric acid, which is well under the reportable quantity of hydrochloric acid of 5000 pounds.   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND PREVETNION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWR Grace, Tyrone Plant prevents accidents at the plant by designing equipment for safe operation, installing and maintaining equipment in safe working order, training personnel to operate equipment safely, auditing to check"

Design Codes and standards that are used are a combination of WR Grace, Tyrone Plant requirements, ASME Boiler Codes, NFPA Codes, and other applicable codes and standards.  The Engineering Department reviews the process and generates a short process description and block flow diagram.  It also reviews proposed chemical usage and determines the maximum inventory levels.  The Engineering Department reviews process chemistry and determines the corrosivity of raw materials and reaction mixtures.  They then select the proper equipment, which will withstand the corrosive effect of the various chemicals or mixtures.  The Engineering Department develops relief system design using a computer program and often customer recommendations.  The R&D Department develops material balances for the reactions.

Annually, all employees receive training in their duties under the plan, and the evacuation plan is practiced at least once each year.

These training sessions are often conducted in conjunction with the addition of new equipment and/or a new chemistry to the facility.  WR Grace, Tyrone Plant Emergency Response Teams also conduct training and emergency response drills in conjunction with the City of Tyrone and Blair County response organizations.  The 2023 Blair County Wide drill was conducted at the Tyrone Plant on October 7, 2023.  It involved a hypothetical scenario of a hazardous materials release in a flooded area involving an industrial facility. The exercise tested the response capabilities of the hazardous materials response team, water rescue team, fire department, law enforcement, emergency medical services, and emergency management agencies in mitigating the incident. The scenario also included the participation of facility workers to assist in the response.  In 2017,  the Blair County Will drill at the site involved a catastrophic flammable fire with a structure fire situation in one of the site's process buildings.
