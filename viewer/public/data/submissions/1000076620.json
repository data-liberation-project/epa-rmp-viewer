              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any external portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

In the event an\n\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s),\n\nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending\n\non the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to\n\npeople and the environment.\n\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, establishments primarily engaged in\n\noperating country or terminal grain elevators, however we are also engaged in providing agricultural\n\ninputs that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to\n\nfarmers in our area. The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is #493130 farm product warehousing and storage. Although Anhydrous\n\nAmmonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be\n\nnoted that we also handle Propane for both agricultural uses and home heating, which is under\n\nconsideration as a listed substance. We include Propane (as well as all crop protectants and\n\npetroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during\n\nthe early spring and fall months. During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.\n\nThe maximum Quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is\n"

Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080-hour\n\nrequirement to qualify as a full-time employee on site, therefore item number 1.11 is zero. Time\n\nexpended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\n\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American\n\nNational Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and\n\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n\n(OSHA)standard 29CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. We conduct\n\nannual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous\n\nAmmonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves,\n\nEmergency shut-off valves, Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to\n\nprevent tampering when the site is unattended. We also maintain routine contact with our local fire\n\ndepartment and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety\n\ntraining exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia. We have developed an Emergency Action Plan for\n\nemployees, customers, and visitor's protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and other acts of\n\ngod that initiates evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of\n\nour company including the Anhydrous Ammonia facility included in this plan.
