A primary aspect of this commitment is the White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant system to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \nIn the event of an accidental release, the White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant established a management system headed by the EH & S Training Coordinator to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n2.0  White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule"

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach"

The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Chlorination Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nThe White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\n* physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n* chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\n* operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\n* design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\n* specific chemical inventories.\n \nThe White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant ensures that the process safety information is available to all White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  The EHS & T Coordinator is responsible for maintaining and updating this information, as needed.\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of chlorine and other chemicals used in our process.  Information regarding toxicity, environmental impacts, corrosion concerns, inadvertent mixing hazards, and other safety and health concerns are addressed and communicated to the appropriate parties.\nThe White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant also maintains numerous technical documen"

These documents are used to:\n\n* train employees,\n* perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\n* help maintain the equipment.\n\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the Chlorination Process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant performed and will periodically update process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the Chlorination Process to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  Within this program, the Chlorination Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nTo perform the PHAs, White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, inclu"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Chlorination Process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the EHS Committee for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nWhite House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Chlorination Process operation should be safely performed.  These written procedures address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n* normal startup,\n* normal operations,\n* temporary operations,\n* emergency shutdown,\n* normal shutdown, and\n* initial startup of a new process.\n \n\n\n The written operating procedures include:\n \n* steps for safely conducting process tasks,\n* applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations, and\n* safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and action(s) to take in the event of an exposure to a hazardous substance.\n\n4.4  Training\n\nThe White House Utilitity District Water Treatment Plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.
